| 0:01:57| We want to postpone 11A for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=117)|
| 0:01:59| It's the 305 and 309 West Depot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=119)|

| 0:02:15| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=135)|
| 0:02:17| 11A is postponed for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=137)|
| 0:02:19| Anything else for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=139)|
| 0:02:21| Or to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=141)|
| 0:02:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=143)|
| 0:02:25| Consent items are 11K through 11AF| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=145)|
| 0:02:27| which are Certificates of Compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=147)|
| 0:02:29| and 12I through 12N| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=149)|
| 0:02:31| 202s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=151)|
| 0:02:33| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=153)|
| 0:02:35| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=155)|
| 0:02:37| I would like to ask Jim York to come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=157)|
| 0:02:39| especially on 11K through 11AF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=159)|
| 0:02:42| It's a little bit unusual that we have so many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=162)|
| 0:02:44| grocery stores| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=164)|
| 0:02:46| but we have some changes taking place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=166)|
| 0:02:48| and Jim, you might tell us what that's about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=168)|
| 0:02:50| Jim York,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=170)|
| 0:02:52| Finance Director for the City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=172)|
| 0:02:54| What you have before you is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=174)|
| 0:02:56| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=176)|
| 0:02:58| issuance of a Certificate of Compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=178)|
| 0:03:00| This is the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=180)|
| 0:03:02| step in an application for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=182)|
| 0:03:04| whining grocery stores| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=184)|
| 0:03:06| and this is required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=186)|
| 0:03:08| by the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=188)|
| 0:03:10| before they can apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=190)|
| 0:03:12| They have to receive the Certificate of Compliance from the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=192)|
| 0:03:14| and that involves a background check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=194)|
| 0:03:16| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=196)|
| 0:03:18| a zoning check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=198)|
| 0:03:20| So that's, again, the first step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=200)|
| 0:03:22| in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=202)|
| 0:03:24| And just for your information, there will be another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=204)|
| 0:03:26| batch in two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=206)|
| 0:03:28| and perhaps even after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=208)|
| 0:03:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=210)|
| 0:03:32| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=212)|
| 0:03:34| Yeah, I think we cured my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=214)|
| 0:03:36| There's 22 of these on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=216)|
| 0:03:39| for folks to know before we just run them through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=219)|
| 0:03:41| on a consent item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=221)|
| 0:03:43| But I'm sure everyone's been waiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=223)|
| 0:03:45| and is excited. I guess I should ask, Jim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=225)|
| 0:03:47| what is the magic date? Is it July 1, June 1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=227)|
| 0:03:49| Well, July 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=229)|
| 0:03:51| is the date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=231)|
| 0:03:53| but there is not a provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=233)|
| 0:03:55| in state law, at least at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=235)|
| 0:03:57| time, that they can stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=237)|
| 0:03:59| before that. So it will probably be after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=239)|
| 0:04:01| July 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=241)|
| 0:04:03| And again, I want to emphasize that the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=243)|
| 0:04:05| is granted by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=245)|
| 0:04:08| What we're doing is doing our certificate of compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=248)|
| 0:04:10| The TBI actually looks at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=250)|
| 0:04:12| compliance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=252)|
| 0:04:14| The TBI is doing the background checks on all of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=254)|
| 0:04:16| as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=256)|
| 0:04:18| And so they do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=258)|
| 0:04:20| Will we have any role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=260)|
| 0:04:22| with regard to sale to minors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=262)|
| 0:04:24| or is that just the same as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=264)|
| 0:04:26| it always is for hard liquor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=266)|
| 0:04:28| or other things that aren't covered by our beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=268)|
| 0:04:30| It would be the same as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=270)|
| 0:04:32| you know, alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=272)|
| 0:04:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=274)|
| 0:04:36| Thank you, Vice Mayor Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=276)|
| 0:04:38| Thank you, Mayor. We just thought maybe it might be a good idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=278)|
| 0:04:40| if Will was able to read all 22 of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=280)|
| 0:04:42| You know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=282)|
| 0:04:44| Right, Will?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=284)|
| 0:04:46| Let's just pretend he did, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=286)|
| 0:04:48| There's no second on that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=288)|
| 0:04:50| I didn't hear a second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=290)|
| 0:04:52| That wasn't a motion either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=292)|
| 0:04:54| Okay, so we do have a motion and a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=294)|
| 0:04:56| don't we? Or we do not. Okay, I need a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=296)|
| 0:04:58| and a second on the consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=298)|
| 0:05:00| So moved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=300)|
| 0:05:02| Any more discussion? All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=302)|
| 0:05:05| Any opposed? The consent items are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=305)|

| 0:06:42| This is the second of its kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=402)|
| 0:06:44| in Knoxville so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=404)|
| 0:06:46| The other one is at the intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=406)|
| 0:06:48| of University Commons Way and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=408)|
| 0:06:50| Joe Johnson Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=410)|
| 0:06:52| These green lanes are another way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=412)|
| 0:06:54| to make our roads safer for bicycles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=414)|
| 0:06:56| and vehicles to share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=416)|
| 0:06:58| St. Patrick's Day at 4 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=418)|
| 0:07:00| at the south end of the Gay Street Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=420)|
| 0:07:02| So we invite everyone to come out for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=422)|
| 0:07:04| Will that be celebrated with green beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=424)|
| 0:07:06| Green beer? I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=426)|
| 0:07:08| But if you'd like to take us out afterwards for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=428)|
| 0:07:10| Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=430)|
| 0:07:12| So next week, as Council knows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=432)|
| 0:07:14| I'll hold my annual operating budget hearings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=434)|
| 0:07:16| and those will take place over three days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=436)|
| 0:07:18| Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=438)|
| 0:07:20| with different departments scheduled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=440)|

| 0:07:30| slash budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=450)|
| 0:07:32| The hearings will be held here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=452)|
| 0:07:34| in the City-County Building in room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=454)|
| 0:07:36| 453.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=456)|
| 0:07:38| And just a reminder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=458)|
| 0:07:40| city offices will be closed next Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=460)|
| 0:07:42| the 25th for Good Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=462)|
| 0:07:44| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=464)|
| 0:07:46| that is the end of my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=466)|
| 0:07:48| Council reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=468)|
| 0:07:50| Councilman Stair? Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=470)|
| 0:07:52| I've invited Patience Melnick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=472)|
| 0:07:54| with Keep Knoxville Beautiful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=474)|
| 0:07:56| here to describe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=476)|
| 0:07:58| a new graffiti program they had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=478)|
| 0:08:00| So if you want to come on down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=480)|
| 0:08:02| thank you so much for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=482)|
| 0:08:04| I thought it would be just good for the Council and the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=484)|
| 0:08:06| to hear a little bit about the new program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=486)|
| 0:08:08| Thanks for having me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=488)|
| 0:08:10| I wanted to tell you about our new graffiti abatement program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=490)|
| 0:08:12| Our program has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=492)|
| 0:08:14| four components.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=494)|
| 0:08:16| The first is kits that we're giving away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=496)|
| 0:08:18| for free to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=498)|
| 0:08:20| And the kits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=500)|
| 0:08:22| were paid for by the City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=502)|
| 0:08:24| We worked with public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=504)|
| 0:08:26| They ordered and paid for the kits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=506)|
| 0:08:28| The kits, we're tailoring them to different types of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=508)|
| 0:08:30| graffiti.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=510)|
| 0:08:32| But we have at our disposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=512)|
| 0:08:34| to put in the kits chemical paint remover,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=514)|
| 0:08:36| drop cloths, gloves, steel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=516)|
| 0:08:38| wool, metal scrub brushes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| paint trays, rollers and naps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=520)|
| 0:08:42| and paint brushes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=522)|
| 0:08:44| We have 10 on hand and up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=524)|
| 0:08:46| 30 promised by the City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=526)|
| 0:08:48| The second component is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=528)|
| 0:08:50| outreach and support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=530)|
| 0:08:52| It used to be that when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=532)|
| 0:08:54| folks who were victims of graffiti| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=534)|
| 0:08:56| received a letter, they would receive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=536)|
| 0:08:58| a letter from codes enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=538)|
| 0:09:00| asking them to take care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=540)|
| 0:09:02| of the problem or there would be consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=542)|
| 0:09:04| Now they've added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=544)|
| 0:09:06| a couple of sentences saying that they can contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=546)|
| 0:09:08| us for the graffiti kits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=548)|
| 0:09:10| as well as for information and support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=550)|
| 0:09:12| You know, there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=552)|
| 0:09:14| best practices and different ways to really remove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=554)|
| 0:09:16| graffiti and it's not really a straightforward thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=556)|
| 0:09:18| so they can contact us for that support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=558)|
| 0:09:20| As well, we have a webpage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=560)|
| 0:09:22| and social media so we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=562)|
| 0:09:24| trying to educate and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=564)|
| 0:09:26| inform the public about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=566)|
| 0:09:28| The third| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=568)|
| 0:09:30| element is we are a volunteer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=570)|
| 0:09:32| organization and so we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=572)|
| 0:09:34| trying within our organization to take some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=574)|
| 0:09:36| responsibility too for getting out into the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=576)|
| 0:09:38| and taking care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=578)|
| 0:09:40| of some of this graffiti.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=580)|
| 0:09:42| Last Saturday at the East Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=582)|
| 0:09:44| community cleanup, there were about 300 folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=584)|
| 0:09:46| who came out, mostly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=586)|
| 0:09:48| to pick up litter, but we had about a dozen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=588)|
| 0:09:50| go out and take care of two different walls of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=590)|
| 0:09:52| graffiti.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=592)|
| 0:09:54| Finally, thanks to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=594)|
| 0:09:56| Parks and Rec Challenge grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=596)|
| 0:09:58| we have the funds to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=598)|
| 0:10:00| a mural this spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=600)|
| 0:10:02| We're working with a local artist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=602)|
| 0:10:04| Denise Stewart-Sanabria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=604)|
| 0:10:06| and she has designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=606)|
| 0:10:08| what I would call a paint-by-numbers style| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=608)|
| 0:10:10| so that people in the community can take part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=610)|
| 0:10:12| in creating that art| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=612)|
| 0:10:14| piece, just a more positive way to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=614)|
| 0:10:16| this surface that might otherwise be graffitied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=616)|
| 0:10:18| That is going to be below| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=618)|
| 0:10:20| Morningside Park along the greenway there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=620)|
| 0:10:22| before it turns into Riverside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=622)|
| 0:10:24| Drive. In closing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=624)|
| 0:10:26| I just wanted to say thank you to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=626)|
| 0:10:28| City Council Member Marshall Stare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=628)|
| 0:10:30| This was really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=630)|
| 0:10:32| born out of ideas that he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=632)|
| 0:10:34| had to help the community with this problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=634)|
| 0:10:36| and he has very generously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=636)|
| 0:10:38| donated some 202 funds, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=638)|
| 0:10:40| thank you. Also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=640)|
| 0:10:42| thank you to the Public Service Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=642)|
| 0:10:44| for supplying the kits, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=644)|
| 0:10:46| to Parks and Rec's Department for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=646)|
| 0:10:48| the Challenge grant. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=648)|
| 0:10:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=650)|
| 0:10:52| I just wanted to bring it down. A lot of times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=652)|
| 0:10:54| we get complaints about graffiti.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=654)|
| 0:10:56| The best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=656)|
| 0:10:58| way to stop graffiti, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=658)|
| 0:11:00| ideally, is to catch the person committing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=660)|
| 0:11:02| the crime, but if you can't do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=662)|
| 0:11:04| which can be very difficult,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=664)|
| 0:11:06| is to remove the graffiti quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=666)|
| 0:11:08| Now we have a resource| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=668)|
| 0:11:10| in the community that can help with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=670)|
| 0:11:12| Victims of graffiti| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=672)|
| 0:11:14| are not left by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=674)|
| 0:11:16| themselves. They can contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=676)|
| 0:11:18| Keep Knoxville Beautiful, learn how to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=678)|
| 0:11:20| even be provided the tools to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=680)|
| 0:11:22| I think it's a good program and hopefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=682)|
| 0:11:24| we'll see how it goes and see if it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=684)|
| 0:11:26| helpful in cleaning up the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=686)|

| 0:14:58| time it takes to recoup the investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=898)|
| 0:15:00| in these meters? I realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=900)|
| 0:15:02| we have some old, beat-up ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=902)|

| 0:15:12| on investment or whatever in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=912)|
| 0:15:14| terms of the new meters. You'd have to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=914)|
| 0:15:16| something anyway, and I've tried the new ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=916)|
| 0:15:18| and they take your coins and actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=918)|

| 0:15:38| potential return on investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=938)|
| 0:15:40| is. We do not have those numbers now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=940)|

| 0:15:46| in this phase and then 400 sometime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=946)|
| 0:15:48| in the future? Yeah, there's roughly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| 1,500 meters or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=950)|

| 0:15:58| Jim, what is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| income now on parking meters that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=960)|
| 0:16:02| have, the existing and what's looked to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=962)|
| 0:16:04| the future? The current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=964)|
| 0:16:06| amount that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=966)|
| 0:16:08| we recover from parking meters just through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=968)|
| 0:16:10| the boxes is roughly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=970)|
| 0:16:12| 300,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| Clearly, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=974)|
| 0:16:16| insufficient to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=976)|
| 0:16:18| amortize the cost, but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=978)|
| 0:16:20| are looking at, again, various pricing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=980)|
| 0:16:22| models| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=982)|
| 0:16:24| to see where we might have to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=984)|
| 0:16:26| Again, the purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=986)|
| 0:16:28| I would point out that the purpose of meters is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=988)|
| 0:16:30| not to generate money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=990)|
| 0:16:32| but to generate turnover in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=992)|
| 0:16:34| the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=994)|
| 0:16:36| Again, we want to look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=996)|
| 0:16:38| in its entirety, not only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=998)|
| 0:16:40| on-street parking, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1000)|

| 0:18:18| projects where the contractor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1098)|
| 0:18:20| has failed to do what he was supposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1100)|
| 0:18:22| to or bellied up during the recession| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1102)|
| 0:18:24| and you're now getting to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1104)|
| 0:18:26| point where you can actually do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1106)|
| 0:18:28| the proper installation or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1108)|
| 0:18:30| correction. Is that fair? Yeah, and this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| is the first one that was big enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1112)|
| 0:18:34| to make it to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1114)|
| 0:18:36| There are some others that we've done, some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1116)|
| 0:18:38| smaller corrections. Under the threshold?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1118)|
| 0:18:40| Yeah, under the threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1120)|
| 0:18:42| We've done the paving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1122)|
| 0:18:44| for example, and that fell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| in with the paving program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| so you didn't see it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| And this particular one, we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| already paved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1132)|
| 0:18:54| And this contract is for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1134)|
| 0:18:56| adjusting the size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| of the detention pond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1138)|
| 0:19:00| to the approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| Yeah, we have contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1144)|
| 0:19:06| that sometimes go do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| not quite right, I gather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| Yeah. And so we have to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1150)|
| 0:19:12| there and actually redo the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1152)|
| 0:19:14| or adjust it. And that's why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1154)|
| 0:19:16| we have bonds on things because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1156)|
| 0:19:18| it often| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1158)|
| 0:19:20| is not done to spec and if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1160)|
| 0:19:22| happen to go belly up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1162)|
| 0:19:24| during the process or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| if they just abscond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1166)|
| 0:19:28| for one reason or another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1168)|

| 0:22:52| I was going to request that we pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1372)|
| 0:22:54| this and the two other related items on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1374)|
| 0:22:56| emergency. The property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1376)|
| 0:22:58| has an agreement with the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1378)|
| 0:23:00| on the portion of the property and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1380)|
| 0:23:02| want to have this expedited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1382)|
| 0:23:04| Which two items? It would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1384)|
| 0:23:06| 12B, D,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| and E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1388)|
| 0:23:10| It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1390)|
| 0:23:12| mostly closures of older| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1392)|
| 0:23:16| unfunctional snippets of road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1396)|
| 0:23:18| and alleyway that have not been used in decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1398)|
| 0:23:20| And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1400)|
| 0:23:22| they're using a portion of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1402)|
| 0:23:24| right now as an impound lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| and it's being leased and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1406)|
| 0:23:28| it would make the property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| and the state, I think, a lot more comfortable to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| and pass this. So it's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1412)|
| 0:23:34| passing on emergency basis? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1414)|
| 0:23:36| So first, so we're amending it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| So we have a motion and a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| to amend on emergency. We'll vote on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1420)|
| 0:23:42| and then we'll go back to the original motion as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1422)|
| 0:23:44| amended. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1424)|
| 0:23:46| this is on the emergency. All in favor say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1426)|
| 0:23:48| aye. Aye. Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1428)|

| 0:28:36| I'm at 2431 Hoyt Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1718)|
| 0:28:42| Okay. Well, good evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1722)|
| 0:28:44| everyone. I just got back off the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1724)|
| 0:28:46| interstate from Nashville. I met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1726)|
| 0:28:48| some of our state representatives there and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1728)|
| 0:28:50| sat in on a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| Today was actually a great day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| I'm really excited about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1734)|
| 0:28:56| the progress that was made today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| Unlike last week, which was a little shaky and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| rocky. But today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| sometimes with time, things just kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| wind down and with effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1746)|
| 0:29:08| What I would like to say is this. First of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| I would like to continue to ask that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| the Magnolia Corridor starts at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| firegrounds. I'll probably say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1754)|
| 0:29:16| that every time I come. I would like for you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| to take that into strong consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| Also, I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| if you guys know that school will be letting out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| on May the 19th. I believe it's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| exact day or the last date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| And I am highly disappointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| because a lot of groups and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1770)|
| 0:29:32| organizations have been discussing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| the fact that they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| working on strategies for our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1776)|
| 0:29:38| youth. Well, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| do not find that it should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| take several months to come up with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| plan or strategy for a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| that has been in existence for a long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1786)|
| 0:29:48| period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1788)|
| 0:29:50| One of my biggest fears, again, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| this summer that we have to repeat some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1792)|
| 0:29:54| same cycles that we've repeated over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1794)|
| 0:29:56| years. I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| believe that I have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1798)|
| 0:30:00| strategies that will be beneficial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1800)|
| 0:30:02| for our inner city and community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1802)|
| 0:30:04| And there's no need for delaying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| or discussing or having any meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| about it. But if anybody's willing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1808)|
| 0:30:10| sit down and listen to me or talk to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| me, of course, I'd be glad to share the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| with you. However, we do have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| groups and organizations that are already in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| that are struggling, that need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1818)|
| 0:30:20| a little assistance. And not only a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| assistance, I think they need some of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1822)|
| 0:30:24| crooked places straightened, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1824)|
| 0:30:26| Those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| children will be getting out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1828)|
| 0:30:30| of school. And when I was growing up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1830)|
| 0:30:32| there was a program called NYC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1832)|
| 0:30:34| And we looked forward to that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| And it was like during the summer where the teenagers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| had jobs. It taught| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1838)|
| 0:30:40| them about money. You got to learn about a bank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1840)|
| 0:30:42| account. It actually gave you responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1842)|
| 0:30:44| and accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1844)|
| 0:30:46| That is Mrs. From Our Inner City at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1846)|
| 0:30:48| time. I invite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1848)|
| 0:30:50| everyone to visit my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| Facebook page. I know it's a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1852)|
| 0:30:54| lot of stuff on there. I stay busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| But I try to give you the best view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| that I can from our inner city so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1858)|
| 0:31:00| that you can see what's actually going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1860)|
| 0:31:02| on so we don't have to keep repeating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| the cycle and we can understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1864)|
| 0:31:06| First of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| I'm so honored. His name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| is William Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1870)|
| 0:31:12| He's the chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| there in Nashville. At first it was kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1874)|
| 0:31:16| rocky the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1876)|
| 0:31:18| He became my Facebook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| friend the other day. So he can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1880)|
| 0:31:22| kind of see what I'm seeing and where I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1882)|
| 0:31:24| coming from now. So we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1884)|
| 0:31:26| actually got him to agree with the bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| today, which was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1888)|
| 0:31:30| big plus. And we're looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| forward to working together with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1892)|
| 0:31:34| more things, even with the Black Caucus. So I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1894)|
| 0:31:36| very excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1896)|
| 0:31:38| Our inner city youth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1898)|
| 0:31:40| need jobs and they definitely need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1900)|
| 0:31:42| something to do with this time because there's not a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1902)|
| 0:31:44| of activities for them. Our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| young men and women that are getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1906)|
| 0:31:48| incarcerated at high numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| I think the dust is settling now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| so I can't get in touch with the chief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| and Nate and I think the other guy's name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1914)|
| 0:31:56| is David. I'm not for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1916)|
| 0:31:58| sure with the county. I would love to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1918)|
| 0:32:00| sit down and talk with you guys so we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| work on a better relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| with the community. I stood on a corner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1924)|
| 0:32:06| at the corner of McCalla| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1926)|
| 0:32:08| and Chestnut last week. Every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1928)|
| 0:32:10| day of the week. I even went on the weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| I just observed everybody. I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| not being biased toward no one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| and I was really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| shocked by some of the results| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1938)|
| 0:32:20| that I had. And then also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| I went back last Saturday and Sunday and actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1942)|
| 0:32:24| it was a lot better. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1944)|
| 0:32:26| if we could get the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| to come and support each other, not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1948)|
| 0:32:30| only that, our leaders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1950)|
| 0:32:32| and excuse me for saying this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1952)|
| 0:32:34| our leaders to me have lost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1954)|
| 0:32:36| their way. I am challenging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| our neighborhood churches because there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1958)|
| 0:32:40| several in a block. If| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1960)|
| 0:32:42| they would just wake up and do what God| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1962)|
| 0:32:44| has called them to do, it would help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1964)|
| 0:32:46| improve relationships within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1966)|
| 0:32:48| the community, with the government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| policing and everything like that. I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| want to be happy. One minute, Ms. Scholar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| I just want to be happy and would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1974)|
| 0:32:56| to just get a chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| at some hope because right now to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1978)|
| 0:33:00| honest with you, sometimes I feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1980)|
| 0:33:02| like hope is about gone, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| even if I have to sacrifice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1984)|
| 0:33:06| my hopes and dreams, I would like to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1986)|
| 0:33:08| our community move forward and our people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1988)|
| 0:33:10| grow. And that will be all for today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1990)|
| 0:33:12| Thank you for your attention. You guys have a wonderful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| evening and I look forward to seeing you next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| Thank you, Ms. Scholar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=1996)|
| 0:33:20| Next we have Eddie Young.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2000)|
| 0:33:22| Thank you for being here, Eddie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| State your name and address for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| and I'll start the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2006)|
| 0:33:28| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2008)|
| 0:33:30| Eddie Young, 1709 Campfire Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2010)|
| 0:33:32| Knoxville, 37931.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| Please make sure that microphone is aimed at you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| so we can hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2016)|
| 0:33:38| Over the last year, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2018)|
| 0:33:40| Knoxville Homeless Collective, facilitated by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| the East Tennessee Peace and Justice Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| has crafted and distributed to each of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2024)|
| 0:33:46| a proposal to address the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| issue of homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| We have crafted and distributed to each of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| a proposed City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2032)|
| 0:33:54| Homeless Bill of Rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2034)|
| 0:33:56| The need for this bill is driven by our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| contention that the homeless community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| of Knoxville is systematically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| profiled and discriminated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2042)|
| 0:34:04| against and is therefore deserving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2044)|
| 0:34:06| of being a protected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2046)|
| 0:34:08| class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2048)|
| 0:34:10| In theory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2050)|
| 0:34:12| we all are protected by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| the same rights, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2054)|
| 0:34:16| anyone who lives, works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2056)|
| 0:34:18| and plays in this city with their eyes open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2058)|
| 0:34:20| knows that it does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2060)|
| 0:34:22| exist in practicality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| This bill of rights would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2064)|
| 0:34:26| enforce the practical protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| of our neighbors who experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| homelessness, moving us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| beyond this theory and into reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2072)|
| 0:34:34| The City of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| Knoxville prides itself in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2076)|
| 0:34:38| efforts and resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| poured into plans and strategies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2080)|
| 0:34:42| to reduce and perhaps even eradicate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2082)|
| 0:34:44| homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2084)|
| 0:34:46| This bill would in no way undermine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| or distract from those efforts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| nor would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| it quench the incentive of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| experiencing homelessness to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| pursue and access these resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| contrary to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2098)|
| 0:35:00| propaganda that suggests otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| The truth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| is these resources do not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| come to bear on all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2106)|
| 0:35:08| those who are experiencing homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| There is simply not enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| affordable housing and those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| experiencing homelessness and are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2114)|
| 0:35:16| continuously and systematically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| discriminated against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| have arrests and charges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| piled on and piled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| on and piled on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| and are unable to access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| many of the resources that the cities and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2128)|
| 0:35:30| non-profit organizations provide and offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2130)|
| 0:35:34| In addition, this bill would actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2134)|
| 0:35:36| assist in our efforts in decriminalizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| homelessness, and whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| it's the accumulation of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| public intoxication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| arrests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| and until our data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| comes through, I think we're firmly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| convinced that most of the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| intoxication arrests that happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| are those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| experiencing homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| I don't think there's anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| who believes that Cumberland Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| is not covered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| with UT students who are publicly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| intoxicated, but when you check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2168)|
| 0:36:10| a 24-hour arrest report daily as I do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2170)|
| 0:36:12| you never see a UT student picked up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| for public intox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2174)|
| 0:36:16| You rarely see people picked up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| coming out of Bars of Gay Street or Market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| Square picked up for public intox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2180)|
| 0:36:22| It seems to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2182)|
| 0:36:24| 7, 6, 9,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| even 9 times out of 10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| when someone is picked up for public intox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| it's someone who's experiencing homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| And we believe that's because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| they're being profiled and they're being discriminated against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| So whether it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| the accumulation of those charges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| or the accumulation of charges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| of criminal trespass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2202)|
| 0:36:44| And if you're an employer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2204)|
| 0:36:46| you can imagine what that sounds like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2206)|
| 0:36:48| when somebody has to put down criminal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| trespass because they were on a sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| where they're not supposed to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2212)|
| 0:36:54| An employer doesn't know what criminal trespassing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| An employer doesn't know what molesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| a dumpster is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2220)|
| 0:37:04| So we're contending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2224)|
| 0:37:06| that even this bill in protecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| those who are experiencing homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| from these frivolous charges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2230)|
| 0:37:12| these unequal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| charges, would actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| help in our city's efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| to get people out of homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2238)|
| 0:37:22| Access to public space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| is a huge part of this bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2244)|
| 0:37:26| We cannot expect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| those who have nowhere to go to simply disappear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2248)|
| 0:37:30| for the night and reappear in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| You have one minute, Eddie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2252)|
| 0:37:36| When we make laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| that say you cannot be on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| public property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2260)|
| 0:37:42| we have people who have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2262)|
| 0:37:44| nowhere to go, and it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2264)|
| 0:37:46| impossible for them to follow those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2266)|
| 0:37:48| laws, and thereby| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| we inherently criminalize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| And this is such a national| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2274)|
| 0:37:56| catastrophe that even the Department of Housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| and Urban Development has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2278)|
| 0:38:00| stated that communities and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2280)|
| 0:38:02| cities who are not actively working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| towards decriminalizing homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| are in jeopardy of not getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| funds for their continuum of care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2288)|
| 0:38:10| We'd like for you to seriously consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| passing this Homeless Bill of Rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2292)|
| 0:38:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2294)|
| 0:38:20| Next is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2300)|
| 0:38:22| Patricia Ramston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2302)|
| 0:38:28| Thank you for being here, Ms. Ramston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2310)|
| 0:38:32| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2312)|
| 0:38:36| My name is Patricia Ramston,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| and I live at 8902| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| Fox Lake Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2320)|
| 0:38:42| And over this last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| year, it has been my privilege| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2324)|
| 0:38:46| to work as a servant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| with the Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2328)|
| 0:38:50| Homeless Collective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2330)|
| 0:38:52| as we have worked on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2332)|
| 0:38:54| several measures dealing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| the imminent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2336)|
| 0:38:58| harm and danger that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2338)|
| 0:39:00| homelessness causes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2340)|
| 0:39:04| This collective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| spent about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2346)|
| 0:39:08| four or five months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| writing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2350)|
| 0:39:12| the bill that you have before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2352)|
| 0:39:14| This was not something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2354)|
| 0:39:16| they took lightly. It was something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| that came out of their own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2358)|
| 0:39:20| experiences and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2360)|
| 0:39:22| experiences of others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2362)|
| 0:39:24| And it is based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2364)|
| 0:39:26| similar bills that are being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2366)|
| 0:39:28| presented in cities across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| our nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| Because unfortunately, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| is not a Knoxville problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| This is a national| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2376)|
| 0:39:38| problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| But it is a problem we need to care for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2382)|
| 0:39:46| The important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2386)|
| 0:39:48| thing to always remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| this is not a bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2392)|
| 0:39:54| that is in opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2394)|
| 0:39:56| to any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| department, any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2398)|
| 0:40:00| program that the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| has to offer. The city has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| worked hard on trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2406)|
| 0:40:08| the needs of the homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| and has, in fact, a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| plan to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2412)|
| 0:40:14| This is a complement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2414)|
| 0:40:16| to those plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2416)|
| 0:40:18| to your hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2418)|
| 0:40:20| This is to ensure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| that basic rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| are being maintained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| at the same time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2426)|
| 0:40:28| that that plan is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| being fully implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2430)|
| 0:40:32| So it's a dovetail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2432)|
| 0:40:34| effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2434)|
| 0:40:36| The portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2436)|
| 0:40:38| of the plan that I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2438)|
| 0:40:40| like to specifically speak to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2440)|
| 0:40:44| is dear to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| Because in addition to serving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| the collective, I also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| am a servant of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2450)|
| 0:40:52| compassion with a group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| that meets on Mondays and Fridays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| We feed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2456)|
| 0:40:58| the homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2458)|
| 0:41:00| We give women tampons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2460)|
| 0:41:02| We're very dangerous that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2462)|
| 0:41:04| We do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2464)|
| 0:41:06| toothpaste and toothbrushes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2466)|
| 0:41:08| basic needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| that they don't get met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2470)|
| 0:41:14| But one night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2474)|
| 0:41:16| while we were doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2476)|
| 0:41:18| we were told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2478)|
| 0:41:20| by police officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| was not permissible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2484)|
| 0:41:26| We could not use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| public land to feed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| the homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2490)|
| 0:41:36| So we went about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2496)|
| 0:41:38| finding a parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2498)|
| 0:41:40| lot of a business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2500)|
| 0:41:42| that was close by to where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| camps were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| and we pay $50| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| a month for the privilege| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| of feeding the homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2510)|
| 0:41:56| The concern for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| is not only the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2518)|
| 0:42:00| that needs, basic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| needs, were not being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2522)|
| 0:42:04| met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2524)|
| 0:42:06| The concern is also a religious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2526)|
| 0:42:08| one because I'm also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| a pastor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| And to be told that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| could not feed the hungry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| that I could not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2536)|
| 0:42:18| clothe the naked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2538)|
| 0:42:20| that I could not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2540)|
| 0:42:22| provide blankets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2542)|
| 0:42:24| and sleeping bags,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2544)|
| 0:42:26| and yes, even tampons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2546)|
| 0:42:30| goes against everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2550)|
| 0:42:32| I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2552)|
| 0:42:34| And what I believe is the true| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| meaning of the separation of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| church and state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2558)|
| 0:42:40| You have one minute, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2560)|
| 0:42:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| It is difficult whenever you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2564)|
| 0:42:46| hear us speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2566)|
| 0:42:48| to imagine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2568)|
| 0:42:50| all the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2570)|
| 0:42:52| On Monday nights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2572)|
| 0:42:54| we may feed 85.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2574)|
| 0:42:56| That's just us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2576)|
| 0:42:58| in our little location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2578)|
| 0:43:00| without any advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2580)|
| 0:43:02| But what I'd like for you to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2582)|
| 0:43:04| is to get a glimpse of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| people. So I would ask that all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2586)|
| 0:43:08| my brothers and sisters who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| homeless, please stand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| and that all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| those who support them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2594)|
| 0:43:16| whether they are with our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2596)|
| 0:43:18| group or any other group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| if you support the need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2600)|
| 0:43:22| of the homeless to have food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2602)|
| 0:43:24| and shelter and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| basic medical care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2606)|
| 0:43:28| if you would please stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2608)|
| 0:43:34| It's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| a small group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2616)|
| 0:43:38| This is the ones who were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2618)|
| 0:43:40| willing to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| to a council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2622)|
| 0:43:44| There could be many more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| Thank you so much for your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2626)|
| 0:43:48| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2628)|
| 0:43:54| Stephen Hemingway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2634)|
| 0:44:04| Sir, please state your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| My name is Stephen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| I don't have an address because I live in a homeless camp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| I'm just here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| to say, I guess...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2656)|
| 0:44:18| I'm here to say I'm supporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2658)|
| 0:44:20| the people that do help us out that are homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| I tried with certain churches and stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2662)|
| 0:44:24| like that and it is kind of heartbreaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| because there's people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2666)|
| 0:44:28| that are my friends that actually passed away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2668)|
| 0:44:30| that got frozen to the ground in front of the cemetery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2670)|
| 0:44:32| because cops told them they couldn't be in certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2672)|
| 0:44:34| areas. So he went to the cemetery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2674)|
| 0:44:36| and he passed away in front of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2676)|
| 0:44:38| It's just pretty pathetic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2678)|
| 0:44:40| that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2680)|
| 0:44:42| police and people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2682)|
| 0:44:44| push people around like they're nobody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2684)|
| 0:44:46| like a piece of trash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2686)|
| 0:44:48| Me and my wife, personally, we get pushed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2688)|
| 0:44:50| around. We've been in two camps now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2690)|
| 0:44:52| and they told us personally they pick up our things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2692)|
| 0:44:54| and get out in 10 minutes. They didn't give us time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2694)|
| 0:44:56| to get our gatherings, especially my wife| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2696)|
| 0:44:58| who lost a daughter who had ashes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| in her belongings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2700)|
| 0:45:02| They threw them away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| and they just only gave us 10 minutes to get our stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| and get out. We have no privacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2706)|
| 0:45:08| We have no laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| It seems like every day we turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| around, it's just we walk down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| the street, we get bothered by police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| I almost got arrested just a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2716)|
| 0:45:18| days ago. I was walking down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2718)|
| 0:45:20| I work, granted, but I don't choose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| to be homeless, but it's kind of hard to get a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| It's also kind of hard around here to get things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| But anyways, I was arrested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2726)|
| 0:45:28| by a police officer because I have a limp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| in my leg. He thought I was intoxicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| He was about to arrest me for a public intoxication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| without even a breathalyzer test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| And speaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2736)|
| 0:45:38| of the time I was talking to him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2738)|
| 0:45:40| some student, I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2740)|
| 0:45:42| if it was a college student or just some regular pedestrian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2742)|
| 0:45:44| got hit by a car right behind me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| because he was walking drunk. The only thing the cop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2746)|
| 0:45:48| told him to do was go back home and sleep on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| Just saying, I don't like being pushed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2750)|
| 0:45:52| around, but when you're homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2752)|
| 0:45:54| I guess you got to do what you got to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| And now I'm done speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| Thanks for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2758)|
| 0:46:00| having me here. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2760)|
| 0:46:06| Next is Nicole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2766)|
| 0:46:08| Fed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2768)|
| 0:46:12| Thank you for being here, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2772)|
| 0:46:16| I'm Nicole, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| my address is a homeless camp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| Mainly, the Bill of Rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2780)|
| 0:46:22| targets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2782)|
| 0:46:24| the homeless people, but not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| just people that live in camps. There's people that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2786)|
| 0:46:28| can't go into CARM| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| that we try to help. There's people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2790)|
| 0:46:32| that, like me, who personally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| doesn't want to go into CARM,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2794)|
| 0:46:36| knows it's there but doesn't want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| but wants to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2798)|
| 0:46:40| be in a camp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2800)|
| 0:46:42| but doesn't want to be pushed around all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2802)|
| 0:46:44| We've moved twice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2804)|
| 0:46:46| in the past two months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2806)|
| 0:46:48| so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| we want an area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| where we can stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| there and not have to worry about being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2816)|
| 0:46:58| pushed around constantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| Also, there's one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2820)|
| 0:47:02| part of the bill that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2822)|
| 0:47:04| write to all municipal agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2824)|
| 0:47:06| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| for instance, that's like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| the courthouse. When you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2830)|
| 0:47:12| homeless, they don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| send out warrants or they don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2834)|
| 0:47:16| issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| your right to appear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2838)|
| 0:47:20| in court. They don't issue it. They just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2840)|
| 0:47:22| tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| I had to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2844)|
| 0:47:26| appear in court and I didn't know about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2846)|
| 0:47:28| If it wasn't for somebody who wasn't homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2848)|
| 0:47:30| that actually had to appear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2850)|
| 0:47:32| with my case, I wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| have even known I had to go to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2854)|
| 0:47:36| So that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2856)|
| 0:47:38| another main issue in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2858)|
| 0:47:40| bill of rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| Other than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2862)|
| 0:47:44| it's pretty much just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2864)|
| 0:47:46| focusing on all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2866)|
| 0:47:48| our rights that aren't touched| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2868)|
| 0:47:50| with everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2870)|
| 0:47:52| When we move, we have a right to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| our property. It is our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2874)|
| 0:47:56| I understand getting an eviction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| notice and all that, but it is our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2878)|
| 0:48:00| We should be able to get it or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2880)|
| 0:48:02| have it replaced if it is taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| Other than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| that's pretty much it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2886)|

| 0:48:26| My name is Janedris Anderson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2906)|
| 0:48:28| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2908)|
| 0:48:30| my address is 418| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| Broadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2912)|
| 0:48:34| which is Carm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2914)|
| 0:48:36| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2916)|
| 0:48:38| well, what I have to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2918)|
| 0:48:40| is, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2920)|
| 0:48:42| as homeless people, we should have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2922)|
| 0:48:44| rights. I don't know how much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2924)|
| 0:48:46| money is given to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| Carm and other places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2928)|
| 0:48:50| like that a year, but I'd say it's over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| a couple million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2932)|
| 0:48:54| But what they do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2934)|
| 0:48:56| is you get up in the morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2936)|
| 0:48:58| and you take a shower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2938)|
| 0:49:00| or whatnot. Six o'clock in the morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| you leave. No matter if it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2942)|
| 0:49:04| raining, snowing, sleeting, it don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2944)|
| 0:49:06| matter. You're out until six o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2946)|
| 0:49:08| at night. So where else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2948)|
| 0:49:10| do these people have to go? And you've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| some people that take medication that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2952)|
| 0:49:14| they have to take this medication to survive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2954)|
| 0:49:16| Well, it might make them sleepy or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2956)|
| 0:49:18| something, so they go cup theirself on a bench,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| go to sleep, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2960)|
| 0:49:22| and cop walks by them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2962)|

| 0:49:36| them to be drowsy or dizziness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| You know, so like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| automatically they think, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2980)|

| 0:49:50| get them, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2990)|
| 0:49:52| trades or something. Don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2992)|
| 0:49:54| throw them out. If you want us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2994)|
| 0:49:56| off the streets, don't throw us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2996)|
| 0:49:58| outside. I mean, give us, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=2998)|
| 0:50:00| make them have, like, a trade school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3000)|
| 0:50:02| at Karm or something so these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3002)|
| 0:50:04| can learn stuff and get jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| You know what I'm saying? It's just like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| you throw somebody out at six o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| in the morning, whether it's raining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3010)|
| 0:50:12| You know, I've seen a man,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3012)|
| 0:50:14| like dude said, I've seen a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3014)|
| 0:50:16| man die that was not allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3016)|
| 0:50:18| to go into Karm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3018)|
| 0:50:20| It was like zero degrees outside. His name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| was Patches. Couple years ago, this man| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3022)|
| 0:50:24| froze to death, 60-something years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3024)|
| 0:50:26| Froze outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3026)|
| 0:50:28| And then you got, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3028)|
| 0:50:30| average person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3030)|
| 0:50:32| goes to sleep on a public bench| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| or in a park, nothing is said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3034)|
| 0:50:36| But a man with a backpack,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3036)|
| 0:50:38| couple blankets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3038)|
| 0:50:40| and they know he's homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3040)|
| 0:50:42| You know? Like, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| can't be here. You can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| camp out here. Or you can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3046)|
| 0:50:48| be in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3048)|
| 0:50:50| You know? I've seen, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3050)|
| 0:50:52| policemen go up to camps and be like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3052)|
| 0:50:54| okay, you got 24 hours to get out of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3054)|
| 0:50:56| They don't, like, let the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3056)|
| 0:50:58| get their belongings and the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3058)|
| 0:51:00| that belong to them, little mementos of their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3060)|
| 0:51:02| family, pictures of their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3062)|
| 0:51:04| They burn it. I mean, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| literally set fire to it, man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3066)|
| 0:51:08| You know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3068)|
| 0:51:10| Like, what if,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3070)|
| 0:51:12| and I don't mean this in a bad way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3072)|
| 0:51:14| what if somebody, like, set fire to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3074)|
| 0:51:16| your property? I mean, that's stuff you own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3076)|
| 0:51:18| And we don't have a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3078)|
| 0:51:20| But the little stuff we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3080)|
| 0:51:22| have, you know, we work for it. We go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3082)|
| 0:51:24| the VMC. We have to do little chores| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3084)|
| 0:51:26| and stuff to get, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3086)|
| 0:51:28| our IDs and our birth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3088)|
| 0:51:30| certificates for somebody to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3090)|
| 0:51:32| just walk in and take it away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| And I don't think that's right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3094)|
| 0:51:36| when you give, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3096)|
| 0:51:38| an organization, like, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3098)|
| 0:51:40| much money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3100)|
| 0:51:42| and all you get is food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| to take a shower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3104)|
| 0:51:46| I mean, like, why can't they have, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3106)|
| 0:51:48| GED classes or something in there to keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3108)|
| 0:51:50| people off the streets if you want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3110)|
| 0:51:52| us off the streets? You know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3112)|
| 0:51:54| Every homeless person, that's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3114)|
| 0:51:56| what everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3116)|
| 0:51:58| thinks they are, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3118)|
| 0:52:00| That's speculation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3120)|
| 0:52:02| and whatnot, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3122)|
| 0:52:04| I've been homeless before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3124)|
| 0:52:06| you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3126)|
| 0:52:08| And I tried every day. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| worked. I went to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| But I would have friends that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3132)|
| 0:52:14| I'm walking up the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3134)|
| 0:52:16| and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3136)|
| 0:52:18| just because I look different, I get treated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3138)|
| 0:52:20| different from the average| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3140)|
| 0:52:22| homeless person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3142)|
| 0:52:24| Don't take your bag in this store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3144)|
| 0:52:26| Other people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3146)|
| 0:52:28| they walk in behind me, drop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3148)|
| 0:52:30| your bag, but nothing said to me because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3150)|
| 0:52:32| I look different, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3152)|
| 0:52:34| know? But I just think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3154)|
| 0:52:36| that if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| want people to stay off the streets, give them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3158)|
| 0:52:40| some kind of activity to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| You have one minute, sir. Yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3162)|

| 0:52:46| with the money you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| give, like, CARM| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3168)|
| 0:52:50| and all of these, like, non-profit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3170)|
| 0:52:52| organizations, I mean, they could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| literally take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3174)|
| 0:52:56| it and be like, okay, we're starting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3176)|
| 0:52:58| this class to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3178)|
| 0:53:00| learn, teach how to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3180)|
| 0:53:02| electrician or be a, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| carpenter or something. Like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3184)|
| 0:53:06| just don't kick them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3186)|
| 0:53:08| And, like, that's all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3188)|
| 0:53:10| I have to say. Like, how can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3190)|
| 0:53:12| somebody progress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3192)|
| 0:53:14| in life when they're not given tools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3194)|
| 0:53:16| to progress? You're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3196)|
| 0:53:18| give somebody a couple million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3198)|
| 0:53:20| and we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3200)|
| 0:53:22| see that. We can't even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3202)|
| 0:53:24| get toilet paper and soap sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| at that place. Or even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3206)|
| 0:53:28| hot water. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3208)|
| 0:53:30| that's all I have to say on the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3210)|

| 0:53:58| Andrew Crickow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| Crickow. Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3240)|
| 0:54:02| Thank you. My address is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3242)|
| 0:54:04| wherever I'm allowed to lay my head at night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3244)|
| 0:54:06| before I'm currently homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3246)|
| 0:54:10| I'm really not sure where I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3250)|
| 0:54:12| begin with this. There's so many things that I could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3252)|
| 0:54:14| touch. Just where this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3254)|
| 0:54:16| Bill of Rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3256)|
| 0:54:18| has many points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3258)|
| 0:54:20| that, oh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3260)|
| 0:54:22| sorry, I'm also a member of the Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3262)|
| 0:54:24| Homeless Collective. You may have remembered me from one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3264)|
| 0:54:26| of the roundtable meetings I attended with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3266)|
| 0:54:28| I do remember you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3268)|
| 0:54:30| I do understand that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3270)|
| 0:54:32| Knoxville does have a heart for its citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3272)|
| 0:54:36| And I just want to say that the homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3276)|
| 0:54:38| community, our citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3278)|
| 0:54:40| just because we don't have an address doesn't make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3280)|
| 0:54:42| us any less human than anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3282)|
| 0:54:44| I've heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3284)|
| 0:54:46| it say that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3286)|
| 0:54:48| are rights and laws that goes for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3288)|
| 0:54:50| everybody within the city limits of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3290)|
| 0:54:52| Knoxville and surrounding areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3292)|
| 0:54:54| But I don't see it being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3294)|
| 0:54:56| very fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3296)|
| 0:54:58| between those that have a residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3298)|
| 0:55:00| and those that don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3300)|
| 0:55:02| As some of the others have described,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3302)|
| 0:55:04| that even with CARM| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3304)|
| 0:55:06| a lot of people are not allowed in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3306)|
| 0:55:08| so they're left to suffer in the elements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3308)|
| 0:55:10| There's many people that have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3310)|
| 0:55:12| moved around from place to place simply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3312)|
| 0:55:14| because everything in Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3314)|
| 0:55:16| is owned. There are no free spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3316)|
| 0:55:18| for us to be able to lay our head| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3318)|
| 0:55:20| at night to where everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| is a criminal trespass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3322)|
| 0:55:24| We're not allowed to sit on sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3324)|
| 0:55:26| We're not allowed to lay down on a park bench| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3326)|
| 0:55:28| because of medication reasons or because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3328)|
| 0:55:30| blood sugar drops and we need to sit down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3330)|
| 0:55:32| before we fall down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3332)|
| 0:55:34| We are profiled and we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3334)|
| 0:55:36| sought out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| to be removed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| from the public view because we are such| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3340)|
| 0:55:42| a nuisance and a plague upon the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3342)|
| 0:55:44| And I'm here to tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3344)|
| 0:55:46| we're not. It's just because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3346)|
| 0:55:48| of our perception because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3348)|
| 0:55:50| maybe somebody five years ago did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3350)|
| 0:55:52| something therefore everybody in his situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| does the same thing and no we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3354)|
| 0:55:58| I'm one of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3358)|
| 0:56:00| who because of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3360)|
| 0:56:02| small mistake several years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3362)|
| 0:56:04| now has a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3364)|
| 0:56:06| felony charge that will follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3366)|
| 0:56:08| me for the rest of my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3368)|
| 0:56:10| Anyone who has tried to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3370)|
| 0:56:12| into public housing through KCDC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3372)|
| 0:56:14| or HUD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3374)|
| 0:56:16| you cannot qualify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3376)|
| 0:56:18| for that once you have a felony charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3378)|
| 0:56:20| There's no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3380)|
| 0:56:22| government funded housing options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3382)|
| 0:56:24| that I am eligible for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3384)|
| 0:56:26| There's nowhere I can go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3386)|
| 0:56:28| I'm not allowed at CARM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3388)|
| 0:56:30| I'm not allowed at Salvation Army.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3390)|
| 0:56:32| VMC is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3392)|
| 0:56:34| very few and far between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3394)|
| 0:56:36| with some of the services it's allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3396)|
| 0:56:38| to be able to give me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3398)|
| 0:56:40| So any of these donations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3400)|
| 0:56:42| and everything that are given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3402)|
| 0:56:44| to an entity known as CARM| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3404)|
| 0:56:46| to be able to help those that are less fortunate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3406)|
| 0:56:48| don't apply to me. I can't go there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3408)|
| 0:56:50| to get these resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3410)|
| 0:56:52| I'm not allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3412)|
| 0:56:54| There's many jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3414)|
| 0:56:56| that will not hire me because of my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3416)|
| 0:56:58| felony record. There's many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3418)|
| 0:57:00| places that I'm not allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3420)|
| 0:57:02| to be in. There's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3422)|
| 0:57:04| so many services that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3424)|
| 0:57:06| are available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3426)|
| 0:57:08| to people who qualify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3428)|
| 0:57:10| But the homeless community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3430)|
| 0:57:12| because of mistakes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3432)|
| 0:57:14| bad judgments, wrong place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3434)|
| 0:57:16| at the wrong time, now have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3436)|
| 0:57:18| a record that prevent them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3438)|
| 0:57:20| from getting these resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3440)|
| 0:57:22| And this Bill of Rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3442)|
| 0:57:26| is designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3446)|
| 0:57:28| to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| the homeless community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| us, easier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3452)|
| 0:57:34| access to resources to where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| we can get ahead. We can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3456)|
| 0:57:38| get a house. We can get a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3458)|
| 0:57:40| We can get off the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3460)|
| 0:57:42| But as long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3462)|
| 0:57:44| as we're profiled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| as long as we're continually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| being arrested or harassed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3468)|
| 0:57:50| for what appears to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3470)|
| 0:57:52| P.I. without doing examination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3472)|
| 0:57:54| to see if maybe it's because of a medication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3474)|
| 0:57:56| that we took without food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3476)|
| 0:57:58| because we weren't able to get food that day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3478)|
| 0:58:00| to where it causes dizziness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3480)|
| 0:58:02| or maybe there's a reaction between a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3482)|
| 0:58:04| of different pills that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3484)|
| 0:58:06| the doctor gives us, like that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3486)|
| 0:58:08| never happened before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3488)|
| 0:58:10| we get accused of being drunk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3490)|
| 0:58:12| One minute, sir. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3492)|
| 0:58:14| We get accused of being drunk and stoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3494)|
| 0:58:16| and we continually get arrested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3496)|
| 0:58:18| There's fines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3498)|
| 0:58:20| there's fees, probation and court costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3500)|
| 0:58:22| that keep mounting and mounting and mounting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3502)|
| 0:58:24| and for every step we try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3504)|
| 0:58:26| to take, we get set three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3506)|
| 0:58:28| back. We can't win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3508)|
| 0:58:30| There's no way to get ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3510)|
| 0:58:32| if we continually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3512)|
| 0:58:34| get arrested and harassed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3514)|
| 0:58:36| just for trying to exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3516)|
| 0:58:38| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3518)|
| 0:58:40| this Bill of Rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| hopefully will be able to give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3522)|
| 0:58:44| us that light at the end of the tunnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3524)|
| 0:58:46| so that we can see our way out of this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3526)|
| 0:58:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3528)|
| 0:58:50| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3530)|
| 0:58:54| Okay, council, that is the end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| of public forum and so we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160315?start=3536)|
