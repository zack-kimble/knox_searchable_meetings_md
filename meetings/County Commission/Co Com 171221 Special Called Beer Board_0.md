| 0:02:25| Can we get a report from the staff on the current situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=145)|
| 0:02:33| The current situation at this point, the bar is closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=153)|
| 0:02:42| Let me explain to the owner here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=162)|
| 0:02:45| First off, can you state your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=165)|
| 0:02:48| Christopher Getty, 226 Andrew Johnson Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=168)|
| 0:02:51| Mr. Getty, let me explain to you what's going on today so you'll have an opportunity to listen and affirm what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=171)|
| 0:02:58| The procedures here today is that the staff and the people on behalf of the county will be bringing some allegations against you, your business, and your beer permit, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=178)|
| 0:03:08| And so they'll be bringing these charges forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=188)|
| 0:03:11| You'll have an opportunity to hear what is said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=191)|
| 0:03:14| Then I will ask you if you affirm or deny these allegations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=194)|
| 0:03:18| And then I will give you an opportunity then to talk to this beer board and explain your position, give testimony on your behalf, to do whatever it is you would like for them to know under these conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=198)|
| 0:03:29| And then we'll turn it over to this body to either further ask you more questions or to deliberate and make a decision in your case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=209)|
| 0:03:37| Do you understand that, how we're going to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=217)|
| 0:03:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=219)|
| 0:03:40| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=220)|
| 0:03:41| Now then, we'll turn it back over to the staff for their particular allegations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=221)|
| 0:03:45| And Mr. Getty, listen very closely as to what they're saying so you'll understand what the position of the county is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=225)|
| 0:03:52| I'm going to ask the staff to come to the podium when they speak, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=232)|
| 0:04:02| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=242)|
| 0:04:03| Randy Lilly, building official, code administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=243)|
| 0:04:08| The genesis of my involvement here was from a fire that had developed at the premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=248)|
| 0:04:17| And after the investigators sent out the report, there were some triggers that came through that caused me to go out and do a side investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=257)|
| 0:04:30| And upon that, there were some observations made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=270)|
| 0:04:33| A deck was built on the back of this establishment that had not been permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=273)|
| 0:04:40| And there was egress issues there, structural issues that had not been reviewed or designed by a licensed state architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=280)|
| 0:04:50| This being a commercial job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=290)|
| 0:04:52| The other issue was the fact that there were approximately seven standing gas-fired heaters on this deck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=292)|
| 0:05:01| This was a wooden deck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=301)|
| 0:05:04| The fire had started in an upstairs area of the building, which appeared to be where someone may have been living on a temporary or permanent basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=304)|
| 0:05:17| That had been permitted as a storage area, so we had a mixed occupancy going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=317)|
| 0:05:23| And also the fact that someone was not supposed to be living up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=323)|
| 0:05:29| The fire bureau will speak more into that part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=329)|
| 0:05:33| Because they did not have a permit, the issues that were involved, I revoked their certificate of occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=333)|
| 0:05:41| I did that on December 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=341)|
| 0:05:44| And myself and a few of my staff went out, photographed, and the owner was very courteous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=344)|
| 0:05:52| He agreed to close the place down because I did stop or posted it unfit at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=352)|
| 0:06:01| It was unsafe for patrons to be coming in without it being thoroughly looked at by an architect and plans presented and re-permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=361)|
| 0:06:11| And that's where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=371)|
| 0:06:13| Did you bring copies of those pictures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=373)|
| 0:06:15| Pictures? I got the documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=375)|
| 0:06:19| I do have the pictures on laptop, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=379)|
| 0:06:22| We can shoot those up for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=382)|
| 0:06:24| If you give us about ten minutes, Sean will get that put up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=384)|
| 0:06:28| I'd be happy to, Chairman, to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=388)|
| 0:06:30| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=390)|
| 0:06:32| Anybody have questions for Mr. Lilly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=392)|
| 0:06:35| I think there was a date correction. You said you revoked his CO on the 21st. I think it was the 14th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=395)|
| 0:06:41| Thank you for that. I did write up the letter on the 14th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=401)|
| 0:06:46| It was not delivered until I met him there on premises the 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=406)|
| 0:06:52| That's today, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=412)|
| 0:06:54| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=414)|
| 0:06:56| The 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=416)|
| 0:06:57| The 19th. It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=417)|
| 0:06:59| On the 19th. So the 19th is when the owner had it in his hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=419)|
| 0:07:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=424)|
| 0:07:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=425)|
| 0:07:08| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=428)|
| 0:07:09| Anything else? All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=429)|
| 0:07:16| Any other testimony to be given by the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=436)|
| 0:07:29| I concur with everything that Randy spoke to there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=449)|
| 0:07:37| On 11-26, there was a fire on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=457)|
| 0:07:42| Had moderate damage to the apartment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=462)|
| 0:07:46| The apartment upstairs was not approved to be occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=466)|
| 0:07:50| The apartment requires a sprinkler system to be installed to be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=470)|
| 0:07:57| The deck constructed on the backside, we had no plans, permits, certificates of occupancy for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=477)|
| 0:08:04| It does require an architect engineer to approve that and design it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=484)|
| 0:08:12| We also have an occupant load issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=492)|
| 0:08:18| The door leading to that deck is an exit door for the bar area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=498)|
| 0:08:22| It has an occupant load over 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=502)|
| 0:08:25| The deck itself is large enough that it will have an occupant load over 50 as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=505)|
| 0:08:30| You're required to have two means of egress for an occupant load that large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=510)|
| 0:08:34| Presently, there is only one means of egress from that backside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=514)|
| 0:08:40| The door has to swing with egress, so there will have to be a second exit installed for that deck area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=520)|
| 0:08:48| The fire upstairs, what was the cause of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=528)|
| 0:08:51| It was a quartz heater, according to the investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=531)|
| 0:08:55| It was a quartz heater that was placed too close to a closed basket full of clothes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=535)|
| 0:09:01| What was it that led you to believe that there was an occupant upstairs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=541)|
| 0:09:05| There was a bed that was laid and testimony that the investigators got when they did their investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=545)|
| 0:09:12| On the investigation report—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=552)|
| 0:09:36| Bear with me here just one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=576)|
| 0:09:44| Justin Moore stated that he was working as a cook in the kitchen area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=584)|
| 0:09:50| but he had been staying upstairs, and he was out there the whole time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=590)|
| 0:09:56| Justin Moore stated that he was working as a cook in the kitchen area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=596)|
| 0:10:00| but he had been staying upstairs, and he was out there the night before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=600)|
| 0:10:07| and stated that he had turned the heater on, and it sounds like maybe he didn't turn the heater off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=607)|
| 0:10:12| What time was the fire?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=612)|
| 0:10:14| The fire?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=614)|
| 0:10:17| 148 Sunday on 11-26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=617)|
| 0:10:20| PM or AM?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=620)|
| 0:10:23| PM or AM?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=623)|
| 0:10:26| Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=626)|
| 0:10:28| Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=628)|
| 0:10:30| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=630)|
| 0:10:32| Mr. Bethlen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=632)|
| 0:10:33| Mr. Gatey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=633)|
| 0:10:35| He's not up yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=635)|
| 0:10:37| Oh, he's not up yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=637)|
| 0:10:38| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=638)|
| 0:10:39| Health Department then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=639)|
| 0:10:40| Well, can I ask a question of the investigator here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=640)|
| 0:10:46| I mean, if we're sticking with this staff member here, are we—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=646)|
| 0:10:50| I want to ask a question because there was something that was in that statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=650)|
| 0:10:53| I want to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=653)|
| 0:10:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=654)|
| 0:10:56| Is there a permit for Mr. Gatey to serve food at that place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=656)|
| 0:11:01| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=661)|
| 0:11:02| Our department only has a permit for the bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=662)|
| 0:11:05| There is not a permit for a kitchen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=665)|
| 0:11:08| We have not been notified to permit the kitchen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=668)|
| 0:11:13| So that's in violation, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=673)|
| 0:11:15| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=675)|
| 0:11:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=676)|
| 0:11:21| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=681)|
| 0:11:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=682)|
| 0:11:23| Seeing the picture of the deck addition on the back, and from this vantage point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=683)|
| 0:11:30| it looks like there's a railing around the entire perimeter of the deck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=690)|
| 0:11:35| so there's no way to get off that deck other than to jump over the railing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=695)|
| 0:11:40| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=700)|
| 0:11:41| There is one way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=701)|
| 0:11:43| There is a gate on the—I think it would be the north side of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=703)|
| 0:11:53| Is it ADA compliant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=713)|
| 0:11:57| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=717)|
| 0:11:59| No, the staff over here is saying no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=719)|
| 0:12:02| No, it is not ADA compliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=722)|
| 0:12:04| Would that be a requirement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=724)|
| 0:12:06| Most likely, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=726)|
| 0:12:13| Mr. Lindley, would you like to go through these pictures and explain what they're showing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=733)|
| 0:12:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=737)|
| 0:12:23| This is just a picture—oh, I'm sorry—of the front of the establishment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=743)|
| 0:12:30| and you can see that it has two levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=750)|
| 0:12:33| That upper gray area is the area that was supposed to be the storage area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=753)|
| 0:12:39| So we're looking at the front and the right side of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=759)|
| 0:12:45| Another shot of the front of the building and showing the front entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=765)|
| 0:12:50| Where the truck is parked on the left of the photo is where you can access the rear deck area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=770)|
| 0:12:59| You can access it from the ground level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=779)|
| 0:13:01| You can, but through a gate, through a drive gate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=781)|
| 0:13:06| And then up steps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=786)|
| 0:13:07| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=787)|
| 0:13:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=788)|
| 0:13:10| This photo is taken from the deck area looking back towards the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=790)|
| 0:13:16| If you can see my mouse circling, this was a stairs area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=796)|
| 0:13:21| Again, we did not inspect this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=801)|
| 0:13:24| This was not permitted, so everything here was done by the owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=804)|
| 0:13:29| after our inspector had given them their final inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=809)|
| 0:13:33| These tall pieces of equipment are the heaters that I was mentioning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=813)|
| 0:13:39| and they're propane heaters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=819)|
| 0:13:41| They are not anchored down, and then it's on a wooden deck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=821)|
| 0:13:44| so we have imminent hazards there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=824)|
| 0:13:50| I just took this—some issues I saw, extension cords running around the back of this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=830)|
| 0:13:57| I'm sure the deputy fire marshal will probably speak into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=837)|
| 0:14:02| This is just a picture of the whole deck itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=842)|
| 0:14:05| I tried to get it all in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=845)|
| 0:14:07| It's a large area and can tell me square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=847)|
| 0:14:12| but there are about seven of these propane heaters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=852)|
| 0:14:17| The deck doesn't appear to be that old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=857)|
| 0:14:20| You can see the wood looks fairly new and did not have a sealant on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=860)|
| 0:14:24| or didn't appear to have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=864)|
| 0:14:27| Again, another picture of the back of the building from the deck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=867)|
| 0:14:30| Did you get a picture of the doors that lead to the deck from the interior of the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=870)|
| 0:14:35| This is one of the doors here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=875)|
| 0:14:37| I placard all the exits with the orange placards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=877)|
| 0:14:40| so this is one door leading to the deck area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=880)|
| 0:14:45| From inside?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=885)|
| 0:14:46| No, this is on the exterior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=886)|
| 0:14:47| I know, but that door goes inside to the bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=889)|
| 0:14:51| What day did you placard the doors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=891)|
| 0:14:54| The 19th of December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=894)|
| 0:14:59| Before the deck was built, where did that door, how did it exit to the ground?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=899)|
| 0:15:06| There is a small three-by-three pad there of concrete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=906)|
| 0:15:12| When you came out the door, you would step on a little concrete pad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=912)|
| 0:15:17| Okay, so the deck is how high off the ground?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=917)|
| 0:15:23| Approximately a foot to two foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=923)|
| 0:15:25| Yes, that was in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=925)|
| 0:15:30| Mr. Chair, can I ask a question also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=930)|
| 0:15:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=932)|
| 0:15:33| On that picture before, go back one, those wires that are coming off of that outlet, go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=933)|
| 0:15:41| No, on up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=941)|
| 0:15:44| There is one that is right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=944)|
| 0:15:46| See right beside the door?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=946)|
| 0:15:52| Did anybody take a look to see what the size conduit was coming to that fixture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=952)|
| 0:15:56| and if that was big enough to hold?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=956)|
| 0:15:59| It looks like it's got two extension cords coming out of that one outlet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=959)|
| 0:16:06| Sure, although that's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=966)|
| 0:16:08| I don't have jurisdiction over the electrical in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=968)|
| 0:16:11| That's the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=971)|
| 0:16:13| I'm there to find imminent hazards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=973)|
| 0:16:16| Obvious in our issue was the fact they were using extension cords.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=976)|
| 0:16:20| As far as the loading of that fixture, that's not my jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=980)|
| 0:16:24| We don't know how much wattage or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=984)|
| 0:16:27| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=987)|
| 0:16:28| It appeared to be a 110.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=988)|
| 0:16:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=990)|
| 0:16:31| Can I ask a question on the other photo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=991)|
| 0:16:34| On the photo, it looks like there's an electrical line coming through the block wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=994)|
| 0:16:42| Is that correct or is it actually attached to the wall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1002)|
| 0:16:45| Go back down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1005)|
| 0:16:46| Maybe that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1006)|
| 0:16:47| Wait a minute, not that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1007)|
| 0:16:50| Okay, is that like a hole in a block wall and a wire is coming out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1010)|
| 0:16:54| and then they're hooking up an extension cord to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1014)|
| 0:16:59| I believe he had some ornamental lights above| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1019)|
| 0:17:02| and that white wire is dropping down to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1022)|
| 0:17:05| The owner may be able to address that more specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1025)|
| 0:17:09| But normally that would have to be encapsulated so water and things are not an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1029)|
| 0:17:13| so you don't have a shock hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| That is not outdoor rated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1035)|
| 0:17:16| There's several issues there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1036)|
| 0:17:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1037)|
| 0:17:19| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1039)|
| 0:17:20| Just a quick clarification question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1040)|
| 0:17:22| As we've seen the deck and the access to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1042)|
| 0:17:26| based on your observation for a patron to the establishment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1046)|
| 0:17:30| if they were going to be on the deck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1050)|
| 0:17:32| would their primary way be to go into the bar and then through that door to get to the deck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1052)|
| 0:17:36| or that other ramp that we saw to the front?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1056)|
| 0:17:40| If patrons, when they're coming into the bar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1060)|
| 0:17:42| if they would primarily be going straight to the deck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1062)|
| 0:17:44| or if access was primarily happening through the bar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1064)|
| 0:17:47| And the owner may want to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1067)|
| 0:17:53| When is your time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| Really, we would probably wait for the approved engineer design on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1075)|
| 0:18:02| because the way it is now, it's not configured to meet that, especially ADA compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1082)|
| 0:18:08| It's not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1088)|
| 0:18:09| It's not present at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1089)|
| 0:18:11| So there were so many issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1091)|
| 0:18:13| Our focal point was on the fact that we're trying just to shut it down to get him into compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1093)|
| 0:18:19| And we didn't drill down to specific issues at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1099)|
| 0:18:23| I did speak to Mr. Getty and told him anytime he needed me to come back, I would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1103)|
| 0:18:28| and we would walk through all this with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1108)|
| 0:18:31| So I guess our three primary major things are the occupancy upstairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1111)|
| 0:18:39| the deck itself is not permitted and has not had a stamp of an engineer or an architect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1119)|
| 0:18:45| and the doors at the rear do not meet egress for fire protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1125)|
| 0:18:51| And also the other hazards that were observed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1131)|
| 0:18:53| You saw the wiring and those kind of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1133)|
| 0:18:56| But you said that's a state thing that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1136)|
| 0:19:00| I mean, it's a problem, but you can't give him clarification on that or proof of discipline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1140)|
| 0:19:06| He was asking about a fixture loading question, and we don't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1146)|
| 0:19:12| I was talking about after the fixture having extension cords, and Travis could speak into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1152)|
| 0:19:18| It looked like there were several smaller things that needed to be dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1158)|
| 0:19:23| Like I said, I think the two big issues is the apartment upstairs and the deck out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1163)|
| 0:19:31| and the egress problems it's created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1171)|
| 0:19:33| And then as Mr. Bussler pointed out, the no permit for a kitchen to serve food from the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1173)|
| 0:19:42| Does anybody have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1182)|
| 0:19:47| Let me ask you this, Randy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1187)|
| 0:19:48| On those heaters, a lot of places use those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1188)|
| 0:19:52| Are there some kind of something that needs to be special about them to be able to use them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1192)|
| 0:19:57| Why don't you address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1197)|
| 0:19:59| Well, I'll be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1199)|
| 0:20:01| I wouldn't need to see the listing for that heater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1201)|
| 0:20:05| It will get specific and tell you if it can be used on something combustible or not used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1205)|
| 0:20:10| I have not seen the literature on that heater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1210)|
| 0:20:12| but it's something that I would definitely want to see before it would be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1212)|
| 0:20:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1216)|
| 0:20:19| Anything else from the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1219)|
| 0:20:25| Okay, I'll turn it back over to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1225)|
| 0:20:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1228)|
| 0:20:29| Thank you as far as the county's input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1229)|
| 0:20:32| At this time, I'd like to call Mr. Giddey up to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1232)|
| 0:20:41| Mr. Giddey, is the guy with you going to testify on your behalf in any way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1241)|
| 0:20:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1245)|
| 0:20:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1246)|
| 0:20:47| I need to get him sworn in at this time, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1247)|
| 0:20:50| If you would please raise your right hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1250)|
| 0:20:52| Do you solemnly swear and affirm that the testimony you're about to give to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1252)|
| 0:20:56| the Knox County Bureau Board, on these matters will be the truth, the whole truth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1256)|
| 0:21:00| and nothing but the truth, so help you God?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1260)|
| 0:21:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1262)|
| 0:21:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1263)|
| 0:21:04| Mr. Giddey, once again, I explained the procedures to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1264)|
| 0:21:07| Mr. Law Director, could I have his name, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1267)|
| 0:21:09| Timothy Threatt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1269)|
| 0:21:10| He's my general manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1270)|
| 0:21:12| Timothy Threatt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1272)|
| 0:21:13| Threatt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1273)|
| 0:21:14| Threatt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1274)|
| 0:21:15| Threatt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1275)|
| 0:21:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| I explained the procedures to you, Christopher, I think when you first came up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1277)|
| 0:21:25| and you've heard the allegations before you at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| and I'm going to ask you a global question, and you can break it down into pieces if you so desire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1289)|
| 0:21:35| Do you affirm or deny the violations that have been stated against you at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1295)|
| 0:21:40| I don't affirm to the living upstairs thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1300)|
| 0:21:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1307)|
| 0:21:48| So you do not affirm to the living, but you do affirm to the others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1308)|
| 0:21:52| Yes, sir, and I promise I'll fix whatever I need to fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1312)|
| 0:21:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1315)|
| 0:21:56| At this time, then, I will give you the opportunity to talk to this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1316)|
| 0:22:00| to tell them whatever it is you need, to explain your side of the story,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1320)|
| 0:22:05| and even to explain the non-affirming of the living upstairs when you have testimony to the contrary, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1325)|
| 0:22:13| And so I'll turn it over to you to give you some time to talk to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1333)|
| 0:22:17| and then at which time when you're through, then the chairman then will take over again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1337)|
| 0:22:21| and they can ask you whatever questions they desire, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1341)|
| 0:22:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1344)|
| 0:22:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| I'm a very new business owner, and I wasn't completely aware of all the rules and regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1347)|
| 0:22:33| I'm very sorry I did not obtain a permit for the deck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1353)|
| 0:22:40| I just was ignorant to the fact, and I promise I will fix anything and everything that's needed to be fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1360)|
| 0:22:47| I don't want my patrons to be in harm's way at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1367)|
| 0:22:50| I care very much for them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1370)|
| 0:22:53| I work very hard at what I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1373)|
| 0:22:55| It's my living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1375)|
| 0:22:56| It's how I make my living, so I really need to go back to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1376)|
| 0:23:01| and I promise, like I said, I'll take care of whatever I need to take care of, address any issues, fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1381)|
| 0:23:08| I don't know why my cook said what he said, but I allowed him to store stuff up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1388)|
| 0:23:15| No one was allowed up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| The reason I had a space heater up there was to keep the pipes from freezing and busting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1396)|
| 0:23:20| and flooding my building downstairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1400)|
| 0:23:27| The egress issues with the deck, I'm fairly certain that could be addressed pretty easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1407)|
| 0:23:34| There's 88 ramps on either side of the deck exiting the door and exiting the yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1414)|
| 0:23:42| If I need to put more, I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1422)|
| 0:23:44| I just need to find out exactly what all I need to do first, and I will take care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1424)|
| 0:23:54| Is there anything else you would like to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1434)|
| 0:23:57| Nothing at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1437)|
| 0:23:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1438)|
| 0:23:59| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1439)|
| 0:24:04| First, sir, I want to let you know that we're not trying to do anything against you out of spite or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1444)|
| 0:24:11| When something like this comes to our attention, we have to address it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1451)|
| 0:24:16| and in a sense we're kind of doing you a favor because if something were to happen there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1456)|
| 0:24:20| with these things being out of regulation, it would really open you up to a lawsuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1460)|
| 0:24:25| and you would be exposed to a lot of liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1465)|
| 0:24:29| Mr. Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1469)|
| 0:24:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1470)|
| 0:24:31| It looks like you made a significant investment in the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1471)|
| 0:24:35| so I don't know that I don't think you're a bad business guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1475)|
| 0:24:39| I think that you have done some things that should be common knowledge if you're doing business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1479)|
| 0:24:48| My question is, are you serving food there out of the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1488)|
| 0:24:52| Yes, we are, and we do have a permit for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1492)|
| 0:24:55| Our food score grade was 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1495)|
| 0:24:58| You have been inspected by the Health Department and you got 100?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1498)|
| 0:25:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1501)|
| 0:25:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1502)|
| 0:25:04| And another issue is when you built the deck, who built the deck for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1504)|
| 0:25:10| Just me and my friends helped me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1512)|
| 0:25:13| So you self-built the deck there on the back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1513)|
| 0:25:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1515)|
| 0:25:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1516)|
| 0:25:17| And you say it has ADA ramps on both sides of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1517)|
| 0:25:19| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1519)|
| 0:25:20| And who knew the regulations on ADA compliance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1520)|
| 0:25:24| I checked the ADA compliance online, so I'm pretty sure I got that covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1524)|
| 0:25:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1534)|
| 0:25:35| And the electrician?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1535)|
| 0:25:36| I mean, somebody has to sign off on the electricity that's out in the back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1536)|
| 0:25:44| and all that things, and you didn't think to have that inspected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1544)|
| 0:25:47| The electricity that the power cords were going to, the extension cords,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1547)|
| 0:25:52| that was preexisting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1552)|
| 0:25:55| I just ran it to have some light out there, and when I was out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1555)|
| 0:26:01| I hung up a shop light and ran the cord underneath the deck to the shop light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1561)|
| 0:26:07| How long has the deck been built?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1567)|
| 0:26:09| About three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1569)|
| 0:26:12| Three months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1574)|
| 0:26:15| And so you have no ADA compliance into the business from the inside to the outside?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1575)|
| 0:26:21| Because, I mean, obviously you've got stairs there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1581)|
| 0:26:24| You can come out the door here, and if you turn to the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1584)|
| 0:26:28| Step over to the mic so we can hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1588)|
| 0:26:29| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1589)|
| 0:26:30| If you come out the back door, he's showing there, and you turn to your right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1590)|
| 0:26:33| there's a ramp that goes up there that you can get up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1593)|
| 0:26:36| On the far end, there's a gate there that's always left unlocked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1596)|
| 0:26:40| and you can go up a ramp there if need be for wheelchairs, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1600)|
| 0:26:44| How wide are those ramps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1604)|
| 0:26:45| They don't look very wide in the pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1605)|
| 0:26:47| I'd say at least three foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1607)|
| 0:26:49| Four feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1609)|
| 0:26:50| Four feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1610)|
| 0:26:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1612)|
| 0:26:53| Mr. Early?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1613)|
| 0:26:54| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1614)|
| 0:26:55| They did have a ramp, and I didn't put a tape on it just walking up it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1615)|
| 0:27:01| It didn't have the proper ratio of the slope that is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1621)|
| 0:27:04| They did attempt to put a ramp, and it doesn't meet the ADA requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1624)|
| 0:27:10| which they probably didn't have access to all those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1630)|
| 0:27:13| But they did attempt to build one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| What would it take to get them in compliance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1636)|
| 0:27:19| Not a whole lot, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1639)|
| 0:27:23| You need an architect, and he's going to need to do a design on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| and get with us in the fire bureau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1646)|
| 0:27:31| The biggest thing is going to be the egress off the deck, would you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1651)|
| 0:27:36| The sprinkler requirement for the apartment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1656)|
| 0:27:39| What if he doesn't use it as an apartment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1659)|
| 0:27:43| Put your mic down, Travis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| I've got signed statements in here that it will not be used as an apartment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1665)|
| 0:27:50| and they go back to 2010 before they took over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1670)|
| 0:27:54| And, you know, we've had this apartment issue since 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1674)|
| 0:27:58| But they, Mr. Freak, signed a letter saying that no one would be staying up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1678)|
| 0:28:04| But after talking with him on the phone, not only did Justin, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1684)|
| 0:28:10| Justin said it to the investigators, and I can read this in the report to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1690)|
| 0:28:15| But you also went up there and slept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1695)|
| 0:28:18| Well, I never slept up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1698)|
| 0:28:20| I just went up there to rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1702)|
| 0:28:27| Is there a bed in the restaurant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| There's a mattress, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1709)|
| 0:28:31| There was a mattress sitting on the floor there, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1711)|
| 0:28:34| In the apartment upstairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| Can I read this to you out of the investigator's report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1716)|
| 0:28:40| It says an interview was conducted with Justin Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| The cook could discover the fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1722)|
| 0:28:44| He accompanied investigators upstairs to help identify any items of interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1724)|
| 0:28:48| and describe his actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1728)|
| 0:28:50| He described the area where he saw the fire as the same area where the main fire damage was now visible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1730)|
| 0:28:56| He stated that he had slept in a bed adjacent to the fire the prior night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1736)|
| 0:29:00| and that he does this on occasion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| He stated he uses the quartz heater at times and believes he used it the prior night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1742)|
| 0:29:08| He originally stated he was very sure he had turned the heater off the prior morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1748)|
| 0:29:14| He later stated that he thought about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1754)|
| 0:29:16| He had maybe left it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| The heater was too damaged to determine the position of the switches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1758)|
| 0:29:23| And that's the interview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1763)|
| 0:29:28| The apartment is not habitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| There's no stove, no refrigerator, no bathtub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1770)|
| 0:29:34| I mean, there was a sink and a commode is all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1774)|
| 0:29:37| A hand sink and a commode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1777)|
| 0:29:39| Do you have a stove and a refrigerator downstairs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1779)|
| 0:29:44| Downstairs for the restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| Fairly uninhabitable then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1786)|
| 0:29:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1787)|
| 0:29:48| There's nothing in the apartment to say it's habitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1788)|
| 0:29:52| Can you sleep there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1792)|
| 0:29:56| I wouldn't want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1796)|
| 0:29:57| There's no central heat and air upstairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1797)|
| 0:29:59| and that's why I had the quartz heater upstairs to keep the pipes from freezing and busting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1799)|
| 0:30:05| It's not a habitable spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| I mean, habitability is a matter of an opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1808)|
| 0:30:12| Anywhere you can lay your head, you can usually call that a habitat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1812)|
| 0:30:20| Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| There was two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1822)|
| 0:30:23| I've already said something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1823)|
| 0:30:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1824)|
| 0:30:25| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1825)|
| 0:30:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| Mr. Getty, you had a notice of non-occupancy, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1828)|
| 0:30:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1833)|
| 0:30:34| And you violated that several times?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1834)|
| 0:30:38| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1838)|
| 0:30:40| When?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1840)|
| 0:30:41| I was given a certificate of occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1841)|
| 0:30:46| A non-occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1846)|
| 0:30:47| A non-occupancy the day that I closed the doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1847)|
| 0:30:50| I didn't have any prior notice to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| When was this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1853)|
| 0:30:54| When did you receive that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1854)|
| 0:30:55| The 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1855)|
| 0:30:56| So you were not open days the 21st?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1856)|
| 0:31:01| You were open Monday, which was the 19th, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1861)|
| 0:31:05| Yeah, I was open when they delivered the removal of certificate of occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1865)|
| 0:31:10| Were you open on Tuesday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1870)|
| 0:31:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1871)|
| 0:31:12| Wednesday, Thursday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1872)|
| 0:31:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1873)|
| 0:31:14| Or today's Thursday, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| Is that correct, Randy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1877)|
| 0:31:19| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1879)|
| 0:31:20| I did not deliver this to him until Tuesday at 3 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1880)|
| 0:31:25| But he was open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1885)|
| 0:31:26| He was open part of that, but part of that he had no knowledge of what was about to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1886)|
| 0:31:32| So I did send staff out there both days, and he has been in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1892)|
| 0:31:37| It has been closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| And someone just went out there two hours ago and checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1900)|
| 0:31:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1905)|
| 0:31:46| Commissioner Gale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1906)|
| 0:31:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1907)|
| 0:31:48| How long have you owned this business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| Approximately a year and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1910)|
| 0:31:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1913)|
| 0:31:56| Commissioner Carringer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1916)|
| 0:31:58| This is a question for all of our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1918)|
| 0:32:02| In order for him to continue business only with inside the original bar that we okayed his beer permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1922)|
| 0:32:17| with not using any of the deck or the upstairs storage and all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1937)|
| 0:32:23| what would it take for him to be in compliance with what we originally gave him his beer permit for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1943)|
| 0:32:36| Commissioner, may I state this a different way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1956)|
| 0:32:39| Are you asking how could he be open right now and be in compliance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1959)|
| 0:32:45| We would have to have all the exits to that deck area chained and padlocked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1965)|
| 0:32:50| and the fence around it, all other egresses to that area padlocked unless you said differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1970)|
| 0:33:01| That door leading out to that deck, that is a required means of egress, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1981)|
| 0:33:05| It was labeled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1985)|
| 0:33:07| I didn't go through the one on the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1987)|
| 0:33:10| Yeah, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1990)|
| 0:33:12| There is no way you could be in compliance without going on that deck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1992)|
| 0:33:16| That deck needs to be, we need a design professional to look at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=1996)|
| 0:33:21| and we need to review it and go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2001)|
| 0:33:24| Okay, that was my question as to what he would need to do in order to be in business again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2004)|
| 0:33:34| if they weren't using the deck or any of that, just the original structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2014)|
| 0:33:41| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| Commissioner Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| A quick question, I guess, for codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2027)|
| 0:33:50| Does that door on the back have to be in and out in the sense of the way it moves?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2030)|
| 0:33:54| It only goes out, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2034)|
| 0:33:56| You're talking about the swing of the door?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| Yes, sir, the one marked for egress, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| And that's okay or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2040)|
| 0:34:03| I didn't look at it real close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2043)|
| 0:34:04| It was okay at the time that it was permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2044)|
| 0:34:08| I believe it was in compliance, but I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2048)|
| 0:34:11| Again, we didn't get specifics on our inspection on Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2051)|
| 0:34:16| And I, again, told the owner I would be glad to come out and go over everything with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2056)|
| 0:34:21| Okay, and then since we're talking about this and we seem to be going around in circles on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2061)|
| 0:34:27| if you have a business and you have a place upstairs like this one has that has a bed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2067)|
| 0:34:35| whether it has a kitchen or whatever, but it has a sink and it has a commode there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2075)|
| 0:34:44| that's okay to have if nobody stays there or it's not allowed or it has to be permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2084)|
| 0:34:50| or exactly what are the rules going to be there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2090)|
| 0:34:55| If that upstairs is classified by the design professional as an R occupancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2095)|
| 0:35:01| which the R stands for residential and there's subcategories of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2101)|
| 0:35:05| all R occupancies by the building code and the fire code are required to be sprinkled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2105)|
| 0:35:11| and that is throughout the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2111)|
| 0:35:15| So, but if he has a bed up there and says nobody uses it, I'm just saying, that's okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2115)|
| 0:35:23| That's what we've been dealing with since 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| Got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2125)|
| 0:35:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2126)|
| 0:35:27| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2127)|
| 0:35:32| Mr. Besseler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2132)|
| 0:35:33| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2133)|
| 0:35:36| Mr. Kitty, you said that you got a hundred on a report about your kitchen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2136)|
| 0:35:43| saying you've been cooking there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2143)|
| 0:35:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| Health Department, I've got a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2147)|
| 0:35:50| As I asked you before, has that been permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2150)|
| 0:35:54| and how could he get a hundred on a report when he's not allowed to cook there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2154)|
| 0:36:00| I spoke to the inspector who inspects this facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2160)|
| 0:36:06| and I was told that there is not a permit for the kitchen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2166)|
| 0:36:10| It's only a permit for the bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2170)|
| 0:36:12| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2172)|
| 0:36:13| And an inspection was done on the bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2173)|
| 0:36:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2177)|
| 0:36:18| There's not a permit for the kitchen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| and my director of environmental health also agreed with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2180)|
| 0:36:25| There's no permit for the kitchen, but it's only a permit for the bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2185)|
| 0:36:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2190)|
| 0:36:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2191)|
| 0:36:32| Do you understand that, Mr. Kitty?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2192)|
| 0:36:36| I paid the $360 for the permit, and it's hanging on the wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2196)|
| 0:36:42| I'm not really sure what I've not done there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2202)|
| 0:36:48| I'm confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| I will get back with the inspector and my director on that permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2210)|
| 0:36:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2214)|
| 0:36:55| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| Commissioner Skinbreaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2217)|
| 0:36:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2219)|
| 0:37:00| You kind of stole my thunder there, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| but I wanted to ask the general manager a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2222)|
| 0:37:07| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2227)|
| 0:37:08| Back to the food service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2228)|
| 0:37:11| Have you managed a bar or a restaurant in the past?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2231)|
| 0:37:16| I've owned five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2238)|
| 0:37:19| So are you familiar with a health department requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2239)|
| 0:37:24| for a certificate for the bar and one for a restaurant or food service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2244)|
| 0:37:30| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2250)|
| 0:37:31| All of the restaurants and bar areas that I've had, they was all together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2251)|
| 0:37:35| Of course, I had to have a beer license to serve beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2255)|
| 0:37:39| but when they would come and inspect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| it was the same person that came and inspect the kitchen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2261)|
| 0:37:44| as was the dining room as was the bar area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2264)|
| 0:37:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2267)|
| 0:37:48| Were you present when the last inspection was made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2270)|
| 0:37:51| I was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| I guess really where we're at is you don't have a certificate of occupancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2275)|
| 0:38:00| and the law states to have a beer permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2280)|
| 0:38:02| you've got to have a certificate of occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2282)|
| 0:38:05| And Mr. Law Director, check this if it's a proper motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2285)|
| 0:38:09| Instead of suspending or revoking, and I don't know if there's a suspension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2289)|
| 0:38:14| or whatever, I'm trying to keep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2294)|
| 0:38:17| could we make a motion that he has the option to surrender his beer permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2297)|
| 0:38:24| until such time as he gets a CO without there not being a suspension on there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2304)|
| 0:38:30| and you've still got to surrender your beer permit just for our liability's sake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2310)|
| 0:38:35| So I'd like to make the motion that the owner has the option, if agreed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2315)|
| 0:38:38| to surrender his beer permit until an appropriate certificate of occupancy can be given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2318)|
| 0:38:44| What about the other issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2324)|
| 0:38:46| I mean, all of them will come with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| Health and any inspection necessary to obtain a beer permit be brought into compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2328)|
| 0:38:55| He surrenders it voluntarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| And that keeps the suspension off your record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| but you've got to be a smarter guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2340)|
| 0:39:05| You said some things that lead me to believe you're smarter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2345)|
| 0:39:08| than you're trying to play off on that permitting stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2348)|
| 0:39:12| You were smart enough to look up ADA, but you didn't know you needed a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2352)|
| 0:39:15| Those are two different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2355)|
| 0:39:18| But I'm giving you the opportunity, if you agree, to surrender your permit until OC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2358)|
| 0:39:23| That's up to the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2365)|
| 0:39:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2366)|
| 0:39:29| Mr. Law Director, that was a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2369)|
| 0:39:31| Is that a proper motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2371)|
| 0:39:33| The owner of a beer permit can surrender a beer permit any time they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2373)|
| 0:39:38| And if this board, they're requesting that he do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2378)|
| 0:39:44| and theoretically once he gets his building back into compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2384)|
| 0:39:48| he can come back and apply for a new beer permit is what I'm hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2388)|
| 0:39:53| And all of the health and codes and fire marshal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2393)|
| 0:39:58| and the Sheriff's Department will have their final inspections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2398)|
| 0:40:01| just like we always do for any other building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| And all the I's should be dotted and T's crossed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2404)|
| 0:40:08| all the issues that you all are talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2408)|
| 0:40:11| So if the owner is willing to basically make a contractual agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2411)|
| 0:40:16| with this board to surrender his permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2416)|
| 0:40:20| and would execute that voluntarily, you can voluntarily turn it over to our chief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2420)|
| 0:40:26| then I could see that that would be a settlement agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2426)|
| 0:40:30| Mr. Law Director, I interpreted the question asked by my fellow Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2430)|
| 0:40:34| to be somewhat worded a little differently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2434)|
| 0:40:37| and that we frequently issue permits pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2437)|
| 0:40:43| And I think I hear him asking the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2443)|
| 0:40:47| as can we assume there will be no beer sales there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2447)|
| 0:40:52| until he has satisfied the pending items that are listed as his noncompliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2452)|
| 0:40:58| Well, then you're really talking about a suspension of the license until he becomes in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2458)|
| 0:41:06| Let me expand just another word or two maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2466)|
| 0:41:14| We are not asking him to go comply with something and come back and reapply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2474)|
| 0:41:20| That's the way I heard the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| Mine was similar to meeting the pendings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2482)|
| 0:41:25| You all have the power to settle this judiciary action any way you want to under the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2485)|
| 0:41:34| which you can suspend, you can revoke, you can fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2494)|
| 0:41:37| The fining aspect of it could be a settlement agreement in any way you wanted to address it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2497)|
| 0:41:46| if you get what I'm trying to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| If this board comes into a settlement legal agreement with this particular person in violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2508)|
| 0:41:54| and you set up certain conditions that can be met and then he can go back into operation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2514)|
| 0:42:00| then that's entirely up to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2520)|
| 0:42:05| As I think I'm getting agreement from my fellow Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2525)|
| 0:42:10| his motion's intent is that there will be no beer sales at this location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2530)|
| 0:42:19| until such time as the applicant, the holder of the license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2539)|
| 0:42:26| has satisfied all the requirements of the four entities in Knox County that are seated here before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2546)|
| 0:42:33| If that's the way this board votes and wants it to be done, it can be done that way, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2553)|
| 0:42:38| But he's not surrendering a license under that condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2558)|
| 0:42:41| You're making a legal settlement under that condition and he has to comport to those conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2561)|
| 0:42:48| and he would be subject to Chief May or whoever to go and code, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2568)|
| 0:42:54| the county working with him and monitoring those conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2574)|
| 0:42:57| As long as they weren't violated, then that's the penalty that you all have unpublished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2577)|
| 0:43:03| And I now observe Mr. Getty and I ask the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2583)|
| 0:43:09| there will be no beer sales at this location until such time as you have satisfied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2589)|
| 0:43:15| the four entities of Knox County here as to whether or not you are in compliance with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2595)|
| 0:43:23| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2603)|
| 0:43:24| No beer sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2604)|
| 0:43:25| No beer sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2605)|
| 0:43:26| No beer sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2606)|
| 0:43:27| My fellow Commissioner, Mr. Anders, is that the way you've made your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2607)|
| 0:43:32| Yeah, my intent was to allow him, once he met compliance, to re-present his beer license to him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2612)|
| 0:43:39| us to hold him so he couldn't order beer or sell beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2619)|
| 0:43:44| Therefore, you're asking him to let the beer board have custody of the license until he complies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2624)|
| 0:43:52| at which time he would come back before this board and give testimony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2632)|
| 0:43:56| and witness from the county, if you will, where the county would release him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2636)|
| 0:44:01| and we would return the custody of his license to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2641)|
| 0:44:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2644)|
| 0:44:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2645)|
| 0:44:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2646)|
| 0:44:07| So to follow with that understanding of my fellow Commissioner's motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2647)|
| 0:44:15| then I would second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2655)|
| 0:44:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2657)|
| 0:44:18| So then, in other words, he would appear back before us on January the 22nd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2658)|
| 0:44:24| which is the next scheduled beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2664)|
| 0:44:27| If he's in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2667)|
| 0:44:28| If he's in compliance, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2668)|
| 0:44:30| And the advantage to him, as opposed to giving him, which is 30 days out from now, a 30-day suspension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2670)|
| 0:44:38| that would be more critical as far as on his license that he had a 30- or a 60- or a 90-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2678)|
| 0:44:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2686)|
| 0:44:47| So right now, he would surrender his license until January 22nd, 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2687)|
| 0:44:55| Or he comes into compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| Yeah, but if he comes into compliance, we still have to meet formally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2697)|
| 0:45:01| so we can hear from all the different entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| Longer than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2703)|
| 0:45:04| Oh, correct, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2704)|
| 0:45:05| Not prior to January 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| Got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2707)|
| 0:45:13| Commissioner Gale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2713)|
| 0:45:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2714)|
| 0:45:15| Could we enter the language of voluntary compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2715)|
| 0:45:18| and can we list the departments specific that he has to make sure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2718)|
| 0:45:23| Because in the original motion, they are not listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2723)|
| 0:45:26| I think in order to get the CO, you have to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2726)|
| 0:45:32| Yeah, my statement was that he'd have to comply with all regulations was in my statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2732)|
| 0:45:39| Does that work for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2739)|
| 0:45:40| Health department, sheriff's office, all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2740)|
| 0:45:43| You may not be aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2743)|
| 0:45:48| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2750)|
| 0:45:51| Travis, how are you going to know that this upstairs is not going to be used as a department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2751)|
| 0:45:57| They can stand there and say it's not going to be used as a living quarters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2757)|
| 0:46:01| How would you or we know that unless you go out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| and do a surprise inspection at any time of the day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2764)|
| 0:46:10| When we approved it, when the license changed hands back into June of this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2770)|
| 0:46:16| we got a letter stating that they would not occupy that and got them to write that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2776)|
| 0:46:23| In the past, that's really the only thing we could get from them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2783)|
| 0:46:27| is just an acknowledgment that they would not use it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| But it has not worked well for us, and that's just being honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2790)|
| 0:46:34| Yeah, and they're in violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2794)|
| 0:46:36| I'm trying to make an agreement to kind of wipe it away or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2796)|
| 0:46:40| Wolfie, is any police, sheriff's department being called out any time in the past six months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2800)|
| 0:46:46| Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2806)|
| 0:46:47| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2807)|
| 0:46:48| Mr. Getty?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2810)|
| 0:46:51| Have you had any trouble out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2811)|
| 0:46:52| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2812)|
| 0:46:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2813)|
| 0:46:56| Wolfie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2816)|
| 0:46:58| I did a walkthrough back in June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| and, of course, I'm looking for liquor, moonshine, drugs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2821)|
| 0:47:06| and he was very friendly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2826)|
| 0:47:12| and I actually walked through, looked behind the bar, everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2832)|
| 0:47:18| Everything was okay as far as my part went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2838)|
| 0:47:23| Commissioner Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2845)|
| 0:47:28| I just want to make sure that he understands that even if you got all hands on deck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2848)|
| 0:47:32| and you went out there for the next seven days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| and you had everybody and their grandmother working on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2854)|
| 0:47:37| you could not do anything until you come back before this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2857)|
| 0:47:40| Okay, just make sure you're clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| And still, I hate to keep wearing out this fire department thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2862)|
| 0:47:46| but is it okay to sleep up there during the day when they're open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2866)|
| 0:47:50| It's not at any time, even if they're open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2870)|
| 0:47:54| I'm going to go rest for an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2874)|
| 0:47:56| That's not okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2876)|
| 0:47:57| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2877)|
| 0:47:58| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2878)|
| 0:47:59| Now I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2879)|
| 0:48:00| Health Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2880)|
| 0:48:01| Correction, I just spoke with the inspector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2881)|
| 0:48:04| They do have a permit to cook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2884)|
| 0:48:07| but the KUB has shut down the kitchen because of the grease trap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2887)|
| 0:48:16| This is what I'm told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2896)|
| 0:48:18| They do have a permit, but they cannot operate the kitchen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2898)|
| 0:48:23| because KUB has shut down the kitchen because of a grease receptor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2903)|
| 0:48:30| They do not have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2910)|
| 0:48:36| If you have to change locations, you'll have to start this whole process all over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2916)|
| 0:48:39| I'm just letting you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2919)|
| 0:48:52| One point, back to the apartment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2932)|
| 0:48:54| You may want to get rid of that mattress that's up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2934)|
| 0:48:59| Mattress is gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2939)|
| 0:49:00| Everything's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| My point is perception can be reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2942)|
| 0:49:04| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2944)|
| 0:49:05| I may have said that with a little humor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2945)|
| 0:49:07| but it's the perception with our inspectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2947)|
| 0:49:12| Before you took over and moved in there, that was an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2952)|
| 0:49:16| Who knows, that mattress could have predated you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2956)|
| 0:49:19| Either way, it's probably very nasty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2959)|
| 0:49:21| but you need to get rid of the mattress to avoid the temptation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2961)|
| 0:49:27| I would suggest instead of using a space heater to try to keep your pipes from freezing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2967)|
| 0:49:31| getting some insulation over the pipes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2971)|
| 0:49:37| Just a quick question then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2977)|
| 0:49:39| My understanding then from the health department that they're shut down food-wise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2979)|
| 0:49:44| and pending action today, they'll be shut down beer-wise until January 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2984)|
| 0:49:49| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2989)|
| 0:49:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2990)|
| 0:49:51| And they had been notified by KUB that they could not use the kitchen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2991)|
| 0:49:56| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2996)|
| 0:49:57| I was told that the kitchen was shut down by KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=2997)|
| 0:50:00| They cannot use the kitchen because of the grease receptor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3000)|
| 0:50:03| They do not have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3003)|
| 0:50:05| Do you know when that was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3005)|
| 0:50:06| No, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| I'll have to get with the inspector and get the dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3008)|
| 0:50:12| Were you guys aware of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3012)|
| 0:50:14| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3014)|
| 0:50:16| I'm on a septic system out in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3016)|
| 0:50:18| and I'm not aware that I have to have a grease trap for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3018)|
| 0:50:26| I've got one, but I just don't know that I need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3026)|
| 0:50:33| KUB has the rules for the regulations for grease receptors, and we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3033)|
| 0:50:41| We tell them that they need one, but KUB rules over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3041)|
| 0:50:47| Okay, so we don't know if you need one or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3047)|
| 0:50:48| We don't have authority for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3048)|
| 0:50:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3051)|
| 0:50:53| Commissioner Downs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3053)|
| 0:50:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3058)|
| 0:50:59| So did you say you're on septic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3059)|
| 0:51:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3062)|
| 0:51:03| So KUB has nothing over septic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3063)|
| 0:51:06| but they overrule his septic service without having any sanitary sewer there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3066)|
| 0:51:12| and even though you gave them a permit, KUB says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3072)|
| 0:51:17| no, you can't do it because you have no grease trap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3077)|
| 0:51:21| Well, in the city, KUB has gone around city-wise to look at grease receptors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3081)|
| 0:51:30| If they need to improve the grease receptors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3090)|
| 0:51:35| they have to go by their rules, their regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3095)|
| 0:51:38| This is county now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3098)|
| 0:51:39| We're talking about county also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3099)|
| 0:51:41| Yes, but I am told by the inspector, and this is Mr. Jerry Hurst,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3101)|
| 0:51:45| that's who inspects this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3105)|
| 0:51:48| I just called him, and he said that KUB shut down the kitchen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3108)|
| 0:51:53| because of the grease receptor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3113)|
| 0:51:57| I'll have to get more information reports on that to let you know more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3117)|
| 0:52:04| but I am told that KUB shut down the kitchen because of the grease receptor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3124)|
| 0:52:10| Now, they do have a permit to operate food, but according to KUB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3130)|
| 0:52:15| this is what I'm told by the inspector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3135)|
| 0:52:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3138)|
| 0:52:19| Totally confusing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3139)|
| 0:52:22| We're in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3142)|
| 0:52:23| You said the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3143)|
| 0:52:24| Is the same rules apply in the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3144)|
| 0:52:27| If KUB gets involved, yes, they determine what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3147)|
| 0:52:33| That's out of our preview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3153)|
| 0:52:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3155)|
| 0:52:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| Could the motion be restated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3158)|
| 0:52:40| To what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| Make a motion that upon owner's agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3162)|
| 0:52:49| and surrendering their license until he becomes in compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3169)|
| 0:52:52| and appears before the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3172)|
| 0:52:58| Until he gets in compliance, at least January 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3178)|
| 0:53:03| And comes before the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3185)|
| 0:53:08| And you have to agree to that as well before we vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3188)|
| 0:53:12| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3192)|
| 0:53:13| You agree to that, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3193)|
| 0:53:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3194)|
| 0:53:16| So, Mr. Law Director, just so that he doesn't walk out of here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3196)|
| 0:53:21| and say, well, I didn't know that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3201)|
| 0:53:24| does he need to give you a certain notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3204)|
| 0:53:27| before he appears back before the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3207)|
| 0:53:31| I think when he gets all the permitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3211)|
| 0:53:35| and he gets his CO from Randy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3215)|
| 0:53:38| then at that time the county can tell him he is eligible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3218)|
| 0:53:41| to come and get his beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3221)|
| 0:53:44| At that time he will need to contact Sandra and get him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3224)|
| 0:53:48| I started to say get him on the docket,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3228)|
| 0:53:50| get him on the beer docket where you can come and show proof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3230)|
| 0:53:55| Of course, these people will be here to support you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3235)|
| 0:53:58| and show proof of your compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| at which time Chief May then would be eligible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3240)|
| 0:54:04| upon vote of this board to return you your permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3244)|
| 0:54:09| But he can do that the day before beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3249)|
| 0:54:13| The beer board has a deadline for the agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3253)|
| 0:54:17| That's what I'm looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3257)|
| 0:54:19| It makes no difference to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| but I was going to say perhaps we should put him on there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3261)|
| 0:54:25| and if he's not ready then it can be deferred to February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3265)|
| 0:54:29| That's what I was going to suggest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3269)|
| 0:54:32| Go ahead and apply to be in January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3272)|
| 0:54:34| and if you're not finished we'll just postpone another month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3274)|
| 0:54:37| to give you more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3277)|
| 0:54:41| Just a point of clarification too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3281)|
| 0:54:44| because he doesn't physically have the beer license on his person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3284)|
| 0:54:48| does Captain Mays follow him back to the facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3288)|
| 0:54:52| and pick it up this afternoon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3292)|
| 0:54:54| Yeah, Chief Mays has a total understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3294)|
| 0:54:56| of how to execute this order from this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3296)|
| 0:55:00| as it relates to his voluntary surrender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3300)|
| 0:55:02| So I think the Chief will have the permit in his custody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3302)|
| 0:55:06| probably before the end of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3306)|
| 0:55:08| And all of the beer vendors will be notified, etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3308)|
| 0:55:11| You'll go through your normal procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3311)|
| 0:55:13| Is that not correct, Chief?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3313)|
| 0:55:14| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3314)|
| 0:55:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3315)|
| 0:55:16| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3316)|
| 0:55:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3317)|
| 0:55:18| Mr. Lilly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3318)|
| 0:55:19| The deck is not in compliance, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3319)|
| 0:55:22| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3322)|
| 0:55:23| And he will have to go get a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3323)|
| 0:55:25| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3325)|
| 0:55:26| He built it without the permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3326)|
| 0:55:27| so if he wants to keep the deck without tearing it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3327)|
| 0:55:30| he'll have to go before BZA to ask for a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3330)|
| 0:55:33| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3333)|
| 0:55:34| Not necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3334)|
| 0:55:37| We didn't check setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3337)|
| 0:55:38| That is a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| So if that is a possibility and it does happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3340)|
| 0:55:43| that'll be the fourth Wednesday of January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3343)|
| 0:55:47| and time goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3347)|
| 0:55:48| We're going dates that might not be reasonable to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom171221SpecialCalledBeerBoard?start=3348)|
