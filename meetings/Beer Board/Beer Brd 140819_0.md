| 0:02:20| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=140)|
| 0:02:22| Mr. McClamrock, would you like to tell us about your event, upcoming event?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=142)|

| 0:06:05| Good evening. Curtis Isabel with Tobacco More Inc. The location is 3325 Middlebrook Pike. Knoxville. And this is Ms. Gava.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=365)|
| 0:06:25| Good evening. This is Deepika Sharma here. And my address is 3325 Middlebrook Pike, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=385)|
| 0:06:34| Okay. Thank you very much. Sergeant Hunter. The owner did not disclose on the application a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=394)|
| 0:06:39| conviction for 4-34 C signs required in city court and answered no to questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=399)|
| 0:06:45| 7 and 9 on the application. Mr. Frost, you want to weigh in on this? Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=405)|
| 0:06:52| Chairman. Briefly, members of the beer board, when you have a permit you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=412)|
| 0:06:59| supposed to have displayed certain signs concerning, you know, underage sales and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=419)|
| 0:07:04| things like that. That is grounds to deny a beer permit. In the past, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=424)|
| 0:07:13| maybe one if not two occasions, the beer board has allowed a person to postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=433)|
| 0:07:20| their application where they have the opportunity to go back to court and ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=440)|
| 0:07:26| that the matter get reopened. Many people don't realize the gravity of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=446)|
| 0:07:32| situation and they just simply come in, they pay the fine, which is an admission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=452)|
| 0:07:37| of guilt, and had they known that if they'd come to court, explain the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=457)|
| 0:07:42| circumstances that there is the possibility that the judge might fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=462)|
| 0:07:47| them and put them on probation or diversion for a period of time where it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=467)|
| 0:07:51| would go away, then it would not count as a violation, which would then prevent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=471)|
| 0:07:57| them from obtaining a beer permit. Let me go ahead and one second. Ms. Dyer, do you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=477)|
| 0:08:05| have information? Yes, we still lack the sales tax registration, the certificate of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=485)|
| 0:08:10| donning from MPC, the building inspection approvals, fire prevention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=490)|
| 0:08:14| approvals, and the former owner permit. Okay, Councilman Grieve? I just had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=494)|
| 0:08:19| question to Mr. Frost. Does that pertain to question number nine, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=499)|
| 0:08:27| List the names of the managers? It says answered no to question number nine. Have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=507)|
| 0:08:33| you ever been convicted of any misdemeanor, speeding, DUI, simple assault| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=513)|
| 0:08:36| within the last ten years? Yeah, I'm sorry, it was a different number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=516)|
| 0:08:40| number nine that I was looking at. It was the number nine for the application for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=520)|
| 0:08:44| beer permit, but... There's two questions here, seven and nine. I think you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=524)|
| 0:08:49| addressed seven, right? Right, well, that would apply because, you know, like I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=529)|
| 0:08:53| said, not many people think, you know, a sign falling down or a sign accidentally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=533)|
| 0:08:57| not getting up would be some sort of violation such as that. What have we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=537)|
| 0:09:05| done in the past, though, about someone not answering question number nine? Well, in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=545)|
| 0:09:10| this circumstance, in the past, I believe the person was allowed to postpone their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=550)|
| 0:09:16| application, and then they went to city court and asked that the matter be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=556)|
| 0:09:22| reopened, and then upon successful completion of whatever the judge did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=562)|
| 0:09:29| then those people came back, then it did not count as a violation, and they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=569)|
| 0:09:37| able to get their beer permit. She's got representation here with all due| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=577)|
| 0:09:43| respect. Let's go ahead and hear from you, and then that, you know, we'll hear from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=583)|
| 0:09:48| the council members. The answer on that question was just an oversight on my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=588)|
| 0:09:53| client's part. I mean, they did go to court, and after they recited, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=593)|
| 0:09:58| had the signs, have had the signs up since that time. If the board would allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=598)|
| 0:10:03| us the opportunity to do what Mr. Frost has suggested, we'll certainly do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=603)|
| 0:10:07| that. Okay. Councilman Mayor Brown. Councilman Wallace. Well, I just wanted to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=607)|
| 0:10:16| what, tell, what are we, what is it we're, y'all are trying to do? You're changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=616)|
| 0:10:21| owners? Is that what we're doing? No, we're, they're actually adding another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=621)|
| 0:10:26| location. They're buying an existing business and trying to get a beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=626)|
| 0:10:30| permit at that existing business. The violation that they've been talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=630)|
| 0:10:34| about is that the current, the current location, but they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=634)|
| 0:10:42| buying another location, and they're going to have two locations in essence. And the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=642)|
| 0:10:48| name of the business is what? Tobacco and More, Inc. Okay, so the name of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=648)|
| 0:10:52| business name at the top of this application says Middlebrook Discount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=652)|
| 0:10:55| Tobacco. That's not it? I'm sorry, I misunderstood your question. Yes, at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=655)|
| 0:10:59| location they're trying to get the permit for, it is Middlebrook Discount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=659)|
| 0:11:02| Tobacco. Tobacco and More, Inc. is the corporation that's operating. So Middlebrook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=662)|
| 0:11:06| Discount Tobacco surrendering their permit. That's what I'm trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=666)|
| 0:11:11| understand. What are you trying to, are you all the same owner? You're just taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=671)|
| 0:11:14| the same name, or you bought the, I don't understand what you're trying to do. We're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=674)|
| 0:11:17| buying the building. We're not going to change the sign on the front of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=677)|
| 0:11:19| business that says Middlebrook Discount. They're purchasing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=679)|
| 0:11:23| business from the current owners. Okay, all right, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=683)|
| 0:11:30| Okay, Mayor Brown. I just want to, Mr. Frost, when you were talking about number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=690)|
| 0:11:34| seven, what were you on, which page were you on now? I believe that's the beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=694)|
| 0:11:42| permit owner hyphen manager application. The question was number seven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=702)|
| 0:11:48| have you ever been convicted of any violation of any liquor and or beer laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=708)|
| 0:11:52| felonies, or any other crime involving moral perpetuity within the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=712)|
| 0:11:57| ten years, or do you have any charges currently pending? And the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=717)|
| 0:12:01| checked, no. Well, that beer sign issue is a beer law issue. So that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=721)|
| 0:12:15| the holdup for this applicant. All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=735)|
| 0:12:20| I'd like to make a motion we postpone until things are in the proper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=740)|
| 0:12:25| order, according to what Mr. Frost has to say. For the next beer board meeting, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=745)|
| 0:12:30| believe it's September 16th. I don't know if they can get everything. I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=750)|
| 0:12:34| quite clear in my mind what has to be done, but I think that this has to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=754)|
| 0:12:38| done correctly. Whether it's the next beer board, I don't know how you want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=758)|
| 0:12:42| frame the motion. Well, honestly, I don't know. I don't really practice in city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=762)|
| 0:12:47| court. I don't, and you know, these fine folks, you know, I'd imagine they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=767)|
| 0:12:53| going to get down there pretty doggone quick and get the ball rolling. So, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=773)|
| 0:12:58| know, I guess then I'll postpone it for 30 days. Okay, so September 16th. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=778)|
| 0:13:03| the second. There's been a motion and a second. Discussion on the motion? All those in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=783)|
| 0:13:10| favor, aye. Aye. Thank you. September 16th. Let's be good stewards. Let's pass them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=790)|
| 0:13:16| down. I know Councilman Delvaux will be saving trees for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=796)|
| 0:13:28| Number eight is asked to be deferred until 9-16, and I'll make a motion that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=808)|
| 0:13:35| we defer until 9-16. Second. Discussion? All those in favor, aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=815)|
| 0:13:44| Ingrieve, I'm going to assume that light's old. I'm sorry there. It's all right. RBI. Yes, RBI| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=824)|
| 0:13:54| baseball. Next level. Next level. Next level. Sorry, I'm dressed like this. I was just training some of our RBI kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=834)|

| 0:14:17| not been completed. Mr. Driscoll has not been in for processing, and he did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=857)|
| 0:14:20| disclose the denial of a previous beer permit application on his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=860)|
| 0:14:23| application. The denial was April 19th of 2011. The file is complete. I'll make a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=863)|
| 0:14:33| motion we postpone it for 30 days for allowing to do the task class. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=873)|
| 0:14:40| The event is August 29th. The event is next Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=880)|
| 0:14:47| Are they scheduled for the task class? Well, I mean, where are you at on the task| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=887)|
| 0:14:52| class? I apologize. I'm not aware of what the task class is. I apologize. We're both volunteers involved, so if you could help me with that. I'm Steve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=892)|
| 0:15:03| Kweiser, by the way. I help Devin with a lot of his marketing efforts. Well, I mean, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=903)|
| 0:15:08| been the policy of this board that, you know, if you haven't been to the class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=908)|
| 0:15:12| and there were some other associated issues there. Is that where we get an ABC permit, etc.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=912)|
| 0:15:17| Because we do have that permit. If you'll hold on one second. And it's been a policy that we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=917)|
| 0:15:22| adopted of this board unanimously that, you know, the task class and background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=922)|
| 0:15:28| check and what have you have not been done that, you know, we just don't move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=928)|
| 0:15:30| forward with it. And I, you know, I apologize that it's, you know, your event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=930)|
| 0:15:35| is next Friday, but, I mean, it's very clear and stated as to what the procedure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=935)|
| 0:15:40| is for this, you know, for you to move forward on these special events. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=940)|
| 0:15:44| unfortunately, you all just haven't met that standard. Sir, can I, just for future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=944)|
| 0:15:50| events, what do we, what do we need to do for that so I can, I'm sorry, I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| probably able to. Why don't we take that offline and if you want to call the either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=953)|
| 0:15:58| Sergeant Hunter's office or the council office, I'll have Chairwoman Palmer reach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=958)|
| 0:16:04| out and I'm sure she'll be glad to furnish you all with, you know, the necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=964)|
| 0:16:08| steps. So, there's, there's been a motion and a second. Councilman Campin, are you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=968)|
| 0:16:14| okay. I'm just listening. You look like you wanted to perhaps say something. Okay, so what we're doing is, I mean, if we defer it, it's not going to make any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=974)|
| 0:16:25| difference. I don't know if that's, if we want to just deny it or I don't think a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=985)|
| 0:16:29| deferral is, it's so close in. Draw my motion and we'll just not take a vote, right? Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=989)|
| 0:16:37| I thought we need to, we need to move on it. If I make my motion, we deny it. And I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=997)|
| 0:16:41| second that motion. Okay, all those, is there further discussion on the motion, if not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1001)|
| 0:16:47| all those in favor? Do we have any other, other options? Because I didn't know, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1007)|
| 0:16:52| if a beer permit, if you're denied a beer permit, that's potentially used against you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1012)|
| 0:16:56| in the future? Well, I mean, that's one of the problems that he's, that he's facing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1016)|
| 0:17:01| If you fail to disclose it. I'm sorry. Because I don't want them to rack up a bunch of denials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1021)|
| 0:17:06| if we don't, if we don't need to deny it. Could they be allowed to withdraw it at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1026)|
| 0:17:13| point? Let's hear it from the applicant. I'm sorry, what did we not do besides the denials?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1033)|
| 0:17:18| I'm sorry. You didn't attend the task class. You want to explain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1038)|
| 0:17:25| Every applicant is required by city ordinance to send one of the owners or managers listed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1045)|
| 0:17:30| on the application to the task class, which is held every Thursday from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1050)|
| 0:17:36| Also, all owners or managers on the application need to be fingerprinted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1056)|
| 0:17:39| and have their background checks processed. Did you have a question about the denial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1059)|
| 0:17:45| It was an RBI baseball that didn't have that, in 2011 that was denied? No, that was you as an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1065)|
| 0:17:52| applicant for, I forget the name of it, there was a wrestling event over on Western Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1072)|
| 0:17:58| near an after-school care or a daycare that was denied as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1078)|
| 0:18:02| Okay, that wasn't on OLC, so I'll have to find out that information. We weren't established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1082)|
| 0:18:06| then, so to my knowledge, so I'll have to find that information out because we didn't have an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1086)|
| 0:18:10| event then. We just started OLC. It wasn't RBI baseball, it was you personally. You were the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1090)|
| 0:18:16| Devin Driscoll was the name of the applicant. Yeah, that's me. Okay, I'll find out because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1096)|
| 0:18:19| didn't have an event then, so I'll find that out. Okay, thank you. Hold on, Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1099)|
| 0:18:25| I want to ask you, it looks like you're going to have to anyway, reschedule? Can you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1105)|
| 0:18:33| a couple of months from now? Yeah, we're doing it with Visit Knoxville as like a kickoff to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1113)|
| 0:18:38| Boomsday weekend, so it's kind of a way for us to raise money for jerseys for RBI baseball for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1118)|
| 0:18:43| the fall, so we just have to go on without beer, I guess. Councilman Delahoe. Yeah, I just want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1123)|
| 0:18:49| make sure you understood the exchanges going back and forth. If you withdraw this application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1129)|
| 0:18:55| there won't be an event denied and it won't show up in the next search. We can't really grant it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1135)|
| 0:19:01| and your event's so close at hand, there's no way you're getting the beer permit for this particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1141)|
| 0:19:05| event, so I guess you can get hire's root beer and kind of celebrate that way, but that might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1145)|
| 0:19:11| be to your advantage. The task class is to help people know not to serve minors and how to handle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1151)|
| 0:19:16| things and there's procedures and our drug commission helps folks do that just to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1156)|
| 0:19:21| just to be sure that you're ready to carry out your activity in a proper way. Councilman Steger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1161)|
| 0:19:29| That was an old line, but I guess, are y'all going to withdraw it? Yes. Okay, do we need a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1169)|
| 0:19:36| to permit them to withdraw? I'd move to let the applicants withdraw their application. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1176)|
| 0:19:45| Point of order. There is a motion and a second on the floor. Substitute motion. He's entered a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1185)|
| 0:19:53| substitute motion, which is a proper motion. That's what I'm saying, I just want to be clear. It's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| substitute motion. Okay. So we'll vote on the motion as I can withdraw it. I'll withdraw my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1197)|

| 0:27:55| Administrative hearings. We also have a couple of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1675)|
| 0:28:08| administrative hearings. This first one is, well, to me it's a little bit unusual in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1688)|
| 0:28:17| the, we've got the TBAC charge that we, well, I tell you what, Mr. Frost, I know we have no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1697)|
| 0:28:27| discretion over the TBAC and they were, there was a 10-day suspension given to Cancun's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1707)|
| 0:28:35| on Chapman Highway. It's my understanding, correct me if I'm wrong, in that we have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1715)|
| 0:28:41| we have no discretion but to follow that because it was prior to July 1st of this year. Right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1721)|
| 0:28:47| the, my advice to the beer board is that it be sent on to the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1727)|
| 0:28:55| The state law changed on July 1st. This infraction occurred before July 1st and out of an abundance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1735)|
| 0:29:02| of caution yesterday I called Nashville and spoke with an attorney in the TABC office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1742)|
| 0:29:08| to confirm that. That's the first issue they are here for. The second issue that they are here for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1748)|
| 0:29:16| is the result of two underage sales within a rolling two-year period. Okay, so why don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1756)|
| 0:29:22| I go ahead and let the gentleman address this and identify themselves, please. Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1762)|
| 0:29:28| Vice Mayor. I'm Ryan Connor, attorney at Payne Tarwater here in Knoxville on behalf of Cancun| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1768)|
| 0:29:35| Mexican Restaurant. With me is Roberto Ruiz, a member of the ownership group of the restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1775)|
| 0:29:42| and I've had discussions with Mr. Frost about interpretation of this particular statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1782)|
| 0:29:49| and understand that he spoke with the TABC and confirmed his interpretation of it. I guess for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1789)|
| 0:29:55| record purposes, for what it's worth, I think there's a little ambiguity there. This violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1795)|
| 0:30:03| actually occurred on June 19th this year. The law changed July 1st. We were actually received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1803)|
| 0:30:13| our suspension from the TABC on July 23rd. The language in the statute seems to suggest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1813)|
| 0:30:20| at least in our interpretation, that the time period that actually triggers the statute is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1820)|
| 0:30:29| either the suspension itself or the sending of the written letter from TABC to the local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1829)|
| 0:30:37| beer board. We would just make that clear as to our position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1837)|
| 0:30:49| Well, I respectfully disagree. I mean, you know, to play it safe knowing I'd be advising this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1849)|
| 0:30:55| that's why I picked up the phone and spoke to the attorney for the ABC who actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1855)|
| 0:31:00| Joshua, I don't remember, Steph yesterday, just to make sure that, you know, that was their intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1860)|
| 0:31:10| As the beer board may recall, at our last, our July beer board meeting, we had another similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1870)|
| 0:31:19| situation where the person, excuse me, the business sold, the TABC completed their action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1879)|
| 0:31:29| in the month of July, and someone still came and said, hey, hold on, we don't think it applies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1889)|
| 0:31:36| I mean, possibly if I was representing, if I was Mr. Conner's shoe and I was trying to advocate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1896)|
| 0:31:43| for my client, I might say the same thing. But as someone reading the statute and conferring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1903)|
| 0:31:48| with the ABC, I respectfully disagree. All right, so I think the proper way to handle this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1908)|
| 0:31:54| we need to handle this first and then look at the other charge after that. So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1914)|
| 0:32:04| Do we need a motion? I make a motion. Second. To send it on. To send it to the hearing office. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1924)|
| 0:32:11| make a motion to send it on. Second. There's a motion and a second on the first charge to send| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1931)|
| 0:32:16| them on to the hearing officer. Further discussion on that? If not, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1936)|
| 0:32:24| Opposed? Okay. And then we've got the second, you know, administrative thing to deal with here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1944)|
| 0:32:33| in that they've had two sales to underage, you know, within the two-year rolling period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1953)|
| 0:32:39| So that is a second issue that we have to deal with. Mr. Brown. And in this one, the beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1959)|
| 0:32:47| in my opinion, does have discretion under the city ordinances. The beer board can, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1967)|
| 0:32:53| the folks here have paid their fine. They've submitted the remedial plan. If you all determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1973)|
| 0:32:59| that their remedial plan and their explanation is sufficient, you don't have to take further action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1979)|
| 0:33:05| If you do determine that it's insufficient, you can refer them on to the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1985)|
| 0:33:12| Let me ask you this. I mean, because it is, this is a little bit, to me, a little bit unique. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1992)|
| 0:33:17| they're already going to, you know, they're going already. So, can it, I mean, we can either take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=1997)|
| 0:33:25| action or not take action. I think probably we ought to hear about the remedial plan first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2005)|
| 0:33:29| and then that'll help clarify perhaps a decision there. So, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2009)|
| 0:33:34| Sure. And just a brief review of the facts of the actual incident. On June 19th, TABC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2014)|
| 0:33:41| my understanding, TABC and KPD together conducted a joint sting on the Cancun location off Chapman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2021)|
| 0:33:48| Highway. And an 18-year-old female ordered a drink, was ID'd by our waitress. The waitress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2028)|
| 0:33:57| apparently read the ID, simply misread it, and served her anyway. The Cancun has a zero tolerance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2037)|
| 0:34:06| policy for that type of violation. The waitress was immediately terminated, and we have paid the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2046)|
| 0:34:15| fine associated with the city ordinance citation, submitted the remedial plan. The remedial plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2055)|
| 0:34:23| is three major prongs. One step is an employee acknowledgement form, which every employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2063)|
| 0:34:33| employed by Cancun will fill out, and it's basically a certification stating that they understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2073)|
| 0:34:41| Cancun's alcohol policy and their zero tolerance when it comes to selling underage. The second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2081)|
| 0:34:49| prong is a shift form that each waitress, waiter, bartender, whomever will sign before they begin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2089)|
| 0:35:00| their shift. Again, reiterating that policy in an attempt to make it abundantly clear what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2100)|
| 0:35:07| restaurant's position is. The third step is that Mr. Ruiz himself, as the owner, is going to conduct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2107)|
| 0:35:16| bi-monthly meetings with all staff members and managers coming from the individual owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2116)|
| 0:35:25| We feel that that may have a greater effect than pieces of paper, although we have faith that those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2125)|
| 0:35:33| should work as well. And obviously, we would be happy to implement anything that the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2133)|
| 0:35:39| thinks would be appropriate. Mr. Frost, again, and I had a conversation about other potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2139)|
| 0:35:45| options. Several of those have already been implemented by Cancun, so they were left off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2145)|
| 0:35:52| the remedial plan. And I might add, I mean, they're going, they're already going. They're,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2152)|
| 0:36:01| they have to mirror what the TBAC does, and it was a 10-day suspension. Did you say you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2161)|
| 0:36:07| have served that? It's a 10-day suspension, begins August 25th. Okay, and then they paid a $500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2167)|
| 0:36:13| fine, which has already been paid. And so, we, whatever the board's, you know, they're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2173)|
| 0:36:22| already, and they're. I'm confused. I mean, would they have to go twice for the same violation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2182)|
| 0:36:27| It might be. This doesn't make any sense to me. It might be heard by the same hearing officer. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2187)|
| 0:36:32| mean, it's, it's, it's, they have the potential for two, I guess, distinct hearings, just kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2192)|
| 0:36:38| of like the beer board is having two distinct hearings tonight, but they're one right after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2198)|
| 0:36:44| the other. The AB. And it's for the same, but it's for the same, no, no, no. It's under a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2204)|
| 0:36:51| it's different violations. It's, if I. Hold on, please. Hold on, please. Sure. One second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2211)|
| 0:36:57| It's different violations. I believe you said it was Sergeant Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2217)|
| 0:37:03| Typically, in cases such as this, Ms. Ebertin with the law department will write up a non-compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2223)|
| 0:37:08| complaint and include everything in one complaint. So, it will be one hearing. It'll include the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2228)|
| 0:37:14| the specifics about the ABC agreement and also the specifics about the two sales within the two year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2234)|
| 0:37:21| Yes, sir. I think Councilman Starr. Yeah, go ahead. The, the, the, the incident giving rise to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2241)|
| 0:37:29| two, it was the same incident that just broke two separate laws. Is that a fair way to put it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2249)|
| 0:37:36| Right. Well, yeah, yeah. ABC and KPD were there at the same time. Correct. But it was just one sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2256)|
| 0:37:46| that was. Right. But it was just the incident on June 19, 2014 we're talking about. Right. Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2266)|
| 0:37:51| it also, it reflects back to the, the earlier underage sale. Sure. It's, it's. The 2012. If,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2271)|
| 0:37:57| if this was your first beer issue, you would not be here today. Okay. I understand. But it's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2277)|
| 0:38:06| second offense that triggered both. They got two within a two year period. That's what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2286)|
| 0:38:13| discussing now. The administrative part. Yeah, the administrative part. Councilman Grieve. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2293)|
| 0:38:18| If I understand correctly, it will be combined with the first one if we send it to the hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2298)|
| 0:38:22| board. That's correct. Okay. I make a motion that we send it to the hearing board. Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2302)|

| 0:39:11| Sorry about that. It's so difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2351)|
| 0:39:15| It's not just ATRAC. It's not just ATRAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2355)|
| 0:39:21| It's the LA Express.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2361)|
| 0:39:22| The hotline people weren't going to get approved anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2362)|
| 0:39:29| The who?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2369)|
| 0:39:30| The hotline's not going to get approved anyway. Look where I'm circling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2373)|
| 0:39:34| Hold on one second, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2374)|
| 0:39:37| Oh, okay. But we still need to take action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2377)|
| 0:39:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2383)|
| 0:39:46| Bill, attorney for Omshi Shire Express LLC, the corporation on Speed Mark Deli.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2386)|
| 0:39:54| I'm here with Matul Kaliwala, the member of the LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2394)|
| 0:39:59| That's at 217 Chapman Highway in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2399)|
| 0:40:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2403)|
| 0:40:06| Yeah, this is just what we dealt with. The two charges went within a two-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2406)|
| 0:40:12| So, if you've got a remedial plan or how do you plan to not come back before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2412)|
| 0:40:18| Yes, we've filed a remedial plan and paid the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2418)|
| 0:40:25| But the remedial plan, the LLC has purchased an age verification machine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2425)|
| 0:40:32| and trained its employees on how to use that machine to check the licenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2432)|
| 0:40:36| to make sure that mistakes aren't made when someone comes in that tries to buy a purchased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2436)|
| 0:40:43| beer that may be underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| As long as they use that machine, it should tell them whether the date on the license is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2445)|
| 0:40:49| right or not and hopefully prevent some human error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2449)|
| 0:40:52| Mr. Kaliwala has also reviewed his information he got from the task force and has reviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2452)|
| 0:40:57| each of those with his employees and stressed to them that they must check these licenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2457)|
| 0:41:03| every time that someone comes in to use or to buy beer and to use this age verification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2463)|
| 0:41:09| machine to prevent these things in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2469)|
| 0:41:13| What's the cost of the machine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2473)|
| 0:41:16| I believe originally it was $300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2476)|
| 0:41:19| $300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2481)|
| 0:41:22| So have they been to a hearing, officer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2482)|
| 0:41:25| Is that our option here is whether to send it on or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2485)|
| 0:41:29| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2489)|
| 0:41:30| After the first sale, they didn't submit a remedial plan by the deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2490)|
| 0:41:35| So we filed a noncompliance complaint and then pursuant to an agreed order dated September| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2495)|
| 0:41:42| 18th of 2012, they paid a $250 fine and submitted the remedial plan at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2502)|
| 0:41:47| And that was for the first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2507)|
| 0:41:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2512)|
| 0:41:58| Customer Dela Lope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2518)|
| 0:41:59| Yeah, I understand that if I'm looking at the right letter, the August 12th letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2519)|
| 0:42:03| that there's also going to be some retraining on the equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2523)|
| 0:42:08| I guess periodic meetings with your folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2528)|
| 0:42:12| Yes, this was a particular incident with a new hire and for some reason that new hire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2532)|
| 0:42:17| did not use the age verification machine despite being trained on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2537)|
| 0:42:21| And so again, he's going to meet with the employees and I have met with the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2541)|
| 0:42:27| and told them, went through all the processes again and what they're supposed to be doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2547)|
| 0:42:31| to stress that you can't be selling the beer to minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2551)|
| 0:42:36| And how to use the machine and who's supposed to use it and check the license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2556)|
| 0:42:39| Do you take the license and literally have the machine read it or do you key in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2559)|
| 0:42:45| Please come to the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| You just have to be slide inside and they will show you if it's expired, what's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2567)|
| 0:42:50| age and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2570)|
| 0:42:53| So that way, you know, if it's a 20, they will show a 20 age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2573)|
| 0:42:56| If it's expired, the machine show you it's expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2576)|
| 0:42:58| That means you have to be denied it right away to not to sell that beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2578)|
| 0:43:02| But he doesn't manually enter the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2582)|
| 0:43:04| He literally lets the machine read it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| Yeah, machine will read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2586)|
| 0:43:07| You have to be scan inside, slide inside that just like a credit card you slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2587)|
| 0:43:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2591)|
| 0:43:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2593)|
| 0:43:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2594)|
| 0:43:15| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2595)|
| 0:43:15| Have you take you said in the letter that you were willing to take the task class again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2595)|
| 0:43:19| Have you done that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2599)|
| 0:43:20| Yeah, I mean, talk to my employer already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2600)|
| 0:43:22| He's going to get an appointment to get next week to get the test class because he had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2602)|
| 0:43:27| a court was court was last week and he went to court and get everything done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2607)|
| 0:43:32| I make a motion that we postpone it for 30 days and give him time to have a test class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2612)|
| 0:43:37| and then we'll pass on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2617)|
| 0:43:41| I'll second this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2621)|
| 0:43:44| So the motion is that they complete the test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| He said he would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2626)|
| 0:43:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2627)|
| 0:43:48| And we have no and once you turn him loose, you have no you have no leverage against him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2628)|
| 0:43:52| to whether he does it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2632)|
| 0:43:53| So that sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2633)|
| 0:43:54| It's 30 days to get it done and it comes back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| So we'll postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2636)|
| 0:43:57| And then if he didn't get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| I mean, what I see out of this, quite honestly, is, you know, is a little bit of a spirit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2639)|
| 0:44:03| of, you know, of not cooperating enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2643)|
| 0:44:07| You know, noncompliance filed, sued, blah, blah, blah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2647)|
| 0:44:12| I mean, you know, so he said he'd do it when I say he does it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2652)|
| 0:44:15| And then we'll be meet back here in 30 days to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2655)|
| 0:44:17| So what the motion is, we'll defer this until September the 16th, your board hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2657)|
| 0:44:22| And as long as you well, you'll need to be sure and do what you said you're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2662)|
| 0:44:27| do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2667)|
| 0:44:27| And then we'll deal with it finality at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2667)|
| 0:44:31| So it is a proper motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| There's a further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2673)|
| 0:44:34| There has been a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2674)|
| 0:44:35| All those in favor of the deferral say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2679)|
| 0:44:39| See you September 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2679)|
| 0:44:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2680)|
| 0:44:42| Hot Rod.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2682)|
| 0:44:43| Hot Rod.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2683)|
| 0:44:44| Does anybody here from Hot Rod?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2684)|
| 0:44:46| They had some issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2686)|
| 0:44:47| They didn't have a background check and fingerprints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2687)|
| 0:44:50| So I don't think they would have gotten very far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2690)|
| 0:44:53| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2693)|
| 0:44:54| Well, I'll make a motion that we move it to the next beer board is in September the 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2694)|
| 0:45:01| So we'll defer or postpone until September the 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2701)|
| 0:45:05| Councilman Delbo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2705)|
| 0:45:06| Do we have a mechanism to notify them of their deficiencies before that so that we don't come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2706)|
| 0:45:11| here with a strikeout shaking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2713)|
| 0:45:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2714)|
| 0:45:15| Every month before the beer board meeting, I send out a notice, a letter telling them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2715)|
| 0:45:19| it's still a notifying of the beer board date and items that are still missing from their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2719)|
| 0:45:24| file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2724)|
| 0:45:24| You give them a checklist of things they got to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2726)|
| 0:45:27| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2727)|
| 0:45:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2727)|
| 0:45:28| So they don't have any excuse when they get here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2728)|
| 0:45:31| I hope not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2731)|
| 0:45:32| So we're going to the motion is to defer until September 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2732)|

| 0:45:53| Thumbs down or thumb up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd140819?start=2753)|
