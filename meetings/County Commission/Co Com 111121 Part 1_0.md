| 0:06:02| He's going to give me a call, and then I'll go out and inspect the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=362)|
| 0:06:06| They're supposed to change ownership at the end of month or next month sometime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=366)|
| 0:06:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=371)|

| 0:06:19| Pending final inspection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=379)|
| 0:06:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=380)|
| 0:06:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=381)|
| 0:06:22| I'll defer to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=382)|
| 0:06:23| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=383)|
| 0:06:24| I'll make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=384)|
| 0:06:25| Where's the current owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=385)|
| 0:06:26| Where's he going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=386)|
| 0:06:27| Is he just getting out of the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=387)|
| 0:06:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=390)|
| 0:06:31| I guess he's retiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=391)|
| 0:06:33| He's been there for over 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=393)|
| 0:06:35| I'll be about to visit you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=395)|
| 0:06:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=398)|
| 0:06:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=399)|
| 0:06:40| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=400)|
| 0:06:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=401)|
| 0:06:42| It's got to be pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=402)|
| 0:06:43| This is pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=403)|
| 0:06:44| Your motion is pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=404)|
| 0:06:45| You realize you can't get a beer license until ownership switches and they inspect, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=405)|
| 0:06:49| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=409)|
| 0:06:50| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=410)|
| 0:06:51| I'll get them to clear everything, and then they'll forward it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=411)|
| 0:06:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=416)|
| 0:06:57| And you're aware because he's surrendered the beer permit, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=417)|
| 0:07:00| No, I'm not surrendering it today because once we get everything taken care of, then I'll bring the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=420)|
| 0:07:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=427)|
| 0:07:08| Just making sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=428)|
| 0:07:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=429)|
| 0:07:10| Motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=430)|
| 0:07:11| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=431)|
| 0:07:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=432)|
| 0:07:13| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=433)|
| 0:07:14| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=434)|
| 0:07:15| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=435)|
| 0:07:16| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=436)|
| 0:07:17| Any other business to come before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=437)|
| 0:07:18| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=438)|
| 0:07:19| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=439)|
| 0:07:20| The reason I had my light on earlier was not to lead the Pledge of Allegiance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=440)|
| 0:07:23| but I am honored by the privilege to lead the Pledge of Allegiance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=443)|
| 0:07:30| I have a question that I wanted to add a discussion item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=450)|
| 0:07:33| and I'd like to ask the indulgence of the beer board here for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=453)|
| 0:07:39| At some upcoming point in time, we're going to have a conference commission with Ryan Haynes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=459)|
| 0:07:45| and I believe that we've had the discussion at either the beer board or the pool commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=465)|
| 0:07:52| about when there are violations of the underage selling of beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=472)|
| 0:08:00| the penalty lies solely and only with the owner, as it is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=480)|
| 0:08:06| At one point in time, we had some discussion about the person that made the sale having some kind of responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=486)|
| 0:08:13| or penalty to pay, and I've forgotten our discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=493)|
| 0:08:18| I've slept since then, so I need to replow that ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=498)|
| 0:08:22| Can I address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=502)|
| 0:08:24| Commissioner Brown and myself are on an underage beer count task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=504)|
| 0:08:30| and what we're discussing is we would have the ability later through a they have to have the ability to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=510)|
| 0:08:39| through a certification, and we're considering that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=519)|
| 0:08:42| And so that could come before us in legislation where, and I hate to get too deep into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=522)|
| 0:08:48| I don't want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=528)|
| 0:08:49| I do not want any depth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=529)|
| 0:08:50| What I wanted to make sure of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=530)|
| 0:08:51| We're looking at disallowing them to sell for a certain period of time after a sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=531)|
| 0:08:56| And is this something that's going to be state law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=536)|
| 0:09:01| No, it will be county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=541)|
| 0:09:02| Just county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=542)|
| 0:09:03| And the reason I ask is because if we have a commission meeting with Ryan Haynes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=543)|
| 0:09:08| if this is something that's state, then I want it to be on the agenda of that discussion at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=548)|
| 0:09:14| It may still be appropriate for us to discuss with Ryan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=554)|
| 0:09:17| It could, but the state doesn't regulate beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=557)|
| 0:09:19| They just regulate liquor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=559)|
| 0:09:20| So anything outside, well, they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=560)|
| 0:09:22| I mean, it's up to the commission and operating within our beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=562)|
| 0:09:26| Okay, because I know we've had, I've had personal requests from, I'll say, owner operators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=566)|
| 0:09:33| We're trying to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=573)|
| 0:09:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=575)|
| 0:09:36| As long as that's still something that's before us, that satisfies me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=576)|
| 0:09:39| There will be a multitude of changes, hopefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=579)|
| 0:09:41| And this also, for the rest of you's information, will dovetail the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=581)|
| 0:09:48| and county laws together as much as we can so that it's easier for both our law enforcement agencies to enforce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=588)|
| 0:09:56| So it's, we're getting close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=596)|
| 0:09:59| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=599)|
| 0:10:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=601)|
| 0:10:02| The other thing Commissioner Wright was referencing is Ryan Haynes, December 2nd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=602)|
| 0:10:07| across the street at the Bisou, or Bistro, Bistro in the Bisou at noon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=607)|
| 0:10:13| It's a working lunch audit-related hotline, but beer issues also, anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=613)|
| 0:10:19| Well, I think we need to consider that in that we can maybe talk about anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=619)|
| 0:10:25| but we need to have that anything on our agenda for the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=625)|
| 0:10:29| So that is December 2nd at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=629)|
| 0:10:31| At noon across the street at the Bisou.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=631)|
| 0:10:34| It's currently noticed for a singular issue, however, the hotline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=634)|
| 0:10:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=637)|
| 0:10:38| And I think that I would like to pass this discussion on to full commission that we may have the hotline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=638)|
| 0:10:45| We may discuss beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=645)|
| 0:10:47| And then I have two other issues that I'd like to have as a discussion on that agenda with our representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=647)|
| 0:10:54| Now, is that at the Bisou or the Bistro?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=654)|
| 0:10:57| Whatever the restaurant is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=657)|
| 0:10:58| Bistro at the Bisou.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=658)|
| 0:10:59| Bistro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=659)|
| 0:11:00| Bistro at the Bisou restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=660)|
| 0:11:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=661)|
| 0:11:02| Bistro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=662)|
| 0:11:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=663)|
| 0:11:04| Some Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=664)|
| 0:11:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=665)|
| 0:11:06| It's on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=666)|
| 0:11:07| Friday, December 2nd, and it is Dutch treat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=667)|
| 0:11:08| I don't think Law Director Jarrett has agreed to pay for lunch yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=668)|
| 0:11:11| Now, the other thing I could do, too, is have him come to our chairman's lunch in December, if you'd like to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=671)|
| 0:11:17| Yeah, that may be cleaner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=677)|
| 0:11:18| Yeah, that way we can go ahead and properly notice everything, get your items on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=678)|
| 0:11:22| and that way you can focus on the audit things that you're going to do, whichever one you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=682)|
| 0:11:26| But I don't have an agenda for December, and I'm happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=686)|
| 0:11:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=689)|
| 0:11:30| What we need is an agreement from him if he would be available for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=690)|
| 0:11:34| If he's not available for our chairman's lunch, then at this other meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=694)|
| 0:11:40| I still have three or four items I'd like for us commission to maybe discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=700)|
| 0:11:45| and be on one side or the other of a record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=705)|
| 0:11:48| I'll see if I can call him during the break here and have something by 145.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=708)|
| 0:11:52| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=712)|
| 0:11:53| Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=713)|
| 0:11:54| We'll adjourn until 145.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=714)|

| 0:12:13| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=733)|

| 0:14:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=883)|
| 0:14:44| Mr. Chairman, anytime that we have anybody in Knox County employment that does stuff on a local level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=884)|
| 0:14:52| even higher to a state level, but then on a national level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=892)|
| 0:14:55| when you work your way up as presidency of an organization, that says a lot about the individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=895)|
| 0:15:00| And we see Lynn out here at our monthly meetings and whatnot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=900)|
| 0:15:03| but you can tell what she's done, what was read from the record of things she does out in the community also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=903)|
| 0:15:07| So I like to see a well-rounded employee that does their work and puts back in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=907)|
| 0:15:12| And Lynn has always done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=912)|
| 0:15:14| So, Lynn, we want to, on behalf of the commission, want to give you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=914)|
| 0:15:17| And Ms. Broyles, I think, Dean, did you want to say a few words too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=917)|
| 0:15:30| Dean Rice, 925 Mid-South Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=930)|
| 0:15:33| Mayor Berkshire was unable to be here at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=933)|
| 0:15:35| but he wanted me to come and just reiterate what Commissioner Smith said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=935)|
| 0:15:39| And first, we express appreciation to Commissioner Broyles and to Commissioner Smith for bringing this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=939)|
| 0:15:43| There's no employee in Knox County who brings a higher degree of professionalism and character and integrity to their job than Lynn does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=943)|
| 0:15:50| And the mayor appreciates all the work she does, and probably one of the most challenging jobs in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=950)|
| 0:15:55| and just appreciates her and her entire team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=955)|
| 0:15:58| So, congratulations, Lynn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=958)|
| 0:15:59| I appreciate that very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=959)|
| 0:16:02| And I just wanted to say that Lynn has always been someone as a woman and a public servant that I've looked up to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=962)|
| 0:16:10| She's been an excellent role model for all county employees and for other women in government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=970)|
| 0:16:16| and someone that I've admired and I'm very proud to work with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=976)|
| 0:16:22| And I'm so happy that we had the opportunity to honor you today, Lynn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=982)|

| 0:16:31| But I am going to give you the opportunity to say a few words if you'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=991)|
| 0:16:39| I just want to thank everyone involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=999)|
| 0:16:41| I really do appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1001)|
| 0:16:43| It has been a pleasure serving everyone for these 30-plus years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1003)|
| 0:16:47| I hope I've got a few more in me, maybe about five or six more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1007)|
| 0:16:53| So, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1013)|
| 0:16:54| Thank you, Lynn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1014)|
| 0:16:55| We appreciate your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1015)|
| 0:16:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1017)|

| 0:17:53| I'm going to ask that since it is kind of a unique thing that he does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1073)|
| 0:17:57| I'm going to ask that Ms. Angie, if she will, read that into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1077)|

| 0:20:06| Thank you, Angie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1206)|
| 0:20:08| This is just part of what Brian's involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1208)|
| 0:20:11| He's also on the board of directors at Iams Nature Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1211)|
| 0:20:14| and a very big part of the land committee over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1214)|
| 0:20:19| Over the last year, there have been, I don't know, Doug, you might be able to give us a more accurate idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1219)|
| 0:20:25| or Brian, you may be, on the number of acres that have been added to this urban wilderness district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1225)|
| 0:20:30| And so far, Brian and his group have mapped out, cleared out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1230)|
| 0:20:36| about 30 miles of biking and hiking trails for people in Knox County to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1236)|
| 0:20:42| They're going to be coming from all over the southeast to see what we have here in our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1242)|
| 0:20:47| And it's a great pleasure that I present this to Brian today on behalf of his work and the bike club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1247)|
| 0:20:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1254)|
| 0:20:57| I'd like to thank commission for this consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1257)|
| 0:21:05| It's been a real pleasure working with Carol Evans with the Legacy Parks Foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1265)|
| 0:21:10| on acquiring the property that's needed to do this loop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1270)|
| 0:21:15| I'd like to thank you all for your support of the project, because without your support, it wouldn't really go anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1275)|
| 0:21:21| And then Doug Battelle with his tremendous support with Knox County Parks and Rec.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1281)|
| 0:21:26| And Doug is actually out there on weekends building trail with us, and he's riding his bike too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1286)|
| 0:21:32| But it's a really great project that hopefully will have some real positive benefits in the next year or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1292)|
| 0:21:41| We hope to have a sign package in place advertising this trail system from downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1301)|
| 0:21:47| Like Mike said, I really believe that people will come into town just to do what we've been working so hard to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1307)|
| 0:21:53| But thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1313)|
| 0:21:55| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1315)|
| 0:22:01| I forgot, not only has he opened up his property to put some of these trails through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1321)|
| 0:22:05| but he has about six of his neighbors out there lined up to do the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1325)|
| 0:22:09| And they are doing a cleanup out in their area out there that you would not believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1329)|
| 0:22:13| I mean, it is absolutely astronomical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1333)|
| 0:22:16| So we appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1336)|
| 0:22:17| Doug, do you have anything you'd like to say about this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1337)|
| 0:22:20| Just, again, a tremendous group of volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1340)|
| 0:22:22| I mean, this is a fantastic club because you'll see 40 or 50 people out on work days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1342)|
| 0:22:27| They're carpenters or plumbers or doctors or lawyers from all walks of life just kind of coming together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1347)|
| 0:22:31| And I heard one of the best compliments about the project in South Knox County this weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1351)|
| 0:22:35| I was riding down there, ran upon a group of folks that I hadn't seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1355)|
| 0:22:38| A few of them I knew, some I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1358)|
| 0:22:40| Well, one of them I didn't know said, this is better than Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| So that's a compliment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1362)|
| 0:22:48| Dean Rice, 925 Mid-South Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| And you'll ask me not to come back up here, I'm sure, in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1370)|
| 0:22:52| But, again, the mayor is unable to be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1372)|
| 0:22:54| but he does appreciate everything that Brian has done and his entire group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1374)|
| 0:22:57| And there's an, as you know, the mayor strongly supports volunteerism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1377)|
| 0:23:01| And when people come together that aren't asking for titles, aren't asking for accolades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1381)|
| 0:23:05| but are just out doing the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1385)|
| 0:23:07| And I think this organization represents that very thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1387)|
| 0:23:10| So, congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1390)|
| 0:23:12| Brian, again, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1392)|
| 0:23:15| Clerk, Resolution 104.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1395)|
| 0:23:18| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee, honoring the City of Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1398)|
| 0:23:22| Will Mayor elect Madeline Rojero?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1402)|
| 0:23:24| I'd like to add an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| I know that Commissioners McKenzie and Broyles are the lead sponsors on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1406)|
| 0:23:29| but I'd like to add an amendment that this be from the full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1409)|
| 0:23:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1412)|
| 0:23:33| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1413)|
| 0:23:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1414)|
| 0:23:35| Commissioner Broyles and Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1415)|
| 0:23:38| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1418)|
| 0:23:41| I'd just like to, you know, spend a quick second just for two reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1421)|
| 0:23:48| And the reason that I feel that needed to come early in her career from this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1428)|
| 0:23:54| because this is where Madeline first cut her teeth, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1434)|
| 0:23:58| She was first elected to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1438)|
| 0:24:03| And she's gone on and done a whole lot of things since then, but did extremely good work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1443)|
| 0:24:08| And then, secondly, because of the type and nature of the campaign that she ran,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1448)|
| 0:24:13| she ran a really positive campaign, which was, you know, difficult sometimes to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1453)|
| 0:24:19| But she really did keep it at a very high level and at a very professional level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1459)|
| 0:24:24| And so I just applaud her for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1464)|
| 0:24:27| But I would like this to be written to the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1467)|
| 0:24:32| Whereas the citizens of Knoxville, Mayor Lake Madeline Rojero was recently elected city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1472)|
| 0:24:37| to serve as the city's first female mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1477)|
| 0:24:40| and whereas Mayor Lake Madeline Rojero has a long history of dedication to our local citizenry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1480)|
| 0:24:46| as a result of her public service as Knox County Commissioner, District 2, 1990 through 1998,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1486)|
| 0:24:53| Director of Community Development, City of Knoxville, 2007 through 2011,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1493)|
| 0:24:58| Chair of the Knox County Task Force to Develop Economic Development Strategic Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1498)|
| 0:25:02| a member of the Mayor's Task Force on Solid Waste, and Chair of the Government and Leadership Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1502)|
| 0:25:07| to name but a few examples of many boards and commissions upon which she served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1507)|
| 0:25:11| And whereas along with her extensive public service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1511)|
| 0:25:14| Mayor Lake Madeline Rojero has had bestowed upon her numerous community-based recognitions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1514)|
| 0:25:21| including but not limited to 2006 YWCA Knoxville Tribute to Women Business and Government Award,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1521)|
| 0:25:28| the 2003 Knoxville Union of the Year Award,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1528)|
| 0:25:31| and the 2001 Diversity Award for Work with Knoxville's Promise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1531)|
| 0:25:35| the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Commemoration Commission, the Greater Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1535)|
| 0:25:41| and whereas Mayor Lake Madeline Rojero has pledged to spend a good deal of time working on job creation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1541)|
| 0:25:47| to make Knoxville a more business-friendly city with a climate of local businesses to prosper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1547)|
| 0:25:52| as well as spend time working with the Knox County Trustee's Office and state legislators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1552)|
| 0:25:57| on an effort to amend state law to make it easier for local governments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1557)|
| 0:26:01| to deal with the issue of blighted and abandoned properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1561)|
| 0:26:04| Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Commission of Knox County as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1564)|
| 0:26:08| The Commission of Knox County hereby honors Knoxville Mayor Lake Madeline Rojero| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1568)|
| 0:26:12| for her years of dedicated service to the people of Knox County as well as for her election victory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1572)|
| 0:26:18| We extend to Mayor Lake Madeline Rojero best wishes for continued success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1578)|
| 0:26:23| as she assumes the office of Mayor of the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1583)|
| 0:26:26| Be it further resolved that this resolution be presented to Knoxville Mayor Lake Madeline Rojero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1586)|
| 0:26:31| Be it further resolved that this resolution is to take effect from and after its passage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1591)|
| 0:26:35| as provided by the Charter of Knox County, Tennessee, the public welfare requiring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1595)|
| 0:26:41| Mr. Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| Thank you. I just wanted to add that when Madeline was first elected to County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1603)|
| 0:26:47| she was actually elected and sat in the seat that I now serve in 2nd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1607)|
| 0:26:54| And when I first decided to run for office, Madeline was one of the first people that I spoke to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1614)|
| 0:26:59| and one of my earliest supporters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1619)|
| 0:27:02| And I think I was probably more excited on her election night than I was on my own election night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1622)|
| 0:27:10| when I first got elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| This has been a wonderful year. It's a great time for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1632)|
| 0:27:17| It's a great time for our economy. It's a great time for our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1637)|
| 0:27:23| Madeline, I know, can go anywhere and hold her own and do what's best for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1643)|
| 0:27:29| It's really exciting to have our first woman mayor in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1649)|
| 0:27:33| It's only taken us almost a couple hundred years to get here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1653)|
| 0:27:37| But who's counting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1657)|
| 0:27:39| Yeah, but who's counting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| And I'm just so incredibly proud and so incredibly pleased and wish you the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1661)|
| 0:27:49| and can't wait to see what the next four years are going to bring for Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1669)|
| 0:27:53| because I know they're going to be fabulous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1673)|
| 0:27:55| So congratulations and thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1675)|
| 0:27:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1677)|
| 0:28:18| Well, thank you so much, Commissioner Broyles and Commissioner McKenzie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1698)|
| 0:28:21| and all of the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1701)|
| 0:28:23| As Sam said, I did cut my teeth in politics on this body as county commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1703)|
| 0:28:29| and it was a wonderful experience for eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1709)|
| 0:28:32| It had its challenges as any elected body does, but it was a great experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1712)|
| 0:28:39| And, you know, I got to know all parts of Knox County as a result of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1719)|
| 0:28:43| and it really has helped prepare me, I think, to be a better mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1723)|
| 0:28:47| Number one, I can't do anything without my city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1727)|
| 0:28:50| And having sat as a county commissioner in a legislative body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1730)|
| 0:28:54| I think I understand what a city council needs in order to be able to make good decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1734)|
| 0:28:58| and get behind our policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| So it was a great experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| I look forward to working very cooperatively, collaboratively with Mayor Burchett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1742)|
| 0:29:07| and with the county commission as we have, you know, all of my area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1747)|
| 0:29:12| all of Knoxville is within Knox County, so we have a lot in common.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1752)|
| 0:29:16| And, of course, even those areas outside of the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| what happens there and what happens within the city impact each other significantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1759)|
| 0:29:25| So thank you for this honor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1765)|
| 0:29:27| and I look forward to working very closely with you and with the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1767)|
| 0:29:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1771)|
| 0:29:32| Ms. Rojero, if you wouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1772)|
| 0:29:33| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1773)|
| 0:29:34| There were a whole list of accolades and achievements there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1774)|
| 0:29:37| and I would like to congratulate you on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1777)|
| 0:29:39| But there's one more I think is very important because we know that these people are very special people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1779)|
| 0:29:44| is that Knoxville's mayor is also a beekeeper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1784)|
| 0:29:48| Oh, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1788)|
| 0:29:50| I was wondering if you were going to get that in the resolution or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1790)|
| 0:29:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1793)|
| 0:29:54| Commissioner Owenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1794)|
| 0:29:55| Yes, I just want to congratulate Madeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1795)|
| 0:29:57| And contrary to what the public likes to say, I do like Madeline very much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1797)|
| 0:30:02| and I look forward to working with you so that we can move our county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1802)|
| 0:30:06| and our city forward in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1808)|
| 0:30:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1809)|
| 0:30:10| Also, we want to just say that we look forward to working with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1810)|
| 0:30:13| We look forward to your administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| And any way that we can help, we stand ready to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1815)|
| 0:30:18| So this is a formal invitation for you to come back any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1818)|
| 0:30:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1820)|
| 0:30:21| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1821)|
| 0:30:22| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1822)|
| 0:30:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1823)|

| 0:30:50| Commissioner Owenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1850)|
| 0:30:51| Yes, there is a lady, Lisa, that would like to speak about something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1851)|
| 0:30:57| She didn't get here in time to sign up, so I'd just like the courtesy for her to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1857)|
| 0:31:01| Certainly, we're happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1861)|
| 0:31:02| If you'd come to the podium, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1862)|

| 0:31:11| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1871)|
| 0:31:12| I am Lisa Moffitt, TSEA field rep for District 1, which includes Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1872)|
| 0:31:17| and as you all are aware, we're facing some changes at Lakeshore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| and I would just like to go on the record and express some concerns that we have regarding this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1881)|
| 0:31:26| and I will read for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1886)|
| 0:31:32| The Tennessee Department of Mental Health Commissioner, Doug Varney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1892)|
| 0:31:35| has announced plans to end admissions to Lakeshore Mental Health Institute on January 1, 2012,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1895)|
| 0:31:43| just 40 days from today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1903)|
| 0:31:46| and to close the facility permanently by June 30, 2012, six months later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1906)|
| 0:31:56| He has stated that these moves are necessary so that persons needing inpatient care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1916)|
| 0:32:01| for diagnosed mental illnesses can receive that care in smaller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1921)|
| 0:32:05| non-institutional settings in their own communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1925)|
| 0:32:09| He has told Governor Haslam that this move is a moral thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1929)|
| 0:32:15| Although the state may also realize some savings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| this is not given as a primary reason for this proposed closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1937)|
| 0:32:22| Lakeshore is presently the home to 89 patients and is staffed by around 360 full-time staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1942)|
| 0:32:30| These are state employees, many living in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1950)|
| 0:32:33| The closure would result in all 360 losing their jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1953)|
| 0:32:38| and all remaining patients being transferred out to the three community facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| with which the state presently has contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1962)|
| 0:32:46| These facilities include Covenant-owned Peninsula, located 14 miles from Lakeshore in Louisville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1966)|
| 0:32:52| four counties served by Ridgeview Community Health Systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1972)|
| 0:32:57| excuse me, five counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1977)|
| 0:32:59| and there are four counties that are not being served currently in this close area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1979)|
| 0:33:05| which include Glabrin County, Granger County, Jefferson County, Morgan, and Union County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1985)|
| 0:33:11| All the upper east counties are being covered under the proposed plans by Woodridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1991)|
| 0:33:16| and Mountain State Health Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1996)|
| 0:33:19| Anyone who recalls the deinstitutionalization of mental health patients in Tennessee two decades ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=1999)|
| 0:33:27| will remember how many of the former patients found themselves homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2007)|
| 0:33:30| living under bridges and in back alleys or locked up in our jails and prisons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2010)|
| 0:33:35| While moving Lakeshore's patient population into community settings near their own homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2015)|
| 0:33:40| may be an admirable goal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| failing to do so without appropriate planning and deliberation can lead to tragic consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2022)|
| 0:33:48| Why the rush?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2028)|
| 0:33:51| Why not attempt to move one quarter of the Lakeshore population into the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2031)|
| 0:33:56| in each of the next four years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| This way, the mechanism presently planned for this move can be tested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| We can then know for certain whether the community facilities will accept the more difficult patients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2042)|
| 0:34:07| which they have currently turned down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| We can evaluate the quality of care those patients receive and observe how they fare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2049)|
| 0:34:15| Are they succeeding or are they failing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| We can then adjust the plan in the years to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2057)|
| 0:34:21| We might also want to consider setting up a number of small state-run community facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2061)|
| 0:34:26| operated by experienced state employees who have taken care of these clients, patients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2066)|
| 0:34:31| for many, many, many years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| and spread them throughout the region that are actually in or near the patients' hometowns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2073)|
| 0:34:39| Facilities run by the state are easier to monitor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| and are not affected by any necessity to turn a profit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2081)|
| 0:34:44| or by other business considerations not appropriate to the delivery of mental health services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2084)|
| 0:34:49| Finally, it may be necessary to keep Lakeshore open permanently at some level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2089)|
| 0:34:53| to provide ongoing care for long-term patients for the whole community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2093)|
| 0:34:57| We have two goals here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| The goal is to serve those who need us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2099)|
| 0:35:02| and those to also take care of the employees who have served them for so many years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2102)|
| 0:35:06| and consider them family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2106)|
| 0:35:08| Thank you for consideration and for asking many questions to Commissioner Varney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2108)|
| 0:35:12| and the Governor regarding these changes that are forthcoming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2115)|
| 0:35:16| Mr. Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2116)|
| 0:35:19| Yes, I just wanted to thank you for coming and speaking today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2119)|
| 0:35:23| This is probably one of the most critical issues that's facing our community right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2123)|
| 0:35:28| and I would like to see more community discussion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2128)|
| 0:35:33| As you referred to a couple decades ago with the deinstitutionalization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2133)|
| 0:35:39| a great many of those mentally ill are still on the streets and living under the bridges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2139)|
| 0:35:44| a great many of them in the 1st and 2nd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2144)|
| 0:35:47| We have a great many mentally ill who cycle through our criminal justice system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2147)|
| 0:35:52| This is something that the county has worked on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2152)|
| 0:35:56| We need to work on it harder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| This is going to create a tremendous strain on our already thinly stretched resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2158)|
| 0:36:06| Again, thank you so much for coming and speaking out about this today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2166)|
| 0:36:10| and bringing some more awareness to this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2170)|
| 0:36:12| This is something that we're going to have to address sooner rather than later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2172)|
| 0:36:18| It's a pleasure for the Tennessee State Employees Association to share any research that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2178)|
| 0:36:23| and the one thing that I would like to thank you, Commissioner, for bringing to light is the sooner versus later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2183)|
| 0:36:28| because currently at this point we're dealing with January 1st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2188)|
| 0:36:32| because based on what the commissioner of the department has stated to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| he will stop admissions January 1st and has the power to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2195)|
| 0:36:40| So if admissions are stopped with no long-term plan that everyone in this room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2200)|
| 0:36:45| and the state legislature and the governor all understand to truly be able to benefit those that are currently being served,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2205)|
| 0:36:51| we're headed into some rough waters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2211)|
| 0:36:54| So the main thing here, again, is just awareness and getting everything out there that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2214)|
| 0:37:00| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2220)|
| 0:37:01| We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2221)|
| 0:37:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2222)|
| 0:37:03| Commissioners, we're going to pardon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2223)|
| 0:37:04| Commissioner Wombe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2224)|
| 0:37:05| Sorry, just one quick statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2225)|
| 0:37:06| Lisa, I want to thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| It's been a pleasure in the last week to work with you on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2228)|
| 0:37:14| This was brought to our attention by Commissioner Varney via e-mail the evening before a holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2234)|
| 0:37:21| Veterans Holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| And the employees didn't even know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2243)|
| 0:37:26| That is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| And the thing is, is these patients will not, they get turned down from these facilities already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2248)|
| 0:37:35| These are the worst of the worst out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2257)|
| 0:37:38| And Lakeshore has provided for over a century service to these patients to this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2258)|
| 0:37:46| And we have been working together and we will continue to work together to try to do what we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2266)|
| 0:37:53| because these patients are going to end up on the streets, in our neighborhoods, under our bridges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2273)|
| 0:37:59| and that is immoral to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2282)|
| 0:38:03| So I will work with you as well as the state legislature and do what we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2283)|
| 0:38:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2287)|
| 0:38:08| Try to make sure that this transition is done as easily and as painless to these patients as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2288)|
| 0:38:15| And I will be here for a little while and I'll be glad to help any commissioner if they have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2295)|
| 0:38:19| Again, this is a learning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| As Commissioner Orme stated, we have just begun learning the last ten days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2301)|
| 0:38:26| And so it's definitely a learning process at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2306)|
| 0:38:30| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2310)|
| 0:38:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2311)|
| 0:38:32| Commissioners, we're going to take about a five-minute break just to kind of transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2312)|
| 0:38:36| And we'll be back at, let's say, 2.20 and we'll get started with our regular agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2316)|
| 0:38:40| So we'll be back in about eight minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2320)|
| 0:38:41| I'd like to call to order the November session of the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2321)|
| 0:38:45| Clerk, if you'd call the roll, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2325)|
| 0:38:47| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2327)|
| 0:38:48| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2328)|
| 0:38:49| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2331)|
| 0:38:52| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2332)|
| 0:38:53| Commissioner Ormby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2333)|
| 0:38:54| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2334)|
| 0:38:55| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2335)|
| 0:38:56| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2336)|
| 0:38:57| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2337)|
| 0:38:58| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2338)|
| 0:38:59| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2339)|
| 0:39:00| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2340)|
| 0:39:01| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2341)|
| 0:39:02| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2342)|
| 0:39:03| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2343)|
| 0:39:04| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2344)|
| 0:39:05| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2345)|
| 0:39:06| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2346)|
| 0:39:07| We have a quorum present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2347)|
| 0:39:08| Our devotional will be led by Commissioner Sam McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2348)|
| 0:39:11| Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2351)|
| 0:39:14| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2354)|
| 0:39:16| This is a pretty sad time in the McKenzie household in that my aunt, our dear loved one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2356)|
| 0:39:24| passed on Saturday in Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2364)|
| 0:39:29| She was the matriarch of our family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2369)|
| 0:39:35| My family thinks that I went down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2375)|
| 0:39:36| She actually died while I was there in the room with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2376)|
| 0:39:40| Part of me thinks that she may have been waiting on me to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2380)|
| 0:39:45| In times like this, it kind of takes you back and makes you, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2385)|
| 0:39:52| kind of go back to your strong rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2392)|
| 0:39:55| What are the things that we count on in this fragile life?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2395)|
| 0:40:02| I'm always reminded of 1 Thessalonians, 5th chapter, 16th verses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2402)|
| 0:40:10| one of the shortest verses in the Bible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| It just tells you to rejoice always.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| As you ponder on that, how do you get to that point of being able to rejoice always?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2415)|
| 0:40:25| Nothing on the other side of all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| You go to the 17th verse, and it says, pray without ceasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2427)|
| 0:40:32| That's where I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2432)|
| 0:40:34| That's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2434)|
| 0:40:35| I'd like to ask you all, if you would, bow your heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| God of our weary years, God of our silent tears,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2438)|
| 0:40:44| thou who has brought us thus far on our way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2444)|
| 0:40:48| thou who has by thy might led us into the light,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2448)|
| 0:40:53| keep us forever on thy path, we pray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2453)|
| 0:40:59| Let's go to heaven, Father, with a humble and sad heart, Lord,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2459)|
| 0:41:03| that I come here today, Lord,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2463)|
| 0:41:06| that we come to this meeting, Lord,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2466)|
| 0:41:09| that great things be done in this meeting today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2469)|
| 0:41:12| that we all keep Knox County in our sights, Lord,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2472)|
| 0:41:15| that we all vote and discuss and comment on things that will be pleasing to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2475)|
| 0:41:23| and done in a way that is pleasing to you, Lord,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2483)|
| 0:41:26| and that at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=2486)|

| 0:50:10| Commissioners, I'd like to split this, if we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3010)|
| 0:50:11| If I could have a motion, first of all, on Mr. Raj Patel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3011)|
| 0:50:15| then we need to vote on the commission representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3015)|
| 0:50:18| Is there a motion to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3018)|
| 0:50:19| I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3019)|
| 0:50:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3020)|
| 0:50:21| Do we need to vote on splitting it, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3021)|
| 0:50:25| Yes, there are two different appointments. I would like for two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3025)|
| 0:50:27| Is it okay that we all those in favor of splitting it say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3027)|
| 0:50:30| I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3030)|
| 0:50:31| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3031)|
| 0:50:32| And this question, I guess, just gets to the board makeup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3032)|
| 0:50:38| And to be quite honest, I will look to our commission members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3038)|
| 0:50:42| I don't know how many we have members that's on the board, to maybe answer this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3042)|
| 0:50:47| You know, generally with boards like this, it's good to have a balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3047)|
| 0:50:51| And I know Mr. Patel is maybe more of a business person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3051)|
| 0:50:57| You know, that's his kind of niche there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3057)|
| 0:51:00| So I didn't know if we'd, you know, what I don't want is in a couple years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3060)|
| 0:51:03| it's considered skewed one way, either too much community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3063)|
| 0:51:08| too many community advocates as opposed to business minded folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3068)|
| 0:51:12| So for that reason, I'm just questioning, and it's simply a question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3072)|
| 0:51:17| do we want to consider, and it may be what we do first, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3077)|
| 0:51:22| So, again, I'll let the Commissioner Briggs to kind of answer that question for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3082)|
| 0:51:26| You know, right now, the way the members are appointed there is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3086)|
| 0:51:30| the mayor gets to make an appointment, the ethics commission itself makes appointments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3090)|
| 0:51:36| I think the sheriff makes some, and the commission makes some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3096)|
| 0:51:40| And, you know, I think the opportunity for balance is there in several places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3100)|
| 0:51:45| is if the ethics committee itself sees that there's an imbalance there, we'll try to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3105)|
| 0:51:50| I don't think those discussions have come up too much about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3110)|
| 0:51:53| business versus non-business because of the issues that's come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3113)|
| 0:51:58| But it would give the, if there is an imbalance there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3118)|
| 0:52:01| and it's someone that are coming actually to the commission appointments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3121)|
| 0:52:04| then I think we would have, by we I mean I'm speaking as a member of the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3124)|
| 0:52:08| would have the opportunity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3128)|
| 0:52:11| And if the ethics committee felt themselves that there was an imbalance there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3131)|
| 0:52:14| they would have the opportunity to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3134)|
| 0:52:17| You know, I would expect that the sheriff and the mayor are, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3137)|
| 0:52:21| are picking, you know, people that they want to pick, whatever their reasons are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3141)|
| 0:52:25| But, you know, I see the points you're trying to make, but I think that's part of the reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3145)|
| 0:52:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3149)|
| 0:52:30| While we have so many entities that are making that, those appointments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3150)|
| 0:52:34| that it gives a chance to get different perspectives on what the balance should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3154)|
| 0:52:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3158)|
| 0:52:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3159)|
| 0:52:40| So the motion on the floor is to split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3160)|
| 0:52:41| This is not to vote on Mr. Patel, but rather to split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3161)|
| 0:52:44| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3164)|
| 0:52:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3165)|
| 0:52:46| It is a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3166)|
| 0:52:47| So is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3167)|
| 0:52:48| Motion to approve Mr. Patel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3168)|
| 0:52:49| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3169)|
| 0:52:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3170)|
| 0:52:51| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3171)|
| 0:52:52| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3172)|
| 0:52:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3173)|
| 0:52:54| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3174)|
| 0:52:55| Here, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3175)|
| 0:52:56| Is Mr. Patel here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3176)|
| 0:52:57| He is back there, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3177)|
| 0:52:59| Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3179)|
| 0:53:00| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3180)|
| 0:53:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3181)|
| 0:53:02| We appreciate your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3182)|
| 0:53:03| This is the appointment from this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3183)|
| 0:53:08| The way we will do this is that we have had people come before the commission at the workshop session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3188)|
| 0:53:13| to interview for these or to present their qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3193)|
| 0:53:16| We'll start in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3196)|
| 0:53:17| If you have someone you would like to nominate, we will go through each of the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3197)|
| 0:53:22| If you have someone to nominate for the ethics committee, if we have more than one nomination, we will vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3202)|
| 0:53:27| If we have several, the person that receives the lowest vote, if no one gets six votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3207)|
| 0:53:33| the person with the lowest will drop off and we will continue voting until someone gets six votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3213)|
| 0:53:37| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3217)|
| 0:53:38| Mr. Chairman, the person that's rolling off, were they term limited?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3218)|
| 0:53:43| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3223)|
| 0:53:44| Is that person here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3224)|
| 0:53:47| Yes, Ms. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3227)|
| 0:53:48| Yes, Ms. Smith is not term limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3228)|
| 0:53:52| Mr. Chairman, I believe there was an e-mail out floating around that she had requested, as a trained member of the ethics committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3232)|
| 0:54:01| that she be reappointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3241)|
| 0:54:03| And I don't believe she understood that we were reviewing those applications at the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3243)|
| 0:54:10| If we might, I would like for her to introduce herself so that she might be considered for reappointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3250)|
| 0:54:20| Without objection, Ms. Smith, would you like to come forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3260)|
| 0:54:27| If you could take a couple of minutes and introduce yourself to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3267)|
| 0:54:32| Thank you and good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3272)|
| 0:54:34| Dr. Karen Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3274)|
| 0:54:35| My address is 6816 LeChristoway in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3275)|
| 0:54:39| My background and training is in applied ethics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3279)|
| 0:54:42| recently receiving my doctoral degree in applied ethics from the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3282)|
| 0:54:47| My interest in maintaining my position on the ethics committee is just that I believe that as service to our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3287)|
| 0:54:55| that it behooves us to have someone trained in professional ethics on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3295)|
| 0:55:00| When we hear these issues, if we are looking at issues to understand the principles underlying ethical decision-making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3300)|
| 0:55:08| and how we could address our recommendations with a background that shows clear, concise justification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3308)|
| 0:55:19| for what sort of comments we push forward to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3319)|
| 0:55:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3325)|
| 0:55:26| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3326)|
| 0:55:27| I'd like to make a statement in sort of layman terms about why I think Karen is an excellent choice for reappointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3327)|
| 0:55:35| And it deals with the type of person I think that's good on the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3335)|
| 0:55:38| First of all, she is a trained ethicist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| And we have other people who have been dealing with most of their careers with ethics also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3340)|
| 0:55:45| but I think she's a good addition that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3345)|
| 0:55:48| She really doesn't have any conflicts of interest or any connection with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3348)|
| 0:55:53| I think that's a very strong positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| And she's made herself available to attend the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3355)|
| 0:55:58| Fortunately, we really haven't had much come up in the last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3358)|
| 0:56:01| which I think speaks a lot to our new county government and how we're trying to run things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3361)|
| 0:56:07| But I would really like to endorse and support, and it will probably get to me first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3367)|
| 0:56:12| but I'm going to nominate you as we're coming around here for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3372)|
| 0:56:17| The unfortunate part of this is that we've had some excellent, excellent candidates on the last few appointments that we've made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3377)|
| 0:56:26| And, you know, I just wish we could keep all of these people involved in county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3386)|
| 0:56:33| I remember when we couldn't get anyone that any of us would really want to serve on these committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3393)|
| 0:56:38| because I think people felt like they didn't want to waste their time or they really didn't make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3398)|
| 0:56:43| And today, for people who want to serve and come down here and serve, you do make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3403)|
| 0:56:48| And I think it speaks a lot to where we are right now with our government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3408)|
| 0:56:53| And I'd like to thank Karen, first of all, for the service that she's given to the county so far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3413)|
| 0:56:58| and I hope we'll give her serious consideration because I think she's just an excellent candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3418)|
| 0:57:02| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3422)|
| 0:57:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3424)|
| 0:57:05| Dr. Smith, on the Ethics Committee, do you see any changes that need to be made, or how do you think it's going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3425)|
| 0:57:12| As Commissioner Briggs brought up, we haven't had much come before us in my last year serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3432)|
| 0:57:19| We had one issue that it was even questionable whether that was an appropriate issue to come before us or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3439)|
| 0:57:24| We spent a lot of time discussing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3444)|
| 0:57:26| I think we do, as he said, have a very involved and committed committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3446)|
| 0:57:31| Things coming to us has been slow, and I don't know whether that's an issue of there not being anything out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3451)|
| 0:57:38| or people misunderstanding what sort of help and assistance we may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3458)|
| 0:57:43| I know that Commissioner Briggs brought forth some ideas on how we might help our city, government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3463)|
| 0:57:48| and county on being proactive and saying that if you question something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3468)|
| 0:57:52| and you're questioning something beforehand, that perhaps you should bring it to us before an action is taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3472)|
| 0:57:58| and that the County Ethics Committee may serve our community better in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3478)|
| 0:58:02| I'm glad to hear that you've been issues out before it's even come, so that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3482)|
| 0:58:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3487)|
| 0:58:08| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3488)|
| 0:58:09| Yes, I need a little clarification again about at our meeting last week when we heard everyone speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3489)|
| 0:58:19| It was my understanding that this was for a term-limited position, so apparently it's not for a term-limited position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3499)|
| 0:58:25| I think it was another appointment we asked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3505)|
| 0:58:27| It was a personnel committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3507)|
| 0:58:29| Personnel board was term-limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3509)|
| 0:58:30| Term-limited, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3510)|
| 0:58:31| And so can you explain to me again that you were not aware that you were up for reappointment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3511)|
| 0:58:40| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3520)|
| 0:58:41| I really had understood that I was completing my predecessor's term when I was given the seat that I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3521)|
| 0:58:49| I was not advised that I needed to come to a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3529)|
| 0:58:52| I had submitted an email letter to the Commission Chair saying I was interested in reappointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3532)|
| 0:58:57| if it would serve the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| And then Commissioner Wright contacted me after your last meeting to say you weren't here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3539)|
| 0:59:05| and I said, oh, my gosh, I've, you know, so apologized to the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3545)|
| 0:59:08| I had no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3548)|
| 0:59:09| And how were you appointed last time and whose term did you finish out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3549)|
| 0:59:16| I received a letter from Mr. Jarrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3556)|
| 0:59:21| I think somebody had not been able to complete their term or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3561)|
| 0:59:26| It may have been when she filed for Senate when one of the members resigned that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3566)|
| 0:59:32| And did this body appoint Dr. Smith at that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3572)|
| 0:59:36| It did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3576)|
| 0:59:41| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3581)|
| 0:59:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3582)|
| 0:59:43| So we'll start in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3583)|
| 0:59:44| Do you have someone you'd like to nominate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3584)|
| 0:59:45| And each commissioner will have an opportunity to nominate someone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3585)|
| 0:59:47| and then we'll begin the voting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3587)|
| 0:59:49| Let's begin in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3589)|
| 0:59:51| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3591)|
| 0:59:55| I'll make a statement before I introduce a name, and that is I would ask that commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3595)|
| 1:00:02| once we find this information out, that we get it out sooner than, you know, 235 or 236.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3602)|
| 1:00:09| This kind of, you know, throws me all askew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3609)|
| 1:00:13| You know, we've had a long process, and I've actually, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3613)|
| 1:00:17| deliberated over the names that were before me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3617)|
| 1:00:21| Now, to be quite honest, I mean, I know Dr. Smith is definitely a qualified candidate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3621)|
| 1:00:27| and maybe she'll win, but this is the 11th hour for this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3627)|
| 1:00:32| So somehow, someway, form or whatever, we, you know, this will be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3632)|
| 1:00:40| and I guess maybe the law director, I won't even ask him to opine on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3640)|
| 1:00:43| I just think this is unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3643)|
| 1:00:47| This is, you know, this is last minute because I have a name, and I would like to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3647)|
| 1:00:53| because as Dr. Briggs said, we had some extremely qualified candidates in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3653)|
| 1:00:58| So with that said, I'll nominate Chuck Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3658)|
| 1:01:09| Commissioner Burrells?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3669)|
| 1:01:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3671)|
| 1:01:12| I'm going to say basically the same thing that Sam did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3672)|
| 1:01:18| I'm sorry that I'm just finding out now about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3678)|
| 1:01:22| I wish that we had been made aware of this before today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3682)|
| 1:01:25| It's obvious, I think, reading the tea leaves what's about to happen here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3685)|
| 1:01:30| and I think that Dr. Smith is very qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3690)|
| 1:01:33| She's done an excellent job on the ethics committee, and I'd be delighted to see her serve again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3693)|
| 1:01:40| But, guys, I'm going to stress this once again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3700)|
| 1:01:43| Process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3703)|
| 1:01:45| This commission is not doing a good job when it comes to process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3705)|
| 1:01:50| and we need to tighten it up and do a better job for our constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3710)|
| 1:01:55| So I'm going to pass on a nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3715)|
| 1:02:04| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3724)|
| 1:02:07| I'm not going to say anything but nominate somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3727)|
| 1:02:09| Steve Drevick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3729)|
| 1:02:12| Drevick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3732)|
| 1:02:19| Commissioner Warmbier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3739)|
| 1:02:21| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3741)|
| 1:02:24| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3744)|
| 1:02:25| You know, I will make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3745)|
| 1:02:27| My nominee is going to be Karen Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3747)|
| 1:02:29| But it was a couple of weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3749)|
| 1:02:31| It's not truly an eleventh hour because she did send an e-mail to every one of the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3751)|
| 1:02:37| that she wanted to be considered for nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3757)|
| 1:02:40| She may not have been here at the hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3760)|
| 1:02:42| but she did put the information out that she was interested in this a couple of weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3762)|
| 1:02:48| But Karen Smith is my nominee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3768)|
| 1:02:51| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3771)|
| 1:02:52| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3772)|
| 1:02:55| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3775)|
| 1:02:56| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3776)|
| 1:02:57| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3777)|
| 1:02:58| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3778)|
| 1:02:59| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3779)|
| 1:03:01| I would like to make a comment before I pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3781)|
| 1:03:05| and that is every position, every appointment that we have made since I've sat in this chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3785)|
| 1:03:12| we have allowed anybody at the last minute to come and apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3792)|
| 1:03:17| And if you'll confirm that with Tank Strickland, anybody else that's been sitting here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3797)|
| 1:03:22| we don't cut it off and say there are going to be no more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3802)|
| 1:03:25| We have added people at the last 11th hour more than once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3805)|
| 1:03:29| So pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3809)|
| 1:03:31| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3811)|
| 1:03:32| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3812)|
| 1:03:33| Commissioner Shouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3813)|
| 1:03:35| I was planning on voting for one of the people who spoke at our workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3815)|
| 1:03:41| or our interview process the other day, but I will pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3821)|
| 1:03:47| and I appreciate Dr. Briggs's recommendation and the information presented to us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3827)|
| 1:03:53| I'll pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3833)|
| 1:03:56| We have three nominees, Chuck Williams, Steve Drevick, and Karen Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3836)|
| 1:04:02| So we will begin the voting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3842)|
| 1:04:04| If one individual gets six, then that person is selected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3844)|
| 1:04:08| If not, we will drop off the person with the lowest vote total and vote on the next two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3848)|
| 1:04:14| Let's begin the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3854)|

| 1:05:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3905)|
| 1:05:06| Commissioner, the reason I passed is I work with Miss Smith's husband.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3906)|
| 1:05:08| I feel like it would be a conflict for me to vote, so I will not be voting on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3908)|
| 1:05:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3912)|
| 1:05:13| Williams received two, Drevick two, Smith six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3913)|
| 1:05:17| The vote is Smith six, Drevick two, and Williams two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3917)|
| 1:05:21| So Dr. Smith is reappointed to the Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3921)|
| 1:05:29| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3929)|
| 1:06:00| We're on page seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3960)|
| 1:06:08| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3968)|
| 1:06:11| determined the method of disposal of property located at 7601 Water Tower Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3971)|
| 1:06:15| next to South Doyle High School to be by seal bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3975)|
| 1:06:18| This is resolution 803.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3978)|
| 1:06:20| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3980)|
| 1:06:21| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3981)|
| 1:06:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3982)|
| 1:06:23| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3983)|
| 1:06:25| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3985)|
| 1:06:26| Hugh, is there going to be a minimum bid for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3986)|
| 1:06:28| Yeah, $121,000 is the minimum bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3988)|
| 1:06:31| Of course, the property appraised at $140,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3991)|
| 1:06:33| But we're at least getting our costs back and everything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3993)|
| 1:06:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3995)|
| 1:06:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3996)|
| 1:06:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3997)|
| 1:06:38| Name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3998)|
| 1:06:39| Hugh Holt, 1,000 North Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=3999)|
| 1:06:41| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4001)|
| 1:06:42| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4002)|
| 1:06:43| I would just like to say that I'm proud of the students at South Doyle who built this house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4003)|
| 1:06:48| I mean, building trades is one of the things that have been taken out of a lot of our schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4008)|
| 1:06:53| and we have a lot of kids going through school today that are not college material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4013)|
| 1:06:58| We're going to have to train them somehow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4018)|
| 1:06:59| and I think we've done a great job in working with them on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4019)|
| 1:07:04| It's a beautiful house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4024)|
| 1:07:05| If you get a chance, it's right on the corner right there by the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4025)|
| 1:07:08| So get a chance to go look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4028)|

| 1:07:22| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knott's County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4042)|
| 1:07:24| amending Knott's County Commission rules to add a new section to address public notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4044)|
| 1:07:28| and other requirements for commission meetings other than regularly scheduled notice public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4048)|
| 1:07:34| This is Resolution 903.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4054)|
| 1:07:36| Motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4056)|
| 1:07:37| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4057)|
| 1:07:38| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4058)|
| 1:07:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4059)|
| 1:07:40| Motion is made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4060)|
| 1:07:41| Commissioner Burwells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4061)|
| 1:07:46| Yes, and this had all the amendments that we agreed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4066)|
| 1:07:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4070)|
| 1:07:51| I'm going to bring up, again, one thing that we discussed in Rules Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4071)|
| 1:07:56| which didn't get discussed in the entire commission that I think is worthy of a little more discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4076)|
| 1:08:03| and that is the issue of regularly scheduled meetings versus chance encounters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4083)|
| 1:08:10| And I think we all agree chance encounters are running into each other at the grocery store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4090)|
| 1:08:15| or at a holiday party or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4095)|
| 1:08:21| but I have a really hard time swallowing that a regularly scheduled meeting of a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4101)|
| 1:08:32| or political group whose purpose is to discuss either county business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4112)|
| 1:08:39| or anything else that comes before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4119)|
| 1:08:43| I have a really hard time accepting that as a chance meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4123)|
| 1:08:48| especially when there are so many of us who attend these sorts of meetings on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4128)|
| 1:08:56| Ethically, I feel like in terms of how we've always been instructed by our law director to err on the side of caution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4136)|
| 1:09:06| when it comes to the sunshine and public notices, the sunshine law and public notices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4146)|
| 1:09:13| We've always been urged to err on the side of caution and to notice anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4153)|
| 1:09:21| if you think that another commissioner is going to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4161)|
| 1:09:25| So I think that any meeting of whether it's Knox County Democratic Board of Governors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4165)|
| 1:09:33| or the Power Publican Club or the Council of West Knox County Homeowners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4173)|
| 1:09:38| especially if they're going to be discussing something like the hillside and ridgetop protection plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4178)|
| 1:09:43| or something like that, if there's going to be more than one commissioner there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4183)|
| 1:09:47| And, guys, we all know who's going to be there and who's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4187)|
| 1:09:52| We sit around and talk about it in meetings like this and in our luncheons about who was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4192)|
| 1:10:01| Then those things need to be noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4201)|
| 1:10:04| And I appreciate that the media is often there and often reports on those sorts of things, but that's after the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4204)|
| 1:10:12| So I think that that's something that we need to discuss a little bit further before we just accept this wholesale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4212)|
| 1:10:20| I know that ethically, for me, whichever way we decide to go on this, for me, ethically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4220)|
| 1:10:26| I will continue to notice any meeting where I think more than one of us is going to show up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4226)|
| 1:10:31| because I think that's what we are expected to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4231)|
| 1:10:34| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4234)|
| 1:10:37| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4237)|
| 1:10:38| And I guess this is just a, you know, this resolution is, I guess, came out of a, you know, four-hour window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4238)|
| 1:10:46| Ex-Commissioner Burroughs was four hours short on a notice meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4246)|
| 1:10:52| So I guess what I'm trying to understand is, are we talking about meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4252)|
| 1:11:01| Are we talking about deliberations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4261)|
| 1:11:03| And the reason I ask that is, I mean, if I'm asked to speak to the Boyd Cloud Democrats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4263)|
| 1:11:12| or Commissioner Smith is asked to speak to the Fountain City Republicans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4272)|
| 1:11:15| and he renders a, hey, this, you know, this resolution that I sponsored, you know, five years ago has come back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4275)|
| 1:11:23| and I'm glad about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4283)|
| 1:11:26| Has he just deliberated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4286)|
| 1:11:28| You know, I guess, you know, are we going to, and this is, again, an abundance of caution that we want to ensure ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4288)|
| 1:11:37| that we've not broken the Sunshine Law or any events, you know, tentacles that reach out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4297)|
| 1:11:45| then why wouldn't we notice meetings like that is my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4305)|
| 1:11:52| Why not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4312)|
| 1:11:54| You know, I didn't necessarily go there, go to the Democratic-Republican Club to deliberate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4314)|
| 1:12:02| but I do know we're asked questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4322)|
| 1:12:05| I know the ones I go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4325)|
| 1:12:06| I'm often asked questions and opinions and my view of this or that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4326)|
| 1:12:13| as I'm sure every commissioner and mayor and councilperson has done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4333)|
| 1:12:18| So, I mean, if we're going to go with this thing, to me, I think this is a, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4338)|
| 1:12:24| killing the flea with a sledgehammer, but if that's where we're going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4344)|
| 1:12:27| then we've got to make sure that we are noticing all of these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4347)|
| 1:12:33| And I do know there's another process that the IT department has in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4353)|
| 1:12:38| but I think everything needs to go into that within 48 hours into a system where it's disseminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4358)|
| 1:12:45| So I'll ask the law director to maybe comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4365)|
| 1:12:50| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4370)|
| 1:12:51| Oh, not at all, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4371)|
| 1:12:52| I mean, if you recall during the ethics update I gave you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4372)|
| 1:12:54| I've always advised that if two or more of you know you're going to be at a meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4374)|
| 1:12:58| and there's a potential for deliberating or discussing something that the commission is about to vote on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4378)|
| 1:13:04| err in favor of noticing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4384)|
| 1:13:06| I mean, I've consistently said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4386)|
| 1:13:08| Social events, et cetera, not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4388)|
| 1:13:11| But if you know specifically you're going to a specific meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4391)|
| 1:13:15| you know a colleague is going to be there on the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4395)|
| 1:13:17| you know that issue is going to come before the commission, you're advised to notice it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4397)|
| 1:13:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4403)|
| 1:13:25| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4405)|
| 1:13:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4407)|
| 1:13:28| Two points there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4408)|
| 1:13:30| Number one, the regular meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4410)|
| 1:13:36| If each of those members knows it's a regular meeting, so does each of the press, TVs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4416)|
| 1:13:41| anybody who has access or wants access knows when those meetings are if they choose to show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4421)|
| 1:13:47| Number two, we can discuss all we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4427)|
| 1:13:52| We just can't deliberate without public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4432)|
| 1:13:56| Discussion, you know, that's a fast day for clarification on something I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4436)|
| 1:14:02| Is that deliberation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4442)|
| 1:14:04| No, that's discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4444)|
| 1:14:05| I'm not telling how I'm going to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4445)|
| 1:14:07| I just want to know what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4447)|
| 1:14:10| So you've got to look at those two differences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4450)|
| 1:14:12| Don't kill that flea with a sledgehammer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4452)|
| 1:14:16| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4456)|
| 1:14:18| I want clarification from the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4458)|
| 1:14:20| Just I plan, depending on what time we get out of here tonight, I plan to go to a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4460)|
| 1:14:25| After we vote on these issues, we can update the community about what we have already taken action on, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4465)|
| 1:14:33| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4473)|
| 1:14:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4474)|
| 1:14:35| Mr. Hornby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4475)|
| 1:14:38| Yes, I said it during the rules meeting when we had it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4478)|
| 1:14:42| I go to the West Nostra Republican Club every third Thursday of every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4482)|
| 1:14:48| It's known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4488)|
| 1:14:50| Dave Wright shows up, Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4490)|
| 1:14:53| R. Larry showed up a few times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4493)|
| 1:14:55| Other commissioners show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4495)|
| 1:14:57| I never discuss anything with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4497)|
| 1:14:59| I never deliberate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4499)|
| 1:15:00| I do tell the citizens that I'm meeting with, as well as West Hills Neighborhood Association when I go to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4500)|
| 1:15:09| I tell what's coming up on the agenda, and I ask for their viewpoints and their concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4509)|
| 1:15:16| Never have I said to Commissioner Smith or Commissioner Wright or anybody else, how are you voting on something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4516)|
| 1:15:24| And that's what it gets down to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4524)|
| 1:15:26| It's not deliberation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4526)|
| 1:15:28| If we publicly notice this meeting, then I've got to take notes, and I've got to document everybody that's there in this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4528)|
| 1:15:41| The thing is, is we're not deliberating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4541)|
| 1:15:43| We're going to a meeting where we like to hear what the citizens have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4543)|
| 1:15:48| I don't know if Mr. Wright's going to show up every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4548)|
| 1:15:50| I don't know if Mr. Smith or anybody else is going to show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4550)|
| 1:15:54| So how do I publicly notice a meeting if I don't know for sure they're going to be there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4554)|
| 1:16:00| It's kind of like I'd have to wait until the last minute, and then I'm not given the 48 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4560)|
| 1:16:05| I think we're trying to read too much into this, and we're overthinking this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4565)|
| 1:16:12| and we're going to go on a slippery slope where we're going to be publicly noticing everything that we move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4572)|
| 1:16:21| And I just think it's a bad idea to public notice those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4581)|
| 1:16:26| I mean, I trust Amy's ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4586)|
| 1:16:28| I trust my ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4588)|
| 1:16:29| I'm not going to discuss anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4589)|
| 1:16:31| If she says she didn't discuss anything in her meeting, I believe her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4591)|
| 1:16:34| That's between her and her ethics, whether she kept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4594)|
| 1:16:39| So I think we're going down a slippery slope if we add more to this than it needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4599)|
| 1:16:46| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4606)|
| 1:16:49| Whether or not we think the public knows that there's a regularly scheduled meeting happening or not is not the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4609)|
| 1:16:56| Obviously, there are people who know that the West Knox Council of homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4616)|
| 1:17:02| or West Knox County Council of homeowners, and I keep bringing them up because that's one that sticks in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4622)|
| 1:17:07| There are a lot of others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4627)|
| 1:17:09| There are those who realize that they meet on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4629)|
| 1:17:13| There are others who do not realize that they meet on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4633)|
| 1:17:16| And so whether or not we think the public knows or not, that's really not the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4636)|
| 1:17:20| The point is whether or not we're complying with the spirit of this legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4640)|
| 1:17:25| If you want to start talking about discussion versus deliberation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4645)|
| 1:17:29| I think we can all agree that in hardly any of these meetings except the ones we have right here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4649)|
| 1:17:34| we do not deliberate, we discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4654)|
| 1:17:36| However, we have been instructed by our law director out of abundance of caution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4656)|
| 1:17:41| since it might be interpreted differently by someone who happens to pass by and see us speaking together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4661)|
| 1:17:48| that we should go ahead and notice it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4668)|
| 1:17:52| We've also we covered this in the last one of Jeff's concerns that if there's, you know, if you're the only one there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4672)|
| 1:17:59| you don't have to take notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4679)|
| 1:18:01| And if there is another commissioner there and you do have to take notes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4681)|
| 1:18:05| and you have to make note of who's there, well, you know, that's part of the job of being a commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4685)|
| 1:18:12| You know, as far as taking the time to publicly notice meetings, in 2011,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4692)|
| 1:18:21| in which you're all aware of what my health issues have been, I've still managed to notice 34 public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4701)|
| 1:18:31| It's not that difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4711)|
| 1:18:33| It doesn't take that much time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4713)|
| 1:18:35| It's not hard to write down who's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4715)|
| 1:18:37| It's not hard to make a quick notation of what was discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4717)|
| 1:18:42| And most of the time I meet with Commissioner Hammond on a fairly regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4722)|
| 1:18:49| And the main reason I meet with him is because he and his wife, Viv, are excellent parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4729)|
| 1:18:54| They've done a fabulous job raising their family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4734)|
| 1:18:57| And when I have a parenting issue, I often ask Commissioner Hammond to have breakfast with me so that I can ask for his advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4737)|
| 1:19:06| But I always notice it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4746)|
| 1:19:07| I always notice it because invariably someone is going to walk by and see the two of us sitting together talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4747)|
| 1:19:14| And if it's not noticed, then we could really open up a can of worms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4754)|
| 1:19:20| So, again, I'm going to make a motion that we add an amendment that any regularly scheduled meeting that we go to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4760)|
| 1:19:31| that it's possible for another commissioner to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4771)|
| 1:19:36| And you guys know what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4776)|
| 1:19:38| We're talking about regularly scheduled community meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4778)|
| 1:19:42| We're talking about regularly scheduled political meetings, that they be included in our public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4782)|
| 1:19:48| This is an opportunity for us to tell the public how serious we are about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4788)|
| 1:19:54| Is this just a jab at somebody for missing a four-hour mark, or are we serious about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4794)|
| 1:20:02| So that is my amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4802)|
| 1:20:08| Is there a second to the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4808)|
| 1:20:11| Could you restate what the amendment is exactly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4811)|
| 1:20:16| Well, no, actually it's just an amendment to the current motion that we include regularly scheduled community and political meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4816)|
| 1:20:29| And I'm not talking about a meeting that happens once every three months or twice a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4829)|
| 1:20:33| I'm talking about a meeting that happens every month that commissioners regularly attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4833)|
| 1:20:41| We all know what kind of meetings we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4841)|
| 1:20:44| Do we just need to make a list of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4844)|
| 1:20:46| You mean just make a list of those and those are published every month saying that these commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4846)|
| 1:20:52| there may be more than one commissioner there, is that what you're referring to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4852)|
| 1:20:54| I think that would be an excellent idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4854)|
| 1:20:57| And then it would just be sort of like a standing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4857)|
| 1:21:00| I think that would be an excellent idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4860)|
| 1:21:02| I think that's just exactly like what we do with the beer board, with task force on justice issues, any of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4862)|
| 1:21:10| You know, I'll go ahead and second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4870)|
| 1:21:12| I think it will save trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4872)|
| 1:21:13| And we can pick a list of those, whether it's the South Doyle or all the Republican clubs, the Democratic clubs, the council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4873)|
| 1:21:20| the West Knox homeowners, you know, whatever, and just make a list of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4880)|
| 1:21:23| and say more than one commissioner may be present at those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4883)|
| 1:21:27| And that will cover a lot of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4887)|
| 1:21:29| And then the ones that we – I mean, because if we both show up, somebody is going to complain, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4889)|
| 1:21:34| And then if we have some special meeting where, you know, for instance, like you sometimes do on Thursday afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4894)|
| 1:21:41| As a matter of fact, you can make that a regularly scheduled meeting, too, if you wanted to, there at the Time Warp Tea Room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4901)|
| 1:21:47| Then that would cover a lot of these things where there may otherwise be some sort of accidental encounter that could be questioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4907)|
| 1:21:54| So I'll go ahead and second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4914)|
| 1:21:56| Thank you, Doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4916)|
| 1:21:57| That will be in the form of a substitute motion because the amendment, it has to be accepted by the person that made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4917)|
| 1:22:04| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4924)|
| 1:22:06| You made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4926)|
| 1:22:07| Would you be willing to accept it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4927)|
| 1:22:08| So is that a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4928)|
| 1:22:10| Sure, that we include everything in the original motion plus what Dr. Briggs included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4930)|
| 1:22:17| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4937)|
| 1:22:19| You know, I don't like this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4939)|
| 1:22:24| I think the amendment does something to clean it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4944)|
| 1:22:31| I agree with Commissioner Brown and Commissioner Owenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4951)|
| 1:22:38| This is not broken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4958)|
| 1:22:41| Why is this before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4961)|
| 1:22:42| Why is this whole thing before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4962)|
| 1:22:45| We need to do away with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4965)|
| 1:22:47| We need to understand the past but quit reliving the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4967)|
| 1:22:53| We're not the commission of Black Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4973)|
| 1:22:56| We're nowhere near that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4976)|
| 1:22:58| We still keep introducing these things and using Black, I'm not saying that this one in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4978)|
| 1:23:05| but we keep doing it in the spirit of, well, we've got to make sure that we're, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4985)|
| 1:23:09| that we've cleaned our glass and there's no tin in it and we're even more transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4989)|
| 1:23:14| This will never end unless we end it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4994)|
| 1:23:19| We're doing a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=4999)|
| 1:23:22| Anyone with the press, just track the number of press releases that's been out from the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5002)|
| 1:23:30| Commissioners Briggs, Wright, and myself has been on this body three years after and three years before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5010)|
| 1:23:39| We probably got more in one month than they probably had in a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5019)|
| 1:23:43| We're doing a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5023)|
| 1:23:45| Why are we introducing Resolution 903?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5025)|
| 1:23:50| We should not be introducing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5030)|
| 1:23:52| We should say, you all know what we're doing at the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5032)|
| 1:23:56| We're doing what Commissioner Orenby said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5036)|
| 1:23:59| We're bringing issues forward just to let folks know, hey, this is what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5039)|
| 1:24:04| Commissioner Wright and I are both regular attendees at the town hall East meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5044)|
| 1:24:08| I mean, they may ask him, hey, what's going on, and Carter, he'll talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5048)|
| 1:24:14| Ask me what's going on and how I'll talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5054)|
| 1:24:17| So, you know, for us to keep introducing these little things, I think it just doesn't speak to the amount of progress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5057)|
| 1:24:27| that we've made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5067)|
| 1:24:28| So, you know, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5068)|
| 1:24:32| This resolution, the add-on, is it ticky-tack?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5072)|
| 1:24:36| Yep, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5076)|
| 1:24:38| But if we're going to do it, we've got to add this resolution to save it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5078)|
| 1:24:42| We've got to make sure that we're above board and transparent and not do this when we know that there's two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5082)|
| 1:24:49| or three or four commissioners going to a meeting and that some things could deliberate would be disingenuous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5089)|
| 1:24:55| in my humble opinion, if we're going to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5095)|
| 1:24:59| And I'm saying we shouldn't do any of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5099)|
| 1:25:01| I'm saying we're fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5101)|
| 1:25:02| I'm saying we're fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5102)|
| 1:25:03| I'm saying, look, if you're with the press, look at the amount of press releases that you get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5103)|
| 1:25:09| They're complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5109)|
| 1:25:11| They're whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5111)|
| 1:25:12| They're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5112)|
| 1:25:13| We're open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5113)|
| 1:25:14| We're up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5114)|
| 1:25:15| We're honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5115)|
| 1:25:16| But if we're going to do this, let's do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5116)|
| 1:25:18| And then we say, hey, we've got all of our bases covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5118)|
| 1:25:21| Like Commissioner Briggs said, you know, if someone wants to throw a stone here or there, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5121)|
| 1:25:26| we've done that at the beginning of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5126)|
| 1:25:29| Jolie has prepared a document that shows us when all the Democratic Club meetings are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5129)|
| 1:25:34| when all the Republican Club meetings are, when town hall leases are meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5134)|
| 1:25:38| when West Knox Council is meeting, when Beard and Business, whomever, are meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5138)|
| 1:25:42| Done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5142)|
| 1:25:44| Stick a fork in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5144)|
| 1:25:45| So I was going to vote against this resolution, but I will support the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5145)|
| 1:25:52| But if that should fail, hopefully, really I don't, you know, I won't say either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5152)|
| 1:25:58| If it passes or fails, I do think this resolution at its face is not where we're trying to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5158)|
| 1:26:05| So I just encourage us to consider what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5165)|
| 1:26:12| Are we being honest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5172)|
| 1:26:13| Are we being up front?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5173)|
| 1:26:14| Are we deliberating?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5174)|
| 1:26:15| I think the answer 1 through 11 is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5175)|
| 1:26:18| We're not deliberating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5178)|
| 1:26:19| We're not doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5179)|
| 1:26:20| I guarantee you that answer is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5180)|
| 1:26:23| So if the substitute motion fails, let's not pass this resolution as written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5183)|
| 1:26:30| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5190)|
| 1:26:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5191)|
| 1:26:33| I do not favor the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5193)|
| 1:26:36| I will be voting against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5196)|
| 1:26:38| And I would like to speak to the merits of the original motion when it comes back to the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5198)|
| 1:26:43| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5203)|
| 1:26:45| You know, I brought this as a way to set the standard high for us as a commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5205)|
| 1:26:53| And, you know, I brought it to the Rules Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5213)|
| 1:26:55| I went through the proper procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5215)|
| 1:26:58| We deliberated over it for over an hour, hour and a half in the Rules Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5218)|
| 1:27:01| and discussed it again a little bit in the workshop, not much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5221)|
| 1:27:05| But this is just to set the standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5225)|
| 1:27:06| The school system has the same standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5226)|
| 1:27:09| The school board has a rule in their rule book that says we shall not have a public meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5229)|
| 1:27:13| and that it's not noticed within 48 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5233)|
| 1:27:16| The law director has said there has been opinion that we need to have a 48-hour notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5236)|
| 1:27:23| that is adequate based on some court proceedings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5243)|
| 1:27:26| I'm just setting a standard that we would like to live up to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5246)|
| 1:27:29| If you don't want to live up to that standard, you know, I got season tickets to UT basketball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5249)|
| 1:27:34| Larry has UT basketball season tickets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5254)|
| 1:27:36| I see him every game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5256)|
| 1:27:38| So it's no longer a chance meeting because we both have season basketball tickets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5258)|
| 1:27:42| You know, that's crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5262)|
| 1:27:45| Can the public come and join you at the basketball game?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5265)|
| 1:27:47| Yeah, for $25 you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5267)|
| 1:27:50| But, you know, I just introduced this to set us to a high standard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5270)|
| 1:27:55| the same standard that the school board uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5275)|
| 1:27:57| And that's all I'm asking to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5277)|
| 1:27:58| If we want to sit here and add amendments and add, I mean, it's just a standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5278)|
| 1:28:02| If you can't follow it, then I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5282)|
| 1:28:05| But if you don't want to vote for it, don't vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5285)|
| 1:28:07| It's not personal to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5287)|
| 1:28:10| But it's a standard that the law directors advise us is a good standard and the school board uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5290)|
| 1:28:16| I just don't see a problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5296)|
| 1:28:18| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5298)|
| 1:28:20| Yeah, this is Tiki Tack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5300)|
| 1:28:22| And, you know, I've gone back over public notices for the last several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5302)|
| 1:28:31| And there are people on this board who have not met the 48-hour standard many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5311)|
| 1:28:41| But this was directed by one person at one person here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5321)|
| 1:28:49| I don't have a problem with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5329)|
| 1:28:52| Either way, I trust my ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5332)|
| 1:28:57| The people who elected me trust my ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5337)|
| 1:29:01| But if we are going to do this, then we do need to go all the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5341)|
| 1:29:07| We need to follow the law director's advice, which has always been to err on the side of caution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5347)|
| 1:29:14| If there will be more than one commissioner present, it needs to be noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5354)|
| 1:29:18| If you think there's going to be more than one present, it needs to be noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5358)|
| 1:29:22| But, you know, I have a hard time believing for the last three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5362)|
| 1:29:27| when we've had other commissioners not adhering to the 48-hour standard, and it's not been a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5367)|
| 1:29:37| And then one commissioner in particular does it, and Brian Hornback has a problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5377)|
| 1:29:46| And then it shows up at the rules committee the next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5386)|
| 1:29:50| Yeah, that makes me wonder what's really behind this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5390)|
| 1:29:52| Is this about setting good standards for ourselves or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5392)|
| 1:29:59| I have the research on the last few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5399)|
| 1:30:04| Guys, I'm disappointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5404)|
| 1:30:08| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5408)|
| 1:30:09| Yeah, I just had a question, and if the substitute resolution fails, I'll vote for the other resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5409)|
| 1:30:16| I agree with what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5416)|
| 1:30:18| I don't understand the objection to noticing these other meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5418)|
| 1:30:24| I mean, we don't know if someone's going to be there or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5424)|
| 1:30:27| and what I would hate to do is to show up at the Council of the West Nox homeowners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5427)|
| 1:30:30| Jeff's there, and say, I have to leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5430)|
| 1:30:33| because I've been to meetings on the Justice Committee, for instance, that they forgot to notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5433)|
| 1:30:38| and I was told I wasn't going to be able to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5438)|
| 1:30:42| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5442)|
| 1:30:43| I did the exact same thing on the Justice Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5443)|
| 1:30:45| And what I'm saying, though, the reason I supported Commissioner Broyles on this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5445)|
| 1:30:50| that if we put down the meetings where there frequently are going to be two, there may not be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5450)|
| 1:30:55| but frequently going to be two commissioners there where some issues that are before the commission may be discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5455)|
| 1:31:00| is that that lets the public know that we're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5460)|
| 1:31:03| And most of the time, there's not deliberations going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5463)|
| 1:31:05| but I may get up there and say, well, I'm going to vote for this or I'm not going to vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5465)|
| 1:31:09| And I think we even did that one time at the Council of the West Nox homeowners when Tony Norman was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5469)|
| 1:31:15| And we really weren't deliberating with each other, but we were talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5475)|
| 1:31:19| But the law director said that I could not go to the Justice Committee because Commissioner Andrews was going to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5479)|
| 1:31:27| And basically, I said, can I just sit in the back and listen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5487)|
| 1:31:30| And the answer was no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5490)|
| 1:31:32| And that's the reason I said, if we'll go ahead and put some of these things out there to begin with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5492)|
| 1:31:36| is I don't have to drive down to go to the Council of the West Nox homeowners, see that Jeff or Tony is already there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5496)|
| 1:31:42| and turn around and go home, or two of us have to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5502)|
| 1:31:45| Because I think it's important for us to be out there with the constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5505)|
| 1:31:48| and see what they have to say and give them the opportunity to have their input to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5508)|
| 1:31:53| and not be in a position where I have to turn around and go home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5513)|
| 1:31:56| and they don't have the opportunity to talk to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5516)|
| 1:31:58| And that's the reason I supported just putting a sort of a standing list of these meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5518)|
| 1:32:02| that frequently commissioners do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5522)|
| 1:32:04| Is there some other objection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5524)|
| 1:32:07| I mean, I might vote against it if you'll give me a good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5527)|
| 1:32:09| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5529)|
| 1:32:10| I mean, I just, you know, the West Nox homeowners, they always send out a press release.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5530)|
| 1:32:13| It's in the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5533)|
| 1:32:14| Yeah, but they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5534)|
| 1:32:15| Yeah, but it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5535)|
| 1:32:16| It doesn't matter what they send out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5536)|
| 1:32:17| Right, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5537)|
| 1:32:18| It's what they send out by our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5538)|
| 1:32:20| Every meeting that we attend is found on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5540)|
| 1:32:22| And if you want to send out that you're going to a Republican club or a Democratic club or an HOA, send it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5542)|
| 1:32:30| I'm just, I just think we should have a standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5550)|
| 1:32:33| And, you know, it's, if there's, you know, been violations, I mean, I remember the safety committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5553)|
| 1:32:38| or justice committee violation where I was there first or, you know, we didn't get noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5558)|
| 1:32:44| And so, I mean, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5564)|
| 1:32:47| But, you know, that's a committee that should have been done through the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5567)|
| 1:32:52| Yeah, it should have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5572)|
| 1:32:53| I mean, but, see, it doesn't count if just because whoever the homeowner president sends a notice to the paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5573)|
| 1:32:59| that they're meeting, it has to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5579)|
| 1:33:01| And I agree with everything you're saying on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5581)|
| 1:33:03| I think we can notice those things so the public knows there may be people there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5583)|
| 1:33:07| But, you know, I think we need to have a, you know, a standard, a single standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5587)|
| 1:33:13| And I'm, you know, I'm fine with the 48 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5593)|
| 1:33:16| But if we just have this standing, whatever the commissioners want to put as monthly notices that these meetings are occurring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5596)|
| 1:33:27| I think that would cover us and it would give us the transparency that I think we all want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5607)|
| 1:33:31| And that's the reason I supported Amy in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5611)|
| 1:33:34| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5614)|
| 1:33:35| A little bit more clarification from the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5615)|
| 1:33:38| Joe, let's say this crowd out here, we're out in the halls community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5618)|
| 1:33:44| We're holding a public or we're holding a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5624)|
| 1:33:48| And any meeting I go to, and I think Amy mentioned it, the press is, I can't think of a meeting I don't go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5628)|
| 1:33:53| The press is not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5633)|
| 1:33:55| Then Dave Wright shows up and we're just talking about whatever the issue is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5635)|
| 1:34:03| The press is already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5643)|
| 1:34:05| Can we continue doing it or does one of us have to leave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5645)|
| 1:34:08| Sir, regardless of the fact the press is there, if it wasn't duly noticed in advance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5648)|
| 1:34:15| then it doesn't put the public on notice and that would probably fall short of the requirements under the Open Records Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5655)|
| 1:34:22| If you start to discuss and deliberate, you're putting yourselves in harm's way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5662)|
| 1:34:26| Let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5666)|
| 1:34:27| What if I said I'd show of hands who's in favor of this and who's not on whatever the issue is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5667)|
| 1:34:32| Is there a problem with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5672)|
| 1:34:34| Now you're communicating directly with the crowd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5674)|
| 1:34:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5676)|
| 1:34:37| Yeah, I think that would be acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5677)|
| 1:34:39| Again, you don't want to get into a situation where two of you are there and you're going to ultimately either discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5679)|
| 1:34:46| People throw the terms around deliberate and discussion, but courts aren't as forgiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5686)|
| 1:34:50| You know, the bottom line is if you're talking about something that you ultimately may be called upon to vote on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5690)|
| 1:34:56| you're putting yourself in harm's way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5696)|
| 1:34:58| I'll go up to the hall of senior citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5698)|
| 1:35:00| There will be 120 people, and I'll ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5700)|
| 1:35:02| You know, I represent the people, and I want to know what the people think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5702)|
| 1:35:07| It's not about Larry Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5707)|
| 1:35:08| It's what the people in our district, what they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5708)|
| 1:35:11| And, yes, I will ask for a show of hands in a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5711)|
| 1:35:14| And that's fine, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5714)|
| 1:35:15| The problem is where you get in danger is that then you turn to your colleague and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5715)|
| 1:35:18| what did you think of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5718)|
| 1:35:20| And, you know, that's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5720)|
| 1:35:22| Directly communicating with people is another story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5722)|
| 1:35:26| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5726)|
| 1:35:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5727)|
| 1:35:30| I agree with Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5730)|
| 1:35:32| We're beating this thing up pretty unnecessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5732)|
| 1:35:38| The lady that's being reappointed to the Ethics Committee just said, hey, we're bored stiff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5738)|
| 1:35:43| We don't have anything to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5743)|
| 1:35:46| So, obviously, we're doing a much better job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5746)|
| 1:35:50| There's nobody on this body that deliberates outside this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5750)|
| 1:35:55| I've never even heard a whisper of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5755)|
| 1:35:58| I don't think it will ever happen to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5758)|
| 1:36:01| Maybe we'll get farther along, and sometimes that starts to creep back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5761)|
| 1:36:07| But I just don't see it as a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5767)|
| 1:36:13| This sub-motion will be kind of a compromised thing there to accommodate meetings where we might run into each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5773)|
| 1:36:23| So I'll support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5783)|
| 1:36:24| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5784)|
| 1:36:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5786)|
| 1:36:29| I guess we need to pause for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5789)|
| 1:36:32| I hate to do this, but the resolution that's before us starts with Section F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5792)|
| 1:36:47| This is what's being inserted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5807)|
| 1:36:49| Commissioned called meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5809)|
| 1:36:54| Any county commissioner desirous of meeting with fellow commissioners at a time and place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5814)|
| 1:37:00| other than regularly scheduled notice public meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5820)|
| 1:37:04| shall ensure such meeting is publicly noticed through the commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5824)|
| 1:37:10| And it goes further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5830)|
| 1:37:13| This has nothing to do with Commissioner McKenzie and I going to Town Hall East,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5833)|
| 1:37:20| has nothing to do with me being in a veterans parade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5840)|
| 1:37:26| has nothing to do with the groundbreaking at Carter Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5846)|
| 1:37:31| It has nothing to do with chance meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5851)|
| 1:37:36| The only reason that this is before us is that if one commissioner is desirous of talking to another commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5856)|
| 1:37:45| one-on-one and discussing something, it needs to be publicly noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5865)|
| 1:37:51| That's the only thing that's included in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5871)|
| 1:37:54| And if one commissioner wants to talk to another commissioner, they have to publicly notice it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5874)|
| 1:38:00| We already abide by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5880)|
| 1:38:02| It's just putting 48 hours on it in writing, I think, in print.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5882)|
| 1:38:07| We may already realize that we need to do 48 hours, else why would we be fussing about 44 hours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5887)|
| 1:38:15| So maybe you need to read the paragraph that's in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5895)|
| 1:38:19| Commissioners that want to talk to another commissioner about a certain subject has to have an agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5899)|
| 1:38:25| has to commit it to notes, and you have to get some kind of proper notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5905)|
| 1:38:33| And that's what's before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5913)|
| 1:38:34| We're not talking about all those other things that we've talked about for 45 minutes that are chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5914)|
| 1:38:42| Again, I do not support the amended, excuse me, the substitute motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5922)|
| 1:38:49| and I will be in favor of what's before us when it returns to the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5929)|
| 1:38:56| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5936)|
| 1:38:57| I just really agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5937)|
| 1:38:59| We've talked way too much on this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5939)|
| 1:39:01| But that's what I read right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5941)|
| 1:39:03| It says other than regularly scheduled notice public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5943)|
| 1:39:07| And these meetings are, you know, they're not noticed unless we notice them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5947)|
| 1:39:14| Please, Dr. Briggs, go to the section F that's on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5954)|
| 1:39:21| It's the resolution itself, and it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5961)|
| 1:39:24| any county commissioner desires a meeting with fellow commissioners at a time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5964)|
| 1:39:28| and place other than regularly scheduled notice public meetings shall ensure such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5968)|
| 1:39:32| A public meeting is publicly noticed through, and I may have missed a word there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5972)|
| 1:39:36| through the commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5976)|
| 1:39:38| It has nothing to do with chance meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5978)|
| 1:39:41| It's when one commissioner wants to talk to another commissioner about Carter Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5981)|
| 1:39:46| that's when it needs to be publicly noticed, have an agenda, and keep notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5986)|
| 1:39:52| I'll put a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5992)|
| 1:39:54| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5994)|
| 1:39:56| I think what you read says the opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=5996)|
| 1:40:00| I think what Dr. Briggs is saying is other than regularly scheduled public meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6000)|
| 1:40:07| if a commissioner wants to speak to another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6007)|
| 1:40:10| In order for us to get into the bin of regularly scheduled public meetings, we have to notice them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6010)|
| 1:40:18| They're not regularly scheduled public meetings until Jolie sends out an e-mail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6018)|
| 1:40:23| and says these are our regularly scheduled public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6023)|
| 1:40:27| We have to set that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6027)|
| 1:40:30| Just because everyone knows when the House Republicans are meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6030)|
| 1:40:34| or everyone knows when the Boyd-Clout Democrats are meeting, who really go to those meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6034)|
| 1:40:39| it doesn't put us in that bin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6039)|
| 1:40:44| So in order for us to get past the first part of what you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6044)|
| 1:40:48| we have to have defined them as regularly scheduled public notices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6048)|
| 1:40:56| If a commissioner speaks to another commissioner outside of that regularly scheduled public notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6056)|
| 1:41:03| then they have to sunshine it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6063)|
| 1:41:06| If they speak to them at a regularly scheduled public notice, then they're exempt from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6066)|
| 1:41:12| So in order for us to build that wall of any meeting being a regularly scheduled publicly noticed meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6072)|
| 1:41:22| we have to define that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6082)|
| 1:41:24| We have to send a list out of what those meetings are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6084)|
| 1:41:27| And as it stands today, we don't have those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6087)|
| 1:41:29| So that's all this amendment is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6089)|
| 1:41:32| It's saying let's build that wall up of what we consider regularly scheduled public meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6092)|
| 1:41:38| and then we'll move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6098)|
| 1:41:40| You want to meet at Time Warp or you want to meet at Panera?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6100)|
| 1:41:43| Now you've got to be within that 48-hour window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6103)|
| 1:41:46| That's how I read that resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6106)|
| 1:41:48| I think I'll ask the law director to comment on that, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6108)|
| 1:41:52| Just so we're clear, again, I apologize to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6112)|
| 1:42:00| I've called him speechless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6120)|
| 1:42:01| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6121)|
| 1:42:02| Hey, I'm going to write this date down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6122)|
| 1:42:04| Mr. Law Director, if I might, before you speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6124)|
| 1:42:09| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6129)|
| 1:42:10| I think I have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6130)|
| 1:42:12| And I've asked him a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6132)|
| 1:42:15| And I'm asking him for the floor from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6135)|
| 1:42:20| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6140)|
| 1:42:21| I prefer to refer to my clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6141)|
| 1:42:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6143)|
| 1:42:24| So who are your clients on that one, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6144)|
| 1:42:27| I've asked a question of the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6147)|
| 1:42:29| I would like to get an answer without.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6149)|
| 1:42:31| I just asked a pretty, what I think is a pretty simple question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6151)|
| 1:42:34| Mr. Law Director, if you'd give us your opinion, and I'm going to recognize Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6154)|
| 1:42:38| I want to make sure I understand your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6158)|
| 1:42:41| I'm asking, okay, as the resolution reads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6161)|
| 1:42:46| it says other than regularly scheduled notice public meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6166)|
| 1:42:52| if we're going to speak to each other, we have to give 48 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6172)|
| 1:42:55| That's what the resolution says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6175)|
| 1:42:57| Yeah, when you conflate it, that's the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6177)|
| 1:42:59| One, if you're going to meet outside of a duly noticed public meeting, set a public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6179)|
| 1:43:04| And secondly, don't do so under 48 hours unless you're dealing with an emergency situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6184)|
| 1:43:12| or a matter of great public importance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6192)|
| 1:43:14| So my question to you is, like you just said, if we're going to meet outside of a regular meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6194)|
| 1:43:21| then we need to do these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6201)|
| 1:43:23| My question is, what constitutes, and I think you answered it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6203)|
| 1:43:27| what constitutes a regularly scheduled notice public meeting for the county commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6207)|
| 1:43:32| Well, for instance, this is a duly noticed public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6212)|
| 1:43:36| It's advertised in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6216)|
| 1:43:37| The media is put on notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6217)|
| 1:43:39| The general public is put on notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6219)|
| 1:43:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6221)|
| 1:43:42| So because it comes from this body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6222)|
| 1:43:44| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6224)|
| 1:43:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6225)|
| 1:43:46| So my statement is, in order for us to build that bend of this queue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6226)|
| 1:43:51| what we consider regularly scheduled public notice, doesn't that have to come from this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6231)|
| 1:43:58| someone appointed by this body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6238)|
| 1:44:04| So, in other words, if you want to hold a ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6244)|
| 1:44:07| How do we define regularly scheduled public notice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6247)|
| 1:44:11| We have to send something out to say it's ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6251)|
| 1:44:14| Yeah, I mean, if you look at its common usage, you meet monthly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6254)|
| 1:44:18| You meet monthly for your commission workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6258)|
| 1:44:20| You meet monthly for your beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6260)|
| 1:44:22| Those are considered regularly scheduled public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6262)|
| 1:44:25| I think what this is designed for is meetings other than those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6265)|
| 1:44:30| like two or more commissioners meeting for breakfast to discuss county business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6270)|
| 1:44:35| That would not be considered a regularly scheduled public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6275)|
| 1:44:38| It would just be a public meeting that has to be noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6278)|
| 1:44:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6282)|
| 1:44:43| So any public meeting has to be noticed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6283)|
| 1:44:46| Correct, if two or more are going to gather to deliberate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6286)|
| 1:44:49| Right now, Julie will consistently send out on a monthly basis your regularly scheduled meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6289)|
| 1:44:54| There's no mystery to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6294)|
| 1:44:56| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6296)|
| 1:44:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6297)|
| 1:44:58| That's exactly the point that's being made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6298)|
| 1:45:02| Regularly scheduled meetings were just delineated by the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6302)|
| 1:45:10| Other meetings where a county commissioner desires a meeting of fellow commissioners is what we have before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6310)|
| 1:45:25| That's the reason you put out the public notice of a commissioner desiring to speak to another commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6325)|
| 1:45:33| and I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6333)|
| 1:45:37| The thing that is not covered in Section F that will be in the code will not be, as I had listed a moment ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6337)|
| 1:45:50| at Carter Elementary School Veterans Day Parade or Town Hall East meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6350)|
| 1:45:55| Because at those three occurrences, one commissioner is not desiring to meet with another commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6355)|
| 1:46:02| So they would not fall into the category of requiring a sunshine statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6362)|
| 1:46:10| I want to make a statement, and then I'd like to recognize Commissioner Orme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6370)|
| 1:46:14| Then we need to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6374)|
| 1:46:15| I mean, we've still got things to go unless someone really needs to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6375)|
| 1:46:20| It wasn't that long ago that this commission, commissioners, were the punching bag of the media,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6380)|
| 1:46:28| the punching bag of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6388)|
| 1:46:30| We were the poster children for how not to conduct ourselves in terms of properly noticing meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6390)|
| 1:46:38| That has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6398)|
| 1:46:40| We have done a very good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6400)|
| 1:46:42| People now have told me that we are now an example of what to do and how to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6402)|
| 1:46:48| as opposed to the example of how not to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6408)|
| 1:46:51| I can recall going to a meeting where former Commissioner Luthold and I were at a meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6411)|
| 1:46:55| and it was not properly noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6415)|
| 1:46:56| Out of an abundance of caution, we didn't leave, but he sat on one side of the room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6416)|
| 1:47:00| I sat on the other side of the room, and we said hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6420)|
| 1:47:03| That was it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6423)|
| 1:47:04| We didn't deliberate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6424)|
| 1:47:05| We didn't do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6425)|
| 1:47:06| Out of an abundance of caution, but that was the right thing to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6426)|
| 1:47:08| because we didn't want to give the appearance that we were trying to deliberate on anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6428)|
| 1:47:12| But we're in a situation now, Chancellor Fanchler has made it very clear in his ruling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6432)|
| 1:47:18| that you can discuss the weather, you can discuss sports, you can discuss anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6438)|
| 1:47:24| but you cannot discuss or deliberate any item that is on the upcoming agenda unless it is properly noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6444)|
| 1:47:35| I'm in favor of all of this because I think out of an abundance of caution, let's just go ahead and do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6455)|
| 1:47:40| It takes 60 seconds to call Jolie and say, Jolie, I'm going to be at the so-and-so meeting, send out a notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6460)|
| 1:47:47| And she does it every single time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6467)|
| 1:47:49| That protects us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6469)|
| 1:47:51| We do it within 48 hours or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6471)|
| 1:47:54| Again, that's a protection for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6474)|
| 1:47:56| I would like for us to continue to be the example of how to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6476)|
| 1:48:01| and not the example of how not to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6481)|
| 1:48:03| because for a long time this commission was the punching bag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6483)|
| 1:48:07| So, Commissioner Wendy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6487)|
| 1:48:10| I wasn't going to make a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6490)|
| 1:48:12| I was just going to say we beat this dead horse to death and it was time to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6492)|
| 1:48:16| But I am going to say one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6496)|
| 1:48:18| I think publicly noticing a meeting that I attend every month, that I don't know who's going to be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6498)|
| 1:48:26| and law director opined last week that if we publicly notice a meeting, we have to take notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6506)|
| 1:48:34| We have to list everybody that's at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6514)|
| 1:48:37| And not that I'm afraid to take notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6517)|
| 1:48:39| It's just our Republican meetings are a lot of times boring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6519)|
| 1:48:44| And you all may not want to see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6524)|
| 1:48:47| So, no, these are pretty exciting because we can really beat something to death around here, I'm telling you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6527)|
| 1:48:53| Just so I can be clear, Commissioner, what I was saying is you don't have to have an agenda and take notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6533)|
| 1:48:59| If you notice the halls of a Republican meeting, and you show up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6539)|
| 1:49:03| and another commissioner shows up, and you don't deliberate into South County business, you're not under that requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6543)|
| 1:49:09| If you notice that meeting and a commissioner comes up and said, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6549)|
| 1:49:12| while Jeff and I are here, we'll be voting tomorrow, then you're going to have to follow the compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6552)|
| 1:49:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6560)|
| 1:49:21| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6561)|
| 1:49:22| Basically, we're going to have to publicly notice every meeting that we go to on a chance that somebody else is going to show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6562)|
| 1:49:28| And I don't support this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6568)|
| 1:49:30| I think that we're going down a slippery slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6570)|
| 1:49:32| And we could add and add and add and add to this until people are blue in the face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6572)|
| 1:49:37| So I'm calling for the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6577)|
| 1:49:40| Commissioner Burroughs, if you can make a quick statement, we'll vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6580)|
| 1:49:42| One statement and then I'm done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6582)|
| 1:49:45| I know, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6585)|
| 1:49:46| I just want to give her the opportunity to speak one last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6586)|
| 1:49:48| I just wanted to say thank you, Commissioner Hammond, for your leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6588)|
| 1:49:53| and the statement that you just made about how important this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6593)|
| 1:49:57| and that we should hold ourselves to this kind of standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6597)|
| 1:50:00| When we were talking about meetings, these are, and I think that what Dr. Briggs said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6600)|
| 1:50:09| alleviates maybe, I hope, some of Jeff's anxiety over this, that we don't have to do this month after month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6609)|
| 1:50:17| All we have to do is give Jolie a list and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6617)|
| 1:50:20| this group meets every month at this time at this place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6620)|
| 1:50:23| Please put it on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6623)|
| 1:50:25| And that covers us as a public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6625)|
| 1:50:27| So this is not adding to anybody's workload.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6627)|
| 1:50:33| You know, as I said, there have been very many public notices sent out in the past year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6633)|
| 1:50:45| that did not meet the 48-hour mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6645)|
| 1:50:48| You've already mentioned that, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6648)|
| 1:50:50| It's time to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6650)|
| 1:50:51| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6651)|
| 1:50:54| I'm sorry, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6654)|
| 1:50:55| I have the floor right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6655)|
| 1:50:57| I know, but you're not supposed to go over the same thing over and over and over again either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6657)|
| 1:51:00| Commissioners, commissioners, let's come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6660)|
| 1:51:02| Amy, if you would make your statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6662)|
| 1:51:04| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6664)|
| 1:51:05| I just, well, since, I guess, my feeling, like I said, since Commissioner Owenby| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6665)|
| 1:51:12| and some of the other commissioners have sent out more than one notice this year with less than 48 hours notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6672)|
| 1:51:18| but it was not until I sent out one that it got Brian Hornbach's knickers twisted up, that it became an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6678)|
| 1:51:27| I feel like I do have the right to speak on this a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6687)|
| 1:51:31| and I do appreciate you, Chairman Hammond, showing some leadership on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6691)|
| 1:51:36| and leading us in the direction we need to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6696)|
| 1:51:40| Roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6700)|
| 1:51:41| The motion on the floor is a substitute motion for a 48-hour notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6701)|
| 1:51:44| but also all regularly noticed meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6704)|
| 1:51:47| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6707)|
| 1:51:49| For the amendment, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6709)|
| 1:51:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6710)|
| 1:51:51| Yes, this is for the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6711)|
| 1:51:52| Or this is for the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6712)|
| 1:51:53| Add that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6713)|
| 1:51:54| Approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6714)|
| 1:51:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6716)|

| 1:52:43| What else do we have before we get to Hillside?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6763)|
| 1:52:47| We've got to vote on the rule now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6767)|
| 1:52:49| Or is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6769)|
| 1:52:50| That incorporated the rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6770)|
| 1:52:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6772)|

| 1:54:05| Is there anything else you'd like to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6845)|
| 1:54:08| I guess I would like for some of the school representatives to come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6848)|
| 1:54:12| We might ask them a question or two about this, see what they think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6852)|
| 1:54:20| McIntyre is not here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6860)|
| 1:54:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6861)|
| 1:54:23| No folks in here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6863)|
| 1:54:24| I don't see any of the school representatives here, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6864)|
| 1:54:26| No school people here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6866)|
| 1:54:28| Well, then we can talk about them in their absence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6868)|
| 1:54:33| Nobody is here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6873)|
| 1:54:34| No, I don't see anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6874)|
| 1:54:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6876)|
| 1:54:38| I would like to mention a few of us were not at the luncheon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6878)|
| 1:54:44| So the discussion item was around the notion that I suppose that we need to improve relations between the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6884)|
| 1:54:55| Of course, there's a big budget shortfall that we anticipate in the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6895)|
| 1:55:01| My discussion with the group at the luncheon sort of revolved around the notion that what I consider huge issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6901)|
| 1:55:14| that are beyond the scope of a retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6914)|
| 1:55:18| We've had meetings with the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6918)|
| 1:55:23| We've had summits under Ragsdale of over 1,000 people being in attendance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6923)|
| 1:55:31| And what we have is not much movement in the way of improvement of the public schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6931)|
| 1:55:40| The public schools are near and dear to my heart, of course, because I worked in them for 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6940)|
| 1:55:49| And I experience some of the pain right now that teachers and administrators at the building level are going through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6949)|
| 1:55:56| with this just bizarre evaluation system, which has been imposed on teachers effectively by the state government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6956)|
| 1:56:06| So my discussion was about that, that this needs to be a –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6966)|
| 1:56:13| I consider Knox County as – and somewhat because of our governor being from our county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6973)|
| 1:56:22| and sort of the current superintendent being – I don't know how to say this without being offensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6982)|
| 1:56:34| I won't say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6994)|
| 1:56:35| Anyway, there's a combination of events that are going on right now that make us possibly very effective on the state level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=6995)|
| 1:56:47| in terms of what we might influence in the State Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7007)|
| 1:56:53| So that being said, I think that we should have a very broad and expansive view of our role in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7013)|
| 1:57:04| and its influence on education and be warned that there are some things that are happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7024)|
| 1:57:10| that are here right in Knox County that are not going well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7030)|
| 1:57:14| And this evaluation system is very, very hurtful to the system, to teachers, and to administrators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7034)|
| 1:57:26| So that's kind of some things that we talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7046)|
| 1:57:32| and the chair was agreeable to make contact with some state-level folks that are committee-level folks, representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7052)|
| 1:57:44| And so I hope that discussion will proceed in a broad way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7064)|
| 1:57:49| Just for the public's consumption, we're scheduled to meet January 26th and 27th in a retreat with the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7069)|
| 1:57:55| This will be the first time that we've done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7075)|
| 1:57:57| We have had dinners, but never to this extent and to this level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7077)|
| 1:58:00| One of the things we talked about in our luncheon today was some of the issues that we want to bring up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7080)|
| 1:58:04| Obviously, funding is one and a major issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7084)|
| 1:58:06| But also vacant properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7086)|
| 1:58:08| How do we deal with vacant properties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7088)|
| 1:58:10| And also the idea of the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7090)|
| 1:58:12| How do we discuss some of the things about the teacher evaluations, some of the BEP plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7092)|
| 1:58:17| And we talked about perhaps inviting Representative Montgomery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7097)|
| 1:58:20| who is head of the House Education Committee from Sevier County, to come and be with us for a period of time during that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7100)|
| 1:58:25| But Mr. Deakins and I are going to be meeting in the next couple of days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7105)|
| 1:58:29| We'll be sending you out a proposed agenda, and we'll be going from there on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7109)|
| 1:58:33| Could you clarify about those days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7113)|
| 1:58:34| Pensions also, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7114)|
| 1:58:35| I'm sorry, Commissioner Shouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7115)|
| 1:58:36| I said pensions also, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7116)|
| 1:58:37| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7117)|
| 1:58:38| We'll be talking about the pension plan as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7118)|
| 1:58:39| It's January 26th and 27th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7119)|
| 1:58:41| That's a Thursday, Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7121)|
| 1:58:42| No, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7122)|
| 1:58:43| It's Friday, Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7123)|
| 1:58:44| It will be 27th and 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7124)|
| 1:58:45| 27th and 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7125)|
| 1:58:46| Yes, we'll do it on Friday evening and then Saturday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7126)|
| 1:58:48| for everybody to get back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7128)|
| 1:58:49| Commissioner Brooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7129)|
| 1:58:50| Yes, and where is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7130)|
| 1:58:53| We're looking at R.T. Lodge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7133)|
| 1:58:55| That's Ruby Tuesday Lodge in Maryville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7135)|
| 1:58:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7137)|
| 1:58:58| Is there any way that we could do it in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7138)|
| 1:59:01| We could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7141)|
| 1:59:02| Those facilities are available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7142)|
| 1:59:04| We need to find out from you how many people want to spend the night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7144)|
| 1:59:07| and how many people just want to go and have dinner and come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7147)|
| 1:59:10| Well, I'd just like to keep it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7150)|
| 1:59:11| If we're going to be spending money on this, I'd like to keep it in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7151)|
| 1:59:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7154)|
| 1:59:15| We'll look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7155)|
| 1:59:17| We just need to find a place that can accommodate us and do what we're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7157)|
| 1:59:20| I want to say, point of clarification, this isn't coming out, no county tax funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7160)|
| 1:59:25| No tax funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7165)|
| 1:59:26| This is all being financed by the Cornerstone Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7166)|
| 1:59:29| They were the ones who recommended that because they've had some success there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7169)|
| 1:59:32| so I'll be happy to talk with them about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7172)|
| 1:59:35| I'd still like to keep any money that we spend local,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7175)|
| 1:59:38| and so I would just like to make that as a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7178)|
| 1:59:43| How many people can stay at your house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7183)|
| 1:59:45| My house, several if you want to sleep on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7185)|
| 1:59:49| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7189)|
| 1:59:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7191)|
| 1:59:52| I was wondering what the slope category that Lodge was at before we go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7192)|
| 2:00:00| No, but I would, as soon as we get to the hillside thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7200)|
| 2:00:06| I hope that we can take a break before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7206)|
| 2:00:08| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7208)|
| 2:00:09| We will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7209)|
| 2:00:10| We have one other discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7210)|
| 2:00:11| Commissioner Wright, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7211)|
| 2:00:16| Discussion of Knox County codes regarding violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7216)|
| 2:00:21| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7221)|
| 2:00:23| During this past week, I received a group of signatures under this following heading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7223)|
| 2:00:33| The persons whose signatures appear below believe the Department of Code Enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7233)|
| 2:00:38| should make public the identity of persons making complaints to the Code Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7238)|
| 2:00:45| We, the undersigned, are not disturbed by Mr. Doyle McElhaney's continuing to show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7245)|
| 2:00:51| and sell household goods from his garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7251)|
| 2:00:54| There's no unsightly appearance to the property caused by this action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7254)|
| 2:01:01| Since there are 74 signatures to this, I've brought it here for us to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7261)|
| 2:01:10| I do not think that Mr. Doyle McElhaney is disagreeing with the yard sale regulation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7270)|
| 2:01:20| or code, which is three per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7280)|
| 2:01:24| I think what he's asking is that whenever the Knox County Code Enforcement person showed up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7284)|
| 2:01:34| and because we do not have code police, in other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7294)|
| 2:01:37| the only way anyone gets investigated on code violation is through someone making a complaint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7297)|
| 2:01:45| I believe that what's being asked for is that since the violation of code complaint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7305)|
| 2:01:53| is a public record, he would like to have it so he would know who made the complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7313)|
| 2:01:59| Now, Mr. Dwight VanDeVate and I have talked about it earlier today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7319)|
| 2:02:05| and I believe we're somewhat in agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7325)|
| 2:02:07| but let us hear from the administration about how they look at code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7327)|
| 2:02:13| and what is the current policy, and then we need to discuss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7333)|
| 2:02:18| we commissioners need to discuss if we think something needs to be done differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7338)|
| 2:02:22| I do have a point of order, and I'm just asking because we had an opinion from our law director last time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7342)|
| 2:02:28| that on discussion items that no one would be allowed to speak except for commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7348)|
| 2:02:34| I'm just, you know, as a matter of fact, I think you brought that up before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7354)|
| 2:02:39| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7359)|
| 2:02:42| If that be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7362)|
| 2:02:44| Well, you were the one that brought it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7364)|
| 2:02:48| And what was the subject about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7368)|
| 2:02:50| The subject dealt with Carter School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7370)|
| 2:02:53| When we asked the school superintendent and the chairman of the board to speak, they were not allowed to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7373)|
| 2:02:58| And I'm glad you brought that up because there was nothing on the agenda that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7378)|
| 2:03:01| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7381)|
| 2:03:02| There's nothing on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7382)|
| 2:03:03| It was on the agenda as a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7383)|
| 2:03:08| I disagree with you because it was not on the agenda as a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7388)|
| 2:03:12| It was on the agenda to approve the contract with the developer who had withdrawn from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7392)|
| 2:03:19| If that were on the agenda, they could have been allowed to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7399)|
| 2:03:22| But this was brought up after the person that got the contract withdrew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7402)|
| 2:03:29| And if I recall, it was Tony Norman who put it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7409)|
| 2:03:32| It was his discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7412)|
| 2:03:34| He said we're trying to see what had happened, you know, with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7414)|
| 2:03:39| And he said I'd like to have the chairman of the board and the superintendent of schools speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7419)|
| 2:03:46| And the ruling was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7426)|
| 2:03:47| We had nothing on the agenda, so it could not be discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7427)|
| 2:03:51| No, it was on the agenda as a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7431)|
| 2:03:53| But the ruling was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7433)|
| 2:03:54| The ruling was is that discussion items are between commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7434)|
| 2:03:58| and outside people are not allowed to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7438)|
| 2:04:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7440)|
| 2:04:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7441)|
| 2:04:02| And I'll live with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7442)|
| 2:04:03| Because what we have before us right now for discussion among the commissioners is a petition by 74 signators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7443)|
| 2:04:11| speaking to the fact that not to the fact that the person had more than three yard sales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7451)|
| 2:04:18| but to whether or not the public record of the complaint containing the name of the complainant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7458)|
| 2:04:30| will be released by the code enforcement officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7470)|
| 2:04:35| That's what the individual constituent in the 8th District is asking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7475)|
| 2:04:40| Now, what I have brought is for discussion, and since it is not properly on the agenda for this month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7480)|
| 2:04:56| I am almost faced with the same dilemma that occurred last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7496)|
| 2:05:02| Well, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7502)|
| 2:05:05| Commissioner Wright, it's a legal issue, bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7505)|
| 2:05:08| I don't care what their policy is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7508)|
| 2:05:10| Bottom line is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7510)|
| 2:05:11| If they're getting complaints and it doesn't fall under the narrow exceptions of the Tennessee Open Records Law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7511)|
| 2:05:15| it's public record, they have to release it to the constituent if that constituent is, in fact, a Tennessee resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7515)|
| 2:05:21| Bottom line, there are some rare exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7521)|
| 2:05:23| Confidentiality, that's not one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7523)|
| 2:05:25| If the people complaining are, in fact, calling the audit hotline, that does give them confidentiality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7525)|
| 2:05:31| But if there are standard complaints right now on the record, they're subject to public scrutiny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7531)|
| 2:05:38| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7538)|
| 2:05:41| So if that constituent wants copies, they get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7541)|
| 2:05:46| One of the things I think that we would have heard is that it's not necessary in order to file a code complaint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7546)|
| 2:05:53| that you give your name and address and contact information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7553)|
| 2:05:58| You can call and say from the pay phone at the so-and-so is doing so-and-so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7558)|
| 2:06:11| and the county takes that as a complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7571)|
| 2:06:15| The administration takes that as a complaint and deals with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7575)|
| 2:06:18| There is no contact information in that particular instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7578)|
| 2:06:22| So in order to comply with a request for release, the discussion may be, should we have that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7582)|
| 2:06:33| It's a blank space on the form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7593)|
| 2:06:35| When you call and report, you have to give the address of where you're complaining, and it asks who is making the complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7595)|
| 2:06:43| So if that's blank, do we then have a valid report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7603)|
| 2:06:48| Well, they can certainly the law supports anonymous tips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7608)|
| 2:06:53| It does with law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7613)|
| 2:06:54| It does with the audit hotline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7614)|
| 2:06:57| The argument could be made that they can certainly act on an anonymous tip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7617)|
| 2:07:07| The question that I have before me is, how do we think commission ought to deal with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7627)|
| 2:07:15| A person with 74 signatures is asking that the person making the complaint be revealed to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7635)|
| 2:07:21| Do we need to ask the administration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7641)|
| 2:07:23| Do we need to codify what kind of response needs to be made to this individual making a request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7643)|
| 2:07:32| Pardon me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7652)|
| 2:07:33| As I understand it, the law director has said that that information must be revealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7653)|
| 2:07:36| It's public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7656)|
| 2:07:37| So I would suggest that you write a letter to Mr. VandeVate quoting the law director and asking that that be released within 72 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7657)|
| 2:07:44| Really, it should come from the citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7664)|
| 2:07:46| They should just send it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7666)|
| 2:07:47| The citizen can file for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7667)|
| 2:07:48| They make a public records request, they get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7668)|
| 2:07:51| But in terms of you actually dictating that policy, that really falls under the administrative part of government, under the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7671)|
| 2:07:59| You can suggest their process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7679)|
| 2:08:02| But I have given open records training to county staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7682)|
| 2:08:06| and I inform them that what is a public record, what is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7686)|
| 2:08:10| And if they get a request, they honor it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7690)|
| 2:08:12| For me personally, I think my response to someone asking for a public records release from me sitting as a county commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7692)|
| 2:08:22| I would refer them to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7702)|
| 2:08:24| Is that an acceptable policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7704)|
| 2:08:27| Because I cannot technically make a legal determination about what is publicly to be released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7707)|
| 2:08:35| Well, that's fine, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7715)|
| 2:08:36| I mean, citizens contact me all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7716)|
| 2:08:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7718)|
| 2:08:39| But then where I was headed, you were defining the relationship of code administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7719)|
| 2:08:44| They have public record release information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7724)|
| 2:08:49| They're trained in it, and they can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7729)|
| 2:08:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7731)|
| 2:08:52| If they're the records custodian, they're the ones who should release the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7732)|
| 2:08:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7736)|
| 2:08:57| You know, this gets to another issue also about people, like you mentioned, making tips to the police or to other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7737)|
| 2:09:07| I mean, is it you can't make a complaint without you can?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7747)|
| 2:09:16| I mean, if the record's there with someone's name on it, I guess you'd have to release it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7756)|
| 2:09:20| But, you know, if you don't have to, I mean, if you want to remain anonymous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7760)|
| 2:09:24| because you can certainly see how some revenge could be taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7764)|
| 2:09:27| I mean, but if you can do it, then that's, I guess that answers that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7767)|
| 2:09:33| Yeah, I think that was kind of the impetus behind the state coming up with the audit hotline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7773)|
| 2:09:37| That seemed to be in the legislative history I read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7777)|
| 2:09:40| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7780)|
| 2:09:42| I just need a quick clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7782)|
| 2:09:44| I want to make sure that I've got this right, Dave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7784)|
| 2:09:48| So if someone calls in, and this is different, I understand city and county may be different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7788)|
| 2:09:55| which is why I'm asking for clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7795)|
| 2:09:57| Someone can call in a complaint to county codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7797)|
| 2:10:01| They can either give their information, name and address, or not give their information, name or address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7801)|
| 2:10:09| Mr. Law Director, either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7809)|
| 2:10:12| But if the person that they make the complaint on wants to make a public records request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7812)|
| 2:10:20| that information has to be released to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7820)|
| 2:10:22| but they need to understand that the information they get might be that it was an anonymous complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7822)|
| 2:10:28| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7828)|
| 2:10:29| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7829)|
| 2:10:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7830)|
| 2:10:32| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7832)|
| 2:10:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7834)|
| 2:10:35| We are going to take a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7835)|
| 2:10:36| We'll come back at 4.05 if that's acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7836)|
| 2:10:38| That gives us 15 minutes, and we will have Hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7838)|
| 2:10:40| That will be the last item on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7840)|
| 2:10:42| We're going back into session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7842)|
| 2:10:44| If you'll take your seats, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7844)|
| 2:11:05| I'd like to go back into session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7865)|
| 2:11:06| We have one item left on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7866)|
| 2:11:08| Clerk, if you'd read into the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7868)|
| 2:11:10| On page seven, consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7870)|
| 2:11:15| initiating the Hillside and Ridgetop Protection Plan dated November 2011 as an amendment to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7875)|
| 2:11:20| Knox County General Plan 2033 by transmitting the plan to the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7880)|
| 2:11:26| for its review and consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7886)|
| 2:11:28| This is Resolution 902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7888)|
| 2:11:31| If I might, ladies and gentlemen, before we have the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7891)|
| 2:11:34| is to explain to the audience in our luncheon today, we talked about how to handle our public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7894)|
| 2:11:40| and this is what we have agreed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7900)|
| 2:11:43| Those of you who have signed up will have an opportunity to address the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7903)|
| 2:11:46| You will have five minutes, and at the end of the five minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7906)|
| 2:11:50| we will ask you to allow the next person to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7910)|
| 2:11:53| So you will have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7913)|
| 2:11:55| We will not have rebuttals, and we will not spend time going back and forth, back and forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7915)|
| 2:11:59| but each of you will have an opportunity to address us for your full five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7919)|
| 2:12:03| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7923)|
| 2:12:05| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7925)|
| 2:12:07| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7927)|
| 2:12:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7928)|
| 2:12:09| Motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7929)|
| 2:12:10| Could I add one thing to that, that they don't all talk about the same thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7930)|
| 2:12:15| Yes, we want to encourage you to, and thank you, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7935)|
| 2:12:18| Please, we're asking you not to be redundant and repeat what the speaker before you has said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7938)|
| 2:12:23| Also, we're going to ask you not to make statements about personal matters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7943)|
| 2:12:29| or to address someone in a negative way personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7949)|
| 2:12:32| Please address your remarks to the issue at hand, and please do not, we're asking you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7952)|
| 2:12:38| please do not get personal or make personal statements about individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7958)|
| 2:12:42| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7962)|
| 2:12:44| Yes, because I don't think this will be accepted as a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7964)|
| 2:12:48| I'd like to make a substitute motion that we have the plan as proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7968)|
| 2:12:57| but with the addition under the nature of plan and legal effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7977)|
| 2:13:02| and I'll read this since there's been a revision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7982)|
| 2:13:04| and I think all the commissioners have received this already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7984)|
| 2:13:07| It says this plan and the principles, objectives, policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7987)|
| 2:13:11| and guidelines included herein are advisory in nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7991)|
| 2:13:15| and constitute non-binding recommendations for consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7995)|
| 2:13:19| in connection with development of steeply sloped areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=7999)|
| 2:13:23| While this plan is being adopted as an amendment to the Knoxville-Knox County General Plan 2033,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8003)|
| 2:13:31| it is intended to provide background information and supplemental information of an advisory nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8011)|
| 2:13:37| and to serve as a guide to future NPC staff recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8017)|
| 2:13:41| but it is not intended to form an official part of the general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8021)|
| 2:13:45| which would be binding on future land uses decided by the City Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8025)|
| 2:13:51| County Commission, NPC, the city and county boards of zoning appeals pursuant to the TCA 13-3-303.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8031)|
| 2:14:01| Any comparable provisions of the Knoxville-Knox County General Plan 2033 or sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8041)|
| 2:14:06| which relate to the hillside and ridgetop protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8046)|
| 2:14:10| shall also be considered advisory and consistent with this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8050)|
| 2:14:15| That's my substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8055)|
| 2:14:17| Now, let me tell you why I'm doing this, because it sounds like we're trying to throw a Trojan horse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8057)|
| 2:14:23| into the plan that we're making, and it really isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8063)|
| 2:14:30| And I'm perfectly willing to listen to some revisions of the language if we need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8070)|
| 2:14:36| If it really came down to it, I would be willing to drop the last sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8076)|
| 2:14:41| This is a revision of the one that many of you may have seen that came out last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8081)|
| 2:14:47| And you say, why are we doing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8087)|
| 2:14:51| And, you know, that arcane TCA 13-3-303 basically says that if the local legislative body adopts a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8091)|
| 2:15:06| that the board of zoning appeals in exercising its power, the planning commission, the legislative body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8106)|
| 2:15:12| the zoning commission on matters other than variances must be consistent with the general regional plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8112)|
| 2:15:19| And if this hill slopes and ridgetop plan is part of the general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8119)|
| 2:15:28| and it is part of the general plan and not an amendment to it and not advisory, then it's binding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8128)|
| 2:15:35| We've tied the hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8135)|
| 2:15:37| We've lost any ability really to appeal things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8137)|
| 2:15:41| And I think after listening to all the meetings we've had, all the discussions we've had with the facilitator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8141)|
| 2:15:50| the one theme I think that came out of all of this is that this is a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8150)|
| 2:15:56| and that you can bring this to either the board of zoning appeals or the county commission for appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8156)|
| 2:16:03| That's one thing that it sounded like we all agreed on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8163)|
| 2:16:08| This amendment that we're making is not intended to subvert anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8168)|
| 2:16:14| It's just making it absolutely clear that this is advisory and it needs to be non-binding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8174)|
| 2:16:22| There's amendments that are made to sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8182)|
| 2:16:25| There are amendments that are made to general plans that are advisory in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8185)|
| 2:16:30| The problem is, is if this is taken to a court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8190)|
| 2:16:33| is that the judge needs to understand what the intention was of the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8193)|
| 2:16:38| Do they intend to make this binding or do they intend to make it advisory where there is an appeal process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8198)|
| 2:16:45| And I know that the argument, one of the arguments that's going to be made with this is that it's already in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8205)|
| 2:16:53| where it's a binding, that it's non-binding and that there's an appeal process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8213)|
| 2:17:01| If that's the case and that's the intention when we pass this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8221)|
| 2:17:06| then let's just go ahead and state it absolutely clearly that this is advisory and it's non-binding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8226)|
| 2:17:13| that we are going to allow people to be able to appeal this to another body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8233)|
| 2:17:19| And if because of the esoteric and arcane nature of legalese,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8239)|
| 2:17:25| if this is binding and a judge did rule it was binding or he thought it might be binding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8245)|
| 2:17:30| let's make it absolutely clear as the legislative body that we don't want this to be binding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8250)|
| 2:17:35| that we do want there to be an appeals process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8255)|
| 2:17:39| And that's the sole reason for doing this is that if there is a lawsuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8259)|
| 2:17:45| it gives the judges and the legal system the intention of what this body is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8265)|
| 2:17:51| Now, if the intention is just to close the door and not have that option open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8271)|
| 2:17:58| then I think we should vote this down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8278)|
| 2:18:00| But if we want to leave the option open, we need to go ahead and adopt this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8280)|
| 2:18:06| If there's some objection to some of the language in there, I think that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8286)|
| 2:18:11| I'm willing to drop a sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8291)|
| 2:18:12| I'm willing to change it some, but I just think we need to make it absolutely clear that it's advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8292)|
| 2:18:17| And people may say, well, why do we need this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8297)|
| 2:18:20| Any of you that watched the Tennessee Vanderbilt football game on Saturday saw that there was an error made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8300)|
| 2:18:26| with an original call, but the referees had an appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8306)|
| 2:18:32| And when it was reviewed, the right call was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8312)|
| 2:18:36| What I'm asking with this is let's leave that appeal process open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8316)|
| 2:18:41| so an elective legislative body can look at a ruling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8321)|
| 2:18:45| and this could be either for an ordinary citizen or it could be for a developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8325)|
| 2:18:50| Let's leave that option open so they can bring that to either the BCA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8330)|
| 2:18:55| or they can bring it to this body for a ruling by elected people that represent the citizens of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8335)|
| 2:19:01| Now, that doesn't mean that this is still not a valuable plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8341)|
| 2:19:08| What it means is that when a landowner or a developer wants to come to the NPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8348)|
| 2:19:15| they know what the ground rules are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8355)|
| 2:19:17| They know not what they're up against necessarily, but they know what the intention is through the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8357)|
| 2:19:23| They know that they're going to have to state their case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8363)|
| 2:19:26| They're going to have to make their arguments, because this is the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8366)|
| 2:19:30| This is the general plan that we're putting in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8370)|
| 2:19:33| We're advising people ahead of time how this is going to be looked at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8373)|
| 2:19:36| because if this passes, this is the will of the people on what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8376)|
| 2:19:41| But I think we need to make it clear, and this was the theme that we heard again and again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8381)|
| 2:19:46| when we had the facilitator here through the five or six meetings that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8386)|
| 2:19:49| We wanted to keep that appeal process open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8389)|
| 2:19:52| This amendment allows this appeal process to be open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8392)|
| 2:19:56| Those of you who read the previous one, there were parts that you may not like about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8396)|
| 2:19:59| I think we revised that down to make it clear now that we're not trying to subvert something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8399)|
| 2:20:05| that we're not trying to eliminate something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8405)|
| 2:20:07| We're not trying to void something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8407)|
| 2:20:09| We're just trying to make it clear that this plan is advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8409)|
| 2:20:13| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8413)|
| 2:20:14| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8414)|
| 2:20:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8415)|
| 2:20:16| Motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8416)|
| 2:20:17| We want to have the public portion of this amendment, the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8417)|
| 2:20:25| And, again, you will have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8425)|
| 2:20:27| Jamie Dobbs, if you would come to the podium, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8427)|
| 2:20:30| and give us your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8430)|
| 2:20:33| And you will have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8433)|
| 2:20:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8434)|
| 2:20:35| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8435)|
| 2:20:36| My name is Jamie Dobbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8436)|
| 2:20:37| I'm president of the League of Women Voters of Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8437)|
| 2:20:40| I live at 2509 Lakefront Drive in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8440)|
| 2:20:44| And speaking for the members of the League, I want to say we give you great appreciation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8444)|
| 2:20:51| for bearing out through all this time all these deliberations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8451)|
| 2:20:57| We would call upon you to approve the plan as it was amended prior to this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8457)|
| 2:21:06| And that's really we appreciate your time and effort in all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8466)|
| 2:21:12| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8472)|
| 2:21:14| Our next speaker is Rick Harbin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8474)|
| 2:21:19| Mr. Harbin, if you would give us your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8479)|
| 2:21:21| And you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8481)|
| 2:21:23| My name is Rick Harbin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8483)|
| 2:21:24| I live at 7615 Rio Grande Drive in Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8484)|
| 2:21:30| I've been a real estate or in the real estate developing business my entire life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8490)|
| 2:21:38| And I've been indirectly related in following this hillside plan since more than a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8498)|
| 2:21:46| I remember coming to the county commission meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8506)|
| 2:21:51| I believe it was October of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8511)|
| 2:21:54| And this thing has lingered on many months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8514)|
| 2:21:57| And I know that you feel wore out on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8517)|
| 2:22:01| And I know that you want to get it off your desk and make a ruling on it and go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8521)|
| 2:22:08| But I'm here to plead with you to make a better decision than this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8528)|
| 2:22:16| This plan puts me in the mind of our national health care bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8536)|
| 2:22:22| It started out with a good intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8542)|
| 2:22:26| And the way it was pushed through, it's helped a few at everybody else's expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8546)|
| 2:22:34| What I would really like for you to understand, and I know you've heard this for a year now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8554)|
| 2:22:43| but there are some simple things on this plan that can be modified to turn this into a better deal for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8563)|
| 2:22:53| Right now you've got a lot of opposition because of two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8573)|
| 2:22:59| One, because of the economics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8579)|
| 2:23:02| And the other is because of property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8582)|
| 2:23:06| In regards to economics, the main thing starts with the 15% grade rule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8586)|
| 2:23:15| which is not a steep slope in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8595)|
| 2:23:21| It's actually very obsessive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8601)|
| 2:23:24| But the reason that that 15% is in this bill is so it can cover more area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8604)|
| 2:23:31| But that is where the complaint comes in at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8611)|
| 2:23:35| It covers currently approximately 35% of Knox County falls within the 15% slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8615)|
| 2:23:45| If you put this with the restrictions that are in this package, it makes it non-feasible to develop this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8625)|
| 2:23:57| By non-feasible, it costs too much money to develop this property to sell competitively on the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8637)|
| 2:24:06| And the market dictates everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8646)|
| 2:24:10| So when you have 35% of the market that you cannot develop feasibly, you're not going to develop on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8650)|
| 2:24:20| And Mr. Briggs a minute ago was talking about the appeals process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8660)|
| 2:24:25| There's not going to be any appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8665)|
| 2:24:28| We're going to have to develop elsewhere to meet the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8668)|
| 2:24:34| And then in regards to property rights, each of you know that you just can't take property value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8674)|
| 2:24:44| away from someone that owns this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8684)|
| 2:24:49| Generally, if you had to put a road through their property, you would pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8689)|
| 2:24:55| If you implement this and you take a person that has 50-acre track of hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8695)|
| 2:25:04| and they can only develop, if I'm not mistaken, it's 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8704)|
| 2:25:08| It might be a different figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8708)|
| 2:25:10| If you can only develop a small portion of it, what does it do to the value of the remainder of the land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8710)|
| 2:25:19| How can someone develop this property and be competitive with the market?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8719)|
| 2:25:26| You have about a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8726)|
| 2:25:27| It will not work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8727)|
| 2:25:29| I implore you to do what's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8729)|
| 2:25:33| You've got the makings of a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8733)|
| 2:25:36| If you can just come to compromise with the parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8736)|
| 2:25:42| The home builders and the realtors all are really hung up on the 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8742)|
| 2:25:49| Change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8749)|
| 2:25:50| And that cuts your problem in half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8750)|
| 2:25:52| And then negotiate with the property owners to give them something that will better the value of their land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8752)|
| 2:25:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8759)|
| 2:26:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8760)|
| 2:26:02| Next is Ken Goodwin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8762)|
| 2:26:07| Mr. Goodwin, if you would give us your address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8767)|
| 2:26:10| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8770)|
| 2:26:12| My name is Ken Goodwin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom111121part1?start=8772)|
