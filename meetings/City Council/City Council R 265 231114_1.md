| 2:00:36| We do need to use our land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7236)|
| 2:00:38| more efficiently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7238)|
| 2:00:40| in order not to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7240)|
| 2:00:42| an explosive place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7242)|
| 2:00:44| I applaud what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7244)|
| 2:00:46| we're doing together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7246)|
| 2:00:48| We should not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7248)|
| 2:00:50| let it go unnoticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7250)|
| 2:00:52| Those are comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7252)|
| 2:00:54| Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7254)|
| 2:00:56| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7256)|
| 2:00:58| A lot of the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7258)|
| 2:01:00| I think has been about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7260)|
| 2:01:02| what are we looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7262)|
| 2:01:04| the difference between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7264)|
| 2:01:06| R and 1 and R and 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7266)|
| 2:01:08| The discussion is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7268)|
| 2:01:10| really not about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7270)|
| 2:01:12| those zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7272)|
| 2:01:14| It's not about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7274)|
| 2:01:16| the size of somebody's yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7276)|
| 2:01:18| It's really about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7278)|
| 2:01:20| the infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7280)|
| 2:01:22| The missing middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7282)|
| 2:01:24| That's what came out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7284)|
| 2:01:26| in the Opticoste report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7286)|
| 2:01:28| We spent a lot of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7288)|
| 2:01:30| and a lot of effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7290)|
| 2:01:32| in having Opticoste come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7292)|
| 2:01:34| and do this review for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7294)|
| 2:01:36| and looking at what we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7296)|
| 2:01:38| missing in our housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7298)|
| 2:01:40| This is what they came up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7300)|
| 2:01:42| This is what they identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7302)|
| 2:01:44| I can understand that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7304)|
| 2:01:46| being some confusion about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7306)|
| 2:01:48| in the Opticoste report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7308)|
| 2:01:50| they didn't talk about R and 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7310)|
| 2:01:52| I think the myth is saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7312)|
| 2:01:54| maybe we should look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7314)|
| 2:01:56| I think within the confines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7316)|
| 2:01:58| of thinking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7318)|
| 2:02:00| what infrastructure we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7320)|
| 2:02:02| that can support it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7322)|
| 2:02:04| I don't necessarily have a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7324)|
| 2:02:06| with them looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7326)|
| 2:02:08| That doesn't necessarily mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7328)|
| 2:02:10| that if it comes back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7330)|
| 2:02:12| that I'm going to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7332)|
| 2:02:14| yes, this is a good idea or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7334)|
| 2:02:16| I think the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7336)|
| 2:02:18| is about infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7338)|
| 2:02:20| It's not about zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7340)|
| 2:02:22| I don't know if it was on this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7342)|
| 2:02:24| or a previous matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7344)|
| 2:02:26| but there was a discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7346)|
| 2:02:28| about what has driven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7348)|
| 2:02:30| affordability in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7350)|
| 2:02:32| over a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7352)|
| 2:02:34| If I remember that discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7354)|
| 2:02:36| we had correctly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7356)|
| 2:02:38| the biggest thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7358)|
| 2:02:40| that drives affordability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7360)|
| 2:02:42| is when you have the supply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7362)|
| 2:02:44| that can meet the demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7364)|
| 2:02:46| Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7366)|
| 2:02:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7368)|
| 2:02:49| We don't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7369)|
| 2:02:51| Asking the taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7371)|
| 2:02:53| to address this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7373)|
| 2:02:55| is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7375)|
| 2:02:57| you were just mentioning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7377)|
| 2:02:59| huge numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7379)|
| 2:03:01| of amount of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7381)|
| 2:03:03| that you'd have to do to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7383)|
| 2:03:05| I think you said $20 million, $30 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7385)|
| 2:03:07| to try to address the amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7387)|
| 2:03:09| of supply we would need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7389)|
| 2:03:11| We can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7391)|
| 2:03:13| What we need to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7393)|
| 2:03:15| is activate the private sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7395)|
| 2:03:17| to build and build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7397)|
| 2:03:18| which is along the corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7398)|
| 2:03:20| and then address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7400)|
| 2:03:22| while they're doing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7402)|
| 2:03:24| have them get incentives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7404)|
| 2:03:27| and build in affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7407)|
| 2:03:29| as they go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7409)|
| 2:03:31| Build in streetscapes as they go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7411)|
| 2:03:33| Build in the pedestrian infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7413)|
| 2:03:35| that we all want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7415)|
| 2:03:37| That's what we need to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7417)|
| 2:03:39| where you cannot use your car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7419)|
| 2:03:41| You can walk to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7421)|
| 2:03:43| You can go walk to home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7423)|
| 2:03:45| You can do all those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7425)|
| 2:03:46| but that's not what it needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7426)|
| 2:03:48| We've got to get incentives out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7428)|
| 2:03:50| to folks and get them to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7430)|
| 2:03:52| because folks the secret's out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7432)|
| 2:03:54| People know Knoxville is a great place to live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7434)|
| 2:03:56| and they want to move here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7436)|
| 2:03:58| and they're doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7438)|
| 2:04:00| I think the other thing to mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7440)|
| 2:04:02| is we have to have a diversity of housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7442)|
| 2:04:04| so that if you don't want to own a home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7444)|
| 2:04:06| that's fine, that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7446)|
| 2:04:08| But you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7448)|
| 2:04:10| I'm concerned about the wealth gap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7450)|
| 2:04:12| and folks that don't own property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7452)|
| 2:04:14| will end up falling further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7454)|
| 2:04:16| and further behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7456)|
| 2:04:18| Because like for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7458)|
| 2:04:20| and I think for many other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7460)|
| 2:04:22| your single biggest investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7462)|
| 2:04:24| is the house that you're paying a mortgage on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7464)|
| 2:04:26| And I want everyone to be able to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7466)|
| 2:04:28| not just a few people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7468)|
| 2:04:30| So we've got to lift all of those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7470)|
| 2:04:32| up at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7472)|
| 2:04:34| So there's a lot to do here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7474)|
| 2:04:36| and we're addressing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7476)|
| 2:04:38| and I appreciate you talking about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7478)|
| 2:04:40| because just thinking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7480)|
| 2:04:42| the Affordable Rental Housing Fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7482)|
| 2:04:44| in 2017 when I first came here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7484)|
| 2:04:46| and the Affordable Rental Housing units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7486)|
| 2:04:48| in the second district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7488)|
| 2:04:50| We now have hundreds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7490)|
| 2:04:52| and we've got at least three different sites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7492)|
| 2:04:54| where they're occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7494)|
| 2:04:56| And we're working on doing more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7496)|
| 2:04:58| and we need to do more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7498)|
| 2:05:00| This is something that has to be addressed citywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7500)|
| 2:05:02| No one gets out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7502)|
| 2:05:04| It happens everywhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7504)|
| 2:05:06| and we need to continue doing it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7506)|
| 2:05:08| But we've got to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7508)|
| 2:05:10| we're being smart about what we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7510)|
| 2:05:12| with our time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7512)|
| 2:05:14| and where we spend our money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7514)|
| 2:05:16| and looking at where we can have the most impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7516)|
| 2:05:18| is the best thing for us to do at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7518)|
| 2:05:20| We have a study from Opticos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7520)|
| 2:05:22| It gave us a report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7522)|
| 2:05:24| We should look into that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7524)|
| 2:05:26| but pay attention to where infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7526)|
| 2:05:28| can support these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7528)|
| 2:05:30| and I think we can make real progress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7530)|
| 2:05:32| and we've got to make that progress fast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7532)|
| 2:05:34| and as fast as we possibly can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7534)|
| 2:05:36| and I appreciate all of your efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7536)|
| 2:05:38| and all of the administration's efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7538)|
| 2:05:40| on bringing this stuff forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7540)|
| 2:05:42| so that we can try to take this on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7542)|
| 2:05:44| because it's a major lift| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7544)|
| 2:05:46| and we need to do it together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7546)|
| 2:05:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7548)|

| 2:06:06| that was up there earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7566)|
| 2:06:08| The missing middle proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7568)|
| 2:06:10| should include all of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7570)|
| 2:06:12| and the TDR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7572)|

| 2:06:16| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7576)|
| 2:06:18| There's nobody else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7578)|
| 2:06:20| with the light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7580)|
| 2:06:22| That should make it easy then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7582)|
| 2:06:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7584)|

| 2:07:12| can I request a recess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7632)|

| 2:07:48| respectfully requesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7668)|
| 2:07:50| Knoxville-Knox County Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7670)|
| 2:07:52| to consider and make a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7672)|
| 2:07:54| to City Council regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7674)|
| 2:07:56| the possible amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7676)|
| 2:07:58| of short-term rental permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7678)|
| 2:08:00| to include rental properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7680)|
| 2:08:02| located within residentially zoned districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7682)|
| 2:08:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7684)|
| 2:08:05| There's already a motion made and seconded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7685)|
| 2:08:07| so we'll go to the public forum people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7687)|
| 2:08:09| who signed up to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7689)|
| 2:08:11| First is one person signed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7691)|
| 2:08:12| to speak to the public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7692)|
| 2:08:14| Please state your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7694)|
| 2:08:16| and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7696)|
| 2:08:18| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7698)|
| 2:08:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7700)|
| 2:08:22| Awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7702)|
| 2:08:24| So Dustin Durham, 1422 Cornelius Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7704)|
| 2:08:26| And, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7706)|
| 2:08:28| I want to speak in favor of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7708)|
| 2:08:30| just because,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7710)|
| 2:08:32| so quick anecdote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7712)|
| 2:08:34| So a few,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7714)|
| 2:08:36| like a week ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7716)|
| 2:08:38| I went with some friends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7718)|
| 2:08:40| to the wonderful city of Denver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7720)|
| 2:08:42| It's a remarkable neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7722)|
| 2:08:44| in this duplex there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7724)|
| 2:08:46| And it was nice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7726)|
| 2:08:48| and I came back to Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7728)|
| 2:08:50| and I was very glad to be back home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7730)|
| 2:08:52| And so I love Denver,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7732)|
| 2:08:54| but I don't have any attachment to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7734)|
| 2:08:56| and I don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7736)|
| 2:08:58| and I put this in air quotes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7738)|
| 2:09:00| I don't care about Denver| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7740)|
| 2:09:02| because I don't live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7742)|
| 2:09:04| So I understand the concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7744)|
| 2:09:06| a lot of times with short-term rentals, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7746)|
| 2:09:08| Because we want our neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7748)|
| 2:09:10| to be filled with neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7750)|
| 2:09:12| so short-term rentals are allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7752)|
| 2:09:14| And my understanding of this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7754)|
| 2:09:16| is that it is just allowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7756)|
| 2:09:18| renters like me to have the same legal rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7758)|
| 2:09:20| with landlord permission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7760)|
| 2:09:22| to, in a scenario like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7762)|
| 2:09:24| when I go to Denver| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7764)|
| 2:09:26| or if I go home for Christmas or Thanksgiving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7766)|
| 2:09:28| if my landlord would allow me to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7768)|
| 2:09:30| I can rent out my apartment for a few days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7770)|
| 2:09:32| to make a little extra income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7772)|
| 2:09:34| I work for a non-profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7774)|
| 2:09:36| I don't make that much money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7776)|
| 2:09:38| Lord knows how much rent's going to increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7778)|
| 2:09:40| over the next few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7780)|
| 2:09:43| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7783)|
| 2:09:45| given that that's what this resolution says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7785)|
| 2:09:47| I really think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7787)|
| 2:09:49| it needs to be put forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7789)|
| 2:09:51| because what I've experienced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7791)|
| 2:09:53| is that there seems to be this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7793)|
| 2:09:55| mis-equating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7795)|
| 2:09:57| of short-term rental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7797)|
| 2:09:59| and long-term rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7799)|
| 2:10:01| And so we're always careful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7801)|
| 2:10:03| about protecting our neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7803)|
| 2:10:05| from short-term rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7805)|
| 2:10:07| But again, it's already legal for homeowners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7807)|
| 2:10:09| so why is it any different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7809)|
| 2:10:10| if I have a short-term rental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7810)|
| 2:10:12| At the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7812)|
| 2:10:14| there's no evidence that shows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7814)|
| 2:10:16| that renters like me are less mature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7816)|
| 2:10:18| or less responsible than homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7818)|
| 2:10:20| There is no evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7820)|
| 2:10:22| to show that we're less invested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7822)|
| 2:10:24| in our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7824)|
| 2:10:26| I've lived in Knoxville for 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7826)|
| 2:10:28| Again, I serve on our transportation authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7828)|
| 2:10:30| I love Knoxville to my core,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7830)|
| 2:10:32| but I am broke| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7832)|
| 2:10:34| and cannot afford a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7834)|
| 2:10:36| And I like where I live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7836)|
| 2:10:38| I've lucked out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7838)|
| 2:10:40| in a neighborhood who has provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7840)|
| 2:10:42| a fairly affordable rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7842)|
| 2:10:44| I put that in air quotes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7844)|
| 2:10:46| but again, who knows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7846)|
| 2:10:48| how it's going to go up in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7848)|
| 2:10:50| I think that there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7850)|
| 2:10:52| an outdated and quite frankly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7852)|
| 2:10:54| unfair assumption still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7854)|
| 2:10:56| that renters are 18-year-olds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7856)|
| 2:10:58| that go out and party every night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7858)|
| 2:11:00| and risk burning the neighborhood down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7860)|
| 2:11:02| Many of us who are renters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7862)|
| 2:11:04| again, I believe it's something like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7864)|
| 2:11:06| 51% of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7866)|
| 2:11:08| where people like me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7868)|
| 2:11:10| it's just the market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7870)|
| 2:11:12| has screwed us over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7872)|
| 2:11:14| And so we're just trying to get by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7874)|
| 2:11:16| and we're trying to do everything we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7876)|
| 2:11:18| I'm involved in my neighborhood organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7878)|
| 2:11:20| in Old North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7880)|
| 2:11:22| I freaking love this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7882)|
| 2:11:24| And any way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7884)|
| 2:11:26| that we can change our policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7886)|
| 2:11:28| to make me equal under the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7888)|
| 2:11:30| I think should be a no-brainer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7890)|
| 2:11:32| Because right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7892)|
| 2:11:34| something like this to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7894)|
| 2:11:36| is a glaring and abhorrent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7896)|
| 2:11:38| dereliction of duty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7898)|
| 2:11:40| equally as homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7900)|
| 2:11:42| And as it has been mentioned before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7902)|
| 2:11:44| there's nothing that makes you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7904)|
| 2:11:47| a better person as a homeowner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7907)|
| 2:11:49| And at some point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7909)|
| 2:11:51| every homeowner was a renter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7911)|
| 2:11:53| most likely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7913)|
| 2:11:55| unless you lived at home your whole life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7915)|
| 2:11:57| So yeah, I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7917)|
| 2:11:59| the argument and the concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7919)|
| 2:12:01| about short-term rentals itself is valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7921)|
| 2:12:03| But given that this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7923)|
| 2:12:05| you have to get landlord permission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7925)|
| 2:12:07| and that we already allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7927)|
| 2:12:08| short-term rentals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7928)|
| 2:12:10| in residential neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7930)|
| 2:12:12| If you're a homeowner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7932)|
| 2:12:14| then just giving folks like me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7934)|
| 2:12:16| that same equal right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7936)|
| 2:12:18| should be a no-brainer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7938)|
| 2:12:20| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7940)|

| 2:13:08| Community Forum was very involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7988)|
| 2:13:10| in the drafting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7990)|
| 2:13:12| of the short-term rentals ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7992)|
| 2:13:14| in 2016| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7994)|
| 2:13:16| and has been very concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7996)|
| 2:13:18| about the enforcement of the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=7998)|
| 2:13:20| since it went into effect in 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8000)|
| 2:13:22| Throughout that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8002)|
| 2:13:24| there was much discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8004)|
| 2:13:26| and input from the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8006)|
| 2:13:28| regarding providing safeguards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8008)|
| 2:13:30| for residents in residential neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8010)|
| 2:13:32| Included in that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8012)|
| 2:13:34| was the inclusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8014)|
| 2:13:36| of a requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8016)|
| 2:13:38| that the short-term rental property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8018)|
| 2:13:40| must be occupied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8020)|
| 2:13:42| as the owner's principal residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8022)|
| 2:13:44| The current ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8024)|
| 2:13:46| allows a Type I permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8026)|
| 2:13:48| to be issued only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8028)|
| 2:13:50| to an owner of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8030)|
| 2:13:52| in residentially zoned districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8032)|
| 2:13:54| A person can only have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8034)|
| 2:13:56| one Type I permit in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8036)|
| 2:13:58| An owner must prove ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8038)|
| 2:14:00| The proposed amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8040)|
| 2:14:02| would allow renters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8042)|
| 2:14:04| lessees of properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8044)|
| 2:14:06| to be issued permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8046)|
| 2:14:08| for short-term rental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8048)|
| 2:14:10| in residentially zoned districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8050)|
| 2:14:12| Would a renter have to produce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8052)|
| 2:14:14| a lease to obtain a permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8054)|
| 2:14:16| This proposed amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8056)|
| 2:14:18| would significantly weaken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8058)|
| 2:14:20| the owner-occupied requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8060)|
| 2:14:22| by allowing a renter lessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8062)|
| 2:14:24| to have the permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8064)|
| 2:14:26| not the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8066)|
| 2:14:28| If this amendment is adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8068)|
| 2:14:30| would an owner of more than one rental property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8070)|
| 2:14:32| thus be allowed to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8072)|
| 2:14:34| multiple renters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8074)|
| 2:14:36| lessees who have operating permits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8076)|
| 2:14:38| Would a renter be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8078)|
| 2:14:40| to have family members of the owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8080)|
| 2:14:42| and thus have a potentially large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8082)|
| 2:14:44| business operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8084)|

| 2:14:48| The owner-occupied requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8088)|
| 2:14:50| was designed to offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8090)|
| 2:14:52| a level of comfort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8092)|
| 2:14:54| to adjacent property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8094)|
| 2:14:56| who would know the owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8096)|
| 2:14:58| and resident of the house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8098)|

| 2:15:02| The idea was that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8102)|
| 2:15:04| owners having invested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8104)|
| 2:15:06| in the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8106)|
| 2:15:08| would be dealing with somebody else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8108)|
| 2:15:10| the lessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8110)|
| 2:15:12| if there was a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8112)|
| 2:15:14| The neighbor might not even know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8114)|

| 2:15:44| very difficult to enforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8144)|
| 2:15:46| Allowing renters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8146)|

| 2:17:19| this definitely is taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8239)|
| 2:17:21| inventory away from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8241)|

| 2:18:28| To an extent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8308)|
| 2:18:29| the owner is responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8309)|

| 2:22:07| this, so I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8527)|
| 2:22:08| going to bring this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8528)|
| 2:22:09| up for our council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8529)|

| 2:22:20| providing access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8540)|

| 2:22:22| this is not, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8542)|
| 2:22:23| some of the comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8543)|
| 2:22:24| and concerns are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8544)|
| 2:22:25| legitimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8545)|
| 2:22:26| This is not about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8546)|
| 2:22:27| expanding the program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8547)|

| 2:22:29| enforcement protocol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8549)|
| 2:22:30| So I want to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8550)|
| 2:22:31| sure that's clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8551)|
| 2:22:32| I'm not advocating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8552)|
| 2:22:33| for foreign owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8553)|

| 2:22:49| live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8569)|
| 2:22:50| Actually, this came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8570)|
| 2:22:51| from a constituent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8571)|
| 2:22:52| who brought this to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8572)|
| 2:22:53| me, and he said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8573)|
| 2:22:54| he had a renter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8574)|
| 2:22:55| who wanted to earn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8575)|
| 2:22:56| money to pay rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8576)|
| 2:22:57| She went away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8577)|
| 2:22:58| once a month to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8578)|
| 2:22:59| visit a relative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8579)|
| 2:23:00| and wanted to rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8580)|
| 2:23:01| the home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8581)|
| 2:23:02| He trusted her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8582)|
| 2:23:03| and wanted her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8583)|
| 2:23:04| to have the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8584)|
| 2:23:05| opportunity because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8585)|
| 2:23:06| he lived in the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8586)|
| 2:23:07| neighborhood, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8587)|
| 2:23:08| he could do it on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8588)|
| 2:23:09| the weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8589)|
| 2:23:10| And she could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8590)|
| 2:23:11| with his approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8591)|
| 2:23:12| do it responsibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8592)|
| 2:23:13| and earn enough money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8593)|
| 2:23:14| to pay for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8594)|
| 2:23:15| whole month's rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8595)|
| 2:23:16| And he thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8596)|
| 2:23:17| you know, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8597)|
| 2:23:18| ridiculous that I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8598)|
| 2:23:19| do it, but I trust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8599)|
| 2:23:20| her, and I'm going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8600)|
| 2:23:21| to authorize her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8601)|
| 2:23:22| to do this, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8602)|
| 2:23:23| she shouldn't be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8603)|
| 2:23:24| able to earn money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8604)|
| 2:23:25| for her rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8605)|
| 2:23:26| So that's where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8606)|
| 2:23:27| this is coming from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8607)|
| 2:23:28| and the intent of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8608)|
| 2:23:29| this, so I want you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8609)|
| 2:23:30| to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8610)|
| 2:23:31| that's really clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8611)|
| 2:23:32| where this is coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8612)|
| 2:23:33| from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8613)|
| 2:23:34| Two of my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8614)|
| 2:23:35| neighbors, two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8615)|
| 2:23:36| of the five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8616)|
| 2:23:37| neighbors that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8617)|
| 2:23:38| surround me are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8618)|
| 2:23:39| renters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8619)|
| 2:23:40| They're great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8620)|
| 2:23:41| I rented in five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8621)|
| 2:23:42| places across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8622)|
| 2:23:43| the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8623)|
| 2:23:44| I think it's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8624)|
| 2:23:45| right thing to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8625)|
| 2:23:46| and where possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8626)|
| 2:23:47| where possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8627)|
| 2:23:48| renters deserve the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8628)|
| 2:23:49| same rights as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8629)|
| 2:23:50| property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8630)|
| 2:23:51| So this is an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8631)|
| 2:23:52| opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8632)|
| 2:23:53| A lot of times we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8633)|
| 2:23:54| restricted by state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8634)|
| 2:23:55| law, and so like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8635)|
| 2:23:56| the last resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8636)|
| 2:23:57| I took a careful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8637)|
| 2:23:58| look at what is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8638)|
| 2:23:59| some flexibility that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8639)|
| 2:24:00| we could give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8640)|
| 2:24:01| renters that don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8641)|
| 2:24:02| necessarily have it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8642)|
| 2:24:03| today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8643)|
| 2:24:04| And so one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8644)|
| 2:24:05| things to note is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8645)|
| 2:24:06| that this is already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=8646)|

| 2:35:27| So I was like, here we go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9327)|
| 2:35:30| anyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9330)|
| 2:35:31| there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9331)|
| 2:35:33| Two houses at the end of my street that are Airbnb and they're in a commercial zone. So there's nothing we do about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9333)|
| 2:35:39| It's allowed in the current ordinance. We had a workshop not too long ago about Airbnb and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9339)|
| 2:35:45| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9345)|
| 2:35:46| overwhelming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9346)|
| 2:35:47| Thoughts were not to change what we had and or make it stricter not to open it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9347)|
| 2:35:55| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9355)|
| 2:35:56| Anyway, there are these houses at the end of my street and they are empty except for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9356)|
| 2:36:02| Pretty much football games. They're not housing people and yet everybody wants to live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9362)|
| 2:36:07| In my neighborhood, they want to live there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9367)|
| 2:36:10| They want to live right on the you know, the number 20 bus, but they can't because those are run as hotels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9370)|
| 2:36:16| But they're not hotels. So I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9376)|
| 2:36:20| And then you go the other direction on the number 22, and there's a couple of other houses same thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9380)|
| 2:36:25| They're grandfathered and they're run as Airbnb and no one lives in them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9385)|
| 2:36:31| I'm just not a fan of Airbnb. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9391)|
| 2:36:35| rented an Airbnb in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9395)|
| 2:36:39| Nashville to take my child to a medical procedure there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9399)|
| 2:36:41| So I booked a week and then we were this is several many years back and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9401)|
| 2:36:48| We were let in through the back door and it was real clear that it was surreptitious that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9408)|
| 2:36:53| Renter was not supposed to be renting out that Airbnb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9413)|
| 2:36:56| But here I was in Nashville with my family. My child was scheduled for a surgery at Vanderbilt and I'm like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9416)|
| 2:37:03| Okay, we're just gonna go with it here. And so we did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9423)|
| 2:37:07| But that seems to be you know, the thing with Airbnb things aren't on the up and up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9427)|
| 2:37:12| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9432)|
| 2:37:13| Happened to check into a Hampton recently when I went away to a conference and the people in front of me were so grateful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9433)|
| 2:37:19| To that hotel for finding them a room because they've gone to an Airbnb and it had been a bad experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9439)|
| 2:37:24| So that's not what you're here to talk about tonight. I just have had several bad experiences with Airbnb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9444)|
| 2:37:29| I love regulation and there doesn't seem to be any but what my constituents resoundingly ask is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9449)|
| 2:37:35| Why doesn't the city do a better job of enforcing what we have and what the constituency wanted in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9455)|
| 2:37:41| 2017 was to ban them all together. So what we have on the current ordinance we have is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9461)|
| 2:37:48| compromise ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9468)|
| 2:37:50| And I just I can't support it. I don't want to open it up further. So that's that's it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9470)|
| 2:37:58| Vice mayor Roberto Thank You mayor. I think the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9478)|
| 2:38:04| the first thing to think about here is that I think the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9484)|
| 2:38:08| Intent of this and the place that it's coming from my colleague councilmember Smith is a very good place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9488)|
| 2:38:14| I think he's identifying something where he thinks that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9494)|
| 2:38:17| This will solve a problem and give renters something that they can get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9497)|
| 2:38:23| You know where they can make some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9503)|
| 2:38:26| Inroads and maybe having some profitability in the branch. So I think he's coming from a very good place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9506)|
| 2:38:32| when I look at trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9512)|
| 2:38:34| To| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9514)|
| 2:38:35| Figure out where I can be on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9515)|
| 2:38:37| I think the first thing I come to is the workshop that I think a lot of you have talked about and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9517)|
| 2:38:43| In that workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9523)|
| 2:38:45| And I'll just kind of ask mr. Frost this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9525)|
| 2:38:48| My understanding with the state's preemption on this issue. Is that any change at all whatsoever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9528)|
| 2:38:56| Whether we're adding rights taking away rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9536)|
| 2:39:00| Changing a comma| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9540)|
| 2:39:02| Anything we did on in with our short-term rental ordinance creates a new class of permits for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9542)|
| 2:39:10| Short-term rentals, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9550)|
| 2:39:13| Thank You vice mayor this afternoon. I went over some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9553)|
| 2:39:17| What I saw to be big issues on the agenda and I was rereading this and I was thinking about actually back in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9557)|
| 2:39:24| 2017 when there was a discussion we created our council created three different types of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9564)|
| 2:39:30| Permits and one type was the type 3 and that was for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9570)|
| 2:39:35| Air short-term rentals that were in existence prior to the ordinance. So they didn't have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9575)|
| 2:39:42| license at the time and there was a specific type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9582)|
| 2:39:46| Ordinance created for them. They were the type 3 ordinance, which is still on the books, but by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9586)|
| 2:39:52| Operation there should be no valid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9592)|
| 2:39:55| Type 3 permits out there now. I do recall at the time a conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9595)|
| 2:40:01| that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9601)|
| 2:40:03| When| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9603)|
| 2:40:05| A type of permit is created that perhaps it probably should be a new type of permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9605)|
| 2:40:13| Because it could affect the other permits in place a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9613)|
| 2:40:18| because of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9618)|
| 2:40:20| You know what you referenced to earlier, like I said, I was just reviewing the matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9620)|
| 2:40:25| Today and I started thinking more about the 2017| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9625)|
| 2:40:31| Discussion of it. I don't know if the law director has any recollection of that either or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9631)|
| 2:40:40| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9640)|
| 2:40:42| Okay. Well, I remember that from our workshop and that's that's what we were presented with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9642)|
| 2:40:47| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9647)|
| 2:40:48| We would be creating a new class that makes it more difficult for enforcement. So that's an issue that I think we have to think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9648)|
| 2:40:54| about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9654)|
| 2:40:58| Studies have shown that the increase in short-term rentals is most felt by renters because it takes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9658)|
| 2:41:06| Available properties away from renters. So by expanding short-term rentals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9666)|
| 2:41:11| I'm afraid that we're going to be doing the opposite of what we're intending to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9671)|
| 2:41:15| With creating more affordability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9675)|
| 2:41:19| Renter agreements right now don't allow for this type of thing to occur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9679)|
| 2:41:24| So they would have to amend their rental agreements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9684)|
| 2:41:27| What owner do you think is not going to ask for increased rent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9687)|
| 2:41:31| Because they're getting there's profit being made on the rentals that they own. So I think you're gonna see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9691)|
| 2:41:37| This go in a direction that we don't that we're we've expressed multiple times here that that's not where we want to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9697)|
| 2:41:46| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9706)|
| 2:41:47| The other thing I wanted to mention do we got about a minute left?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9707)|
| 2:41:51| I'll ask miss ball this question when we had the workshop on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9711)|
| 2:41:57| short-term rentals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9717)|
| 2:41:58| We were had a lot of discussion about enforcement and there were some really good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9718)|
| 2:42:03| Changes that came from that discussion since we can't amend our way out of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9723)|
| 2:42:09| You know situation. We're really lucky that we have the ordinance that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9729)|
| 2:42:13| But we did make some enforcement decisions and some of those were that when you renew you had to show proof that it's your primary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9733)|
| 2:42:20| Residence again. Well, you had to sign an affidavit saying hey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9740)|
| 2:42:24| I'm this is my primary residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9744)|
| 2:42:26| And so those are the kinds of enforcement tools that I know have been deployed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9746)|
| 2:42:30| Since the workshop and and I commend that work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9750)|
| 2:42:34| But just wanted to maybe give you an opportunity to talk to us about what you're seeing with those enforcement techniques| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9754)|
| 2:42:40| Since we had that workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9760)|
| 2:42:43| Thank you for the question we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9763)|
| 2:42:46| Have implemented an affidavit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=9766)|

| 2:46:56| I was attached to the idea if homeowners can do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=10016)|
| 2:47:01| Why can't renters and then thinking about the thought of an additional income?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=10021)|

| 2:47:13| Earlier, I was saying that we're basing a lot of our decisions on fear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=10033)|
| 2:47:17| Like what if this happens then maybe this will happen. This is a situation where we've seen the problems with short-term rentals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=10037)|
| 2:47:24| So I think I'm pulling back from my support of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=10044)|

| 2:50:13| I believe the city needs a more robust enforcement of its EEO and anti-discrimination policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=10213)|

| 2:50:30| It's a great step towards improving accountability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=10230)|

| 2:51:09| The Civil Service Merit Board better focus on its core charter mandated duties of safeguarding merit system principles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=10269)|

| 2:51:25| For the merit board personnel to also be tasked with enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=10285)|
| 2:51:29| This leads to scenarios where board personnel are effectively investigators judge and jury| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=10289)|

| 2:51:53| An analogy would be like the pension board staff for instance had been given responsibility for administering the deferred compensation plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=10313)|
| 2:52:00| Decades ago and then that responsibility was shifted to the benefits department that shift would not compromise the integrity of the pension system in any way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=10320)|
| 2:52:09| lastly, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=10329)|
| 2:52:10| Do not believe this comfort, but this recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=10330)|

| 3:07:37| Which represents general government employees for the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11257)|
| 3:07:42| While the recommendations associated with these ordinance changes have been available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11262)|
| 3:07:47| Several weeks the actual ordinances themselves have only been available since last Thursday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11267)|

| 3:08:34| And while we appreciate the work that both outside council and MTAS provided towards these recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11314)|
| 3:08:41| We do feel like we did miss out on some opportunities for internal collaboration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11321)|
| 3:08:46| Obviously in such a limited time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11326)|
| 3:08:48| We haven't received feed feedback from a majority of members, but did want to share what we have received up to this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11328)|
| 3:08:55| Most of the feedback we have received from employees who have commented is at this point in opposition to several of the proposed changes being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11335)|
| 3:09:02| presented tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11342)|
| 3:09:04| Though we did have an employee who was neutral and really didn't have a strong view either for or against the proposed changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11344)|
| 3:09:11| There are two consistent themes and what I'm hearing from employees who are in opposition to the changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11351)|
| 3:09:16| and that's the concern about the lack of Civil Service Merit Board oversight and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11356)|
| 3:09:21| Potential charter click conflicts with the proposed ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11361)|
| 3:09:25| To drill down on these concerns. I believe my following question is the core of the issue employees are trying to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11365)|
| 3:09:33| the Charter in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11373)|

| 3:09:48| In 1003 F-4 to make any investigation it deems necessary concerning the administration of personnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11388)|
| 3:09:57| In Charter 231. It also says that when any power is placed with a board it shall be their exclusive jurisdiction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11397)|
| 3:10:05| How does this proposed ordinance change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11405)|
| 3:10:08| Giving the mayor through her appointee the director of HR the ability to develop an EEO program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11408)|
| 3:10:14| How does that not conflict with the provisions of Charter, thank you for your time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11414)|

| 3:10:46| Because I definitely agree with both sets of speakers that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11446)|
| 3:10:52| Improvements are needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11452)|
| 3:10:54| but unfortunately, I feel that the process has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11454)|
| 3:11:00| Missed the mark a bit in terms of what was requested in the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11460)|
| 3:11:06| And the resolution that was introduced by City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11466)|
| 3:11:11| That I brought forward and Councilmember Fugate amended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11471)|
| 3:11:17| It was very clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11477)|
| 3:11:20| That it's thanks to the amendment that it's very important that we hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11480)|
| 3:11:27| from the Civil Service Merit Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11487)|
| 3:11:30| Throughout this process and that they are very much involved in this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11490)|
| 3:11:35| And so it's been very concerning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11495)|
| 3:11:40| To hear that since this was initiated two years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11500)|
| 3:11:45| that folks have not been involved over the last six months as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11505)|
| 3:11:50| Recommendations have come forward and ordinances have been proposed. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11510)|
| 3:11:56| Would like to see that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11516)|
| 3:11:59| Happen before we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11519)|
| 3:12:02| Do consider ordinance changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11522)|
| 3:12:07| I'd actually like to make a motion tonight that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11527)|
| 3:12:11| Send these to the Civil Service Merit Board and ask for a report back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11531)|
| 3:12:18| That we can consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11538)|
| 3:12:21| Alongside the recommendations that are coming from this third party council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11541)|
| 3:12:29| We got an initial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11549)|

| 3:12:44| The third party study or the ordinances that have been proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11564)|
| 3:12:52| So perhaps, you know we can have additional discussion and then I will hold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11572)|
| 3:12:58| And wait before I make that motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11578)|
| 3:13:02| Thank You councilmember Ryder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11582)|

| 3:13:15| So there were comments about charter changes, I'll just start with kind of the basics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11595)|
| 3:13:21| Some of the speakers referred to charter changes and some of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11601)|
| 3:13:26| Referred to ordinance changes this agenda item is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11606)|
| 3:13:32| Only an ordinance change because we can't change the Charter. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11612)|
| 3:13:37| Yes, ma'am. Dr. Kelly Drummond director of human resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11617)|
| 3:13:41| To answer that question. No| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11621)|
| 3:13:44| The Charter change and I'll leave to the legal individuals to talk with specifically about the Charter change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11624)|

| 3:13:55| Yes, ma'am. Okay, so there's no Charter. There's no changes to the Charter. There is no recommended changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11635)|
| 3:14:01| There's no recommendation to change anything in the Charter. That is correct, which would have to be voted on by the the voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11641)|
| 3:14:09| That is correct. Okay, so the ordinance change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11649)|
| 3:14:13| Is not changing anyone's civil service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11653)|

| 3:14:23| Currently it is divided among multiple entities when you look at EEO and affirmative action programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11663)|

| 3:15:06| When there have been issues or concerns dealing with issues not dealing with hiring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11706)|
| 3:15:11| Promotion or transfer it would come to human resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11711)|
| 3:15:16| So right now it's in multiple places, okay, so right now if I needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11716)|
| 3:15:23| Let's say something happened and I needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11723)|
| 3:15:27| Accommodations I as an employee for the city would say. Oh, I need to go talk to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11727)|

| 3:15:42| Decided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11742)|
| 3:15:44| That| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11744)|
| 3:15:46| My civil service something had been infringed upon that then I go to them. That's right. Yes, ma'am| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11746)|
| 3:15:53| I'm sorry. I can't do a good example of that. I can help you with an example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11753)|
| 3:15:58| So if you think about this from a thousand-foot point of view if I worked Steve King talked about working in engineering if I worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11758)|
| 3:16:04| In engineering and I wanted I was an engineering one for example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11764)|
| 3:16:09| And I wanted to get a promotion and I wanted to be in engineering to just using titles generically and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11769)|
| 3:16:16| When I went to get that promotion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11776)|
| 3:16:19| I was not chosen because of race because I'm a black female because of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11779)|
| 3:16:24| Protected class any of those types of things because I need another knee replacement any of those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11784)|
| 3:16:30| That would be a consideration of hiring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11790)|
| 3:16:33| promotion or transfer and it would go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11793)|
| 3:16:37| Specifically under charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11797)|
| 3:16:39| We would go specifically in dealing with civil service because that is a charter protected, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11799)|
| 3:16:48| Okay, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11808)|
| 3:16:50| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11810)|
| 3:16:51| So right now there's ADA then what type of complaints would an employee take to the law department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11811)|
| 3:16:57| The law department right now you can have options to go to the law department or you could go to civil service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11817)|
| 3:17:04| So it's kind of nebulous and how all of this works and that's what this ordinance is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11824)|
| 3:17:10| Asking to do it is not a charter change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11830)|
| 3:17:13| It is an ordinance change for HR to be a one-stop the initial stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11833)|
| 3:17:19| And it's the initial starting point. It is not the initial piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11839)|
| 3:17:23| That's going to determine all of the information, but it is a starting point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11843)|
| 3:17:28| So employees will not have to question. Who do I see? Where do I go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11848)|
| 3:17:32| Do I look at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11852)|
| 3:17:34| Administrative rule 15. Do I go to administrative rule 12? Do I go to any of those other things? So this is done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11854)|
| 3:17:41| specifically to help to become a clearinghouse as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11861)|
| 3:17:45| Starting point for all employees. It does not change any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11865)|
| 3:17:51| employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11871)|

| 3:17:54| So real quick in my 12 seconds left. Okay, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11874)|
| 3:17:59| If I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11879)|
| 3:18:00| The engineering example if I came if I if I decided hey, I was passed over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11880)|
| 3:18:06| I feel I deserve that promotion and I didn't get picked for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11886)|
| 3:18:10| You do not do anything in HR to determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11890)|
| 3:18:15| No, Lauren, you weren't wronged or yes, Lauren you were wronged. You say that issue takes you to civil service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11895)|
| 3:18:22| Not the law department. You you are a directional as to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11902)|
| 3:18:28| Who is dealing with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11908)|
| 3:18:30| Yes, ma'am| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11910)|
| 3:18:30| It would be you do have the right to go to civil service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11910)|
| 3:18:35| You can go to the law department as an HR in the clearinghouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11915)|
| 3:18:38| We are going to ensure that all of the communication goes where it needs to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11918)|
| 3:18:43| Civil service will know in that example the law department will know in that example and we will provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11923)|
| 3:18:50| Data and keeping up with this information, but yes, ma'am| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11930)|
| 3:18:53| It would still go to civil service and that specific incident so not someone who reports right a mayor. I'm sorry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11933)|
| 3:19:00| Yeah, good. I'm sorry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11940)|

| 3:19:29| Mr. Frost it's my understanding that in your role as council's attorney you had reviewed the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11969)|
| 3:19:37| with regard to this proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=11977)|

| 3:20:20| With the city, which I didn't know the background of it. Don't know it to this day. None of my business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12020)|

| 3:21:23| professionally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12083)|

| 3:21:50| I think what you heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12110)|
| 3:21:53| dr. Drummond say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12113)|
| 3:21:55| was important that a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12115)|

| 3:22:06| will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12126)|
| 3:22:08| protected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12128)|
| 3:22:10| Thank you very much for that I do think the starting place was just to look at what what was what was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12130)|
| 3:22:17| impact from the perspective of the Charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12137)|
| 3:22:21| The only other thing I would think just in a procedural matter is that these issues were as I understand it vetted and discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12141)|
| 3:22:27| With the Civic Civil Service Merit Board two times and both times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12147)|
| 3:22:32| They chose not to take any further action on it, and I think they were looking at what whether there were Charter issues as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12152)|
| 3:22:39| Anyway, I hope that helps add it to add to the discussion, but I appreciate the time. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12159)|

| 3:24:43| Yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12283)|
| 3:24:44| You have that for EEO and I cannot answer what is going on with ADA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12284)|
| 3:24:49| And I cannot answer fully with EEO what I can tell you that as we go through this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12289)|
| 3:24:56| And if City Council changes this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12296)|
| 3:25:00| Then this will be explained to employees as we connect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12300)|
| 3:25:04| one of the things that we need to make sure we do as a city is to make sure the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12304)|
| 3:25:10| Communication is open and that we are providing information to you all to the law department and to the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12310)|
| 3:25:17| So we will make sure through this ordinance that HR is doing so HR will be mandated to do so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12317)|
| 3:25:25| And so I'm glad to hear you you say that that information would be available and also council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12325)|
| 3:25:30| would be privy to some of the numbers because I think in the past and it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12330)|
| 3:25:36| Anything negative toward anyone when asked about numbers and complaints. It always seemed like it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12336)|
| 3:25:43| People really couldn't give you an answer to the number of complaints and those types of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12343)|
| 3:25:47| And so is there going to be a database?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12347)|
| 3:25:50| Who is going to be responsible for being the keeper of that information to be able to report that back out to council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12350)|
| 3:25:56| The Human Resource Department will do so we have a person that will specialize in data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12356)|
| 3:26:02| analysts and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12362)|
| 3:26:04| Analysis that person will keep up with that information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12364)|
| 3:26:07| What I would recommend is that on an annual basis if the council is open that we could possibly have a workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12367)|
| 3:26:14| Or something like that where we can talk about training that has gone on for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12374)|
| 3:26:19| orientation for new hires for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12379)|
| 3:26:22| supervisors for any of those types of things to let you know about any communication we've had and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12382)|
| 3:26:27| To also let you know about numbers of complaints. I would recommend and I would encourage you all to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12387)|
| 3:26:34| mandate and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12394)|
| 3:26:36| Compile me to come back before you all to provide that information on an annual basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12396)|
| 3:26:42| I think it's important for you to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12402)|
| 3:26:44| I think it's important for the mayor to know and we make sure that everyone is kept and made aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12404)|
| 3:26:50| Thank you. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12410)|

| 3:27:07| Yeah, I have a have a pretty good knowledge base and you know, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12427)|
| 3:27:14| I'm a believer in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12434)|
| 3:27:16| HR human resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12436)|
| 3:27:20| Overall because I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12440)|
| 3:27:23| HR is a navigation arm of any business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12443)|
| 3:27:27| it gives employees a direction and a path for support and I think to you know the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12447)|
| 3:27:34| Consolidation I do think the one-stop shop is critically important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12454)|
| 3:27:39| Because right now I think when questions arise or issues or conflicts or all of those things arise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12459)|
| 3:27:45| there's not a lot of clarity on who to go to where to go to and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12465)|
| 3:27:52| Who's going to provide that support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12472)|
| 3:27:55| At the same time HR annoys the principal's office and I think for a lot of people it's a bad word and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12475)|
| 3:28:03| It brings on a negative connotation, but at the end of the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12483)|
| 3:28:07| You know, it truly provides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12487)|
| 3:28:10| just what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12490)|
| 3:28:12| Dr. Drummond just said yeah onboarding and training learning and development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12492)|
| 3:28:16| Employee assistance programs. It's it's those types of resources. First of all that help mitigate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12496)|
| 3:28:24| Any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12504)|
| 3:28:26| Discrimination or EEOC issues and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12506)|
| 3:28:31| and with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12511)|
| 3:28:33| With that type of support inevitably builds confidence trust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12513)|
| 3:28:39| and and support among the entire employee base and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12519)|
| 3:28:45| Resources for best practice training for compliance training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12525)|
| 3:28:50| that at the end of the day, we hope would diminish the exposure of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12530)|
| 3:28:55| For any EEO violations and so I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12535)|
| 3:29:01| Having a robust department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12541)|
| 3:29:04| You know bringing these different entities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12544)|
| 3:29:08| Under the purview of a department. I mean, that's what HR is designed to do. And that's what it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12548)|
| 3:29:15| You know, that's what the structure is. And I think it's very clear that the requirements via the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12555)|
| 3:29:24| You know makes for more transparency makes for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12564)|
| 3:29:30| a very streamlined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12570)|
| 3:29:32| process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12572)|
| 3:29:34| and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12574)|
| 3:29:35| You know there have to be those notifications to the merit board to the law department, etc| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12575)|
| 3:29:42| and again the merit boards very you know, the the boundaries of higher fire transport and promote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12582)|
| 3:29:50| Are clear as well. So I do support this. I do think it's it's a bit of housekeeping. It probably should have been addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12590)|
| 3:29:58| When the decision was made by this council to establish the HR department, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12598)|
| 3:30:05| again, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12605)|
| 3:30:07| To have that really provides the resources to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12607)|
| 3:30:11| the government employees to give them the tools and the resources to be successful in their roles and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12611)|
| 3:30:18| as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12618)|
| 3:30:20| tools to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12620)|
| 3:30:23| To help them navigate any challenges that they might encounter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12623)|
| 3:30:28| Thank you, just a reminder to council if you do have questions for our for our outside counsel Devin Lyon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12628)|

| 3:30:39| That's your workshop on this topic and he was presented twice to the Civil Service Merit Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12639)|
| 3:30:45| as well, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12645)|
| 3:30:47| Just want to let you know council member Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12647)|
| 3:30:52| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12652)|
| 3:30:53| watched the last four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12653)|
| 3:30:55| Civil Service Merit Board meetings and lengthy discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12655)|
| 3:31:01| There's one part of this that is definitely cleaned up where one thing pointed to another department this pointed back to that department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12661)|
| 3:31:07| And so I think administratively I think I'm on board with cleaning it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12667)|
| 3:31:11| I did have a question because there is there's a constant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12671)|
| 3:31:16| line of questioning around does this conflict with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12676)|
| 3:31:20| Charter and mr. Frost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12680)|
| 3:31:23| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12683)|

| 3:31:34| Seriously, though charter questions, you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12694)|
| 3:31:37| Obviously, we're not voting to change the charter as I think councilman Ryder mentioned earlier, but maybe I'll ask for mr. Frost and mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12697)|
| 3:31:44| Swanson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12704)|
| 3:31:47| How should we think about when an ordinance we are passing does conflict with the Charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12707)|
| 3:31:56| Mr. Swanson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12716)|
| 3:31:58| Maybe unintentionally, how should we where should we look for guidance as to whether an ordinance is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12718)|
| 3:32:04| unintentionally conflicting with the Charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12724)|
| 3:32:06| well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12726)|

| 3:32:18| if there are questions about whether something violates the Charter or doesn't violate the Charter and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12738)|
| 3:32:24| The the code in section 2 the administrative code says that that's the law director's responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12744)|
| 3:32:30| And it is the law director's responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12750)|
| 3:32:34| But it's not just me who's looked at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12754)|
| 3:32:37| To determine that it does not in fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12757)|
| 3:32:40| conflict with our Charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12760)|

| 3:32:58| Independently to look at this to see if if there is some violation of the Charter with this. It's not there. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12778)|
| 3:33:08| Know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12788)|
| 3:33:11| Mr. King has been unhappy for some period of time with what happened in his particular case, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12791)|
| 3:33:21| Mr. Lyon at that point was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12801)|
| 3:33:23| Representing a client and doing what he was asked to do as a lawyer to represent a client| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12803)|

| 3:33:31| There's a saying out there. If you hadn't lost any cases you hadn't tried many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12811)|
| 3:33:36| And that's the case and they really don't have anything at all to do with it. I think the same applies to land-use ordinances by the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12816)|
| 3:33:42| Yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12822)|

| 3:33:58| this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12838)|

| 3:34:49| and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12889)|
| 3:34:50| the HR Department will notify the Civil Service Merit Board of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12890)|
| 3:34:56| Allegations of any persons on matters of discrimination in hiring transfer or promotion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12896)|

| 3:35:18| May be given prompt and proper attentions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12918)|
| 3:35:22| Coming down to section 14 says very specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12922)|
| 3:35:27| Nothing in this ordinance shall impair or diminish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12927)|
| 3:35:30| the rights benefits and privileges of city employees in the classified service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12930)|
| 3:35:36| To have the Civil Service Merit Board here allegations of discrimination in hiring transfer or promotion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12936)|
| 3:35:44| Neglect of duty or other violations of merit system principles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12944)|

| 3:36:02| For employment. Okay, all of that is very consistent with what our Charter says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12962)|
| 3:36:08| This is not a diminution of any civil service rights of any of our classified employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12968)|
| 3:36:14| so our time together is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12974)|
| 3:36:17| Expired but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12977)|
| 3:36:22| Mr. Swann, he was winding up all night. So he's ready to let go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12982)|
| 3:36:26| If the Civil Service Merit Board's council representative council disagrees with what you just said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12986)|
| 3:36:33| How should you how do you suggest this body think about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12993)|
| 3:36:37| Well, I think you have to decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=12997)|
| 3:36:40| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13000)|
| 3:36:43| Think you abide by the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13003)|
| 3:36:46| And the code says that the law director is the interpreter of the Charter. Okay. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13006)|
| 3:36:54| Thank you. Thank you. Mr. Swanson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13014)|
| 3:36:57| Next is the council member Fugate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13017)|
| 3:37:01| Thank you, I'm gonna get this new microphone down eventually a couple of points first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13021)|
| 3:37:08| I intend to support this ordinance. Just get that off the right off the bat as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13028)|
| 3:37:14| A person who manages people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13034)|
| 3:37:17| one stop shop for your employees about where to go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13037)|
| 3:37:22| To ask any questions that relate to their employment is an important thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13042)|
| 3:37:27| I worry that the current system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13047)|
| 3:37:30| We have now could actually lead to under reporting of incidences because people don't know where to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13050)|
| 3:37:36| the other reason I like this ordinance is I fully expect and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13056)|
| 3:37:41| Dr. Drummond said compel I'll ask nicely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13061)|
| 3:37:45| but I do think that this would be incumbent to have an annual report of where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13065)|
| 3:37:51| grievances and the complaints come from you can't fix anything if you're not keeping up with it and this hodgepodge patchwork of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13071)|
| 3:37:59| Complaints and record-keeping is also doing our employees a disservice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13079)|
| 3:38:04| So and we're also doing our managers a disservice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13084)|
| 3:38:08| If we don't know that we have issues that they need to be trained on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13088)|
| 3:38:12| So I think for all those reasons HR is the right place to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13092)|
| 3:38:17| also fully agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13097)|
| 3:38:20| with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13100)|
| 3:38:21| the if the if the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13101)|
| 3:38:24| If it says that the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13104)|
| 3:38:26| interprets the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13106)|
| 3:38:28| That's what we have to go by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13108)|
| 3:38:31| lawyers disagree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13111)|
| 3:38:33| The only people that really decide things are judges and that requires a lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13113)|
| 3:38:40| Short of the city suing itself about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13120)|
| 3:38:44| We should go with what the Charter said, which is the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13124)|
| 3:38:49| Interprets the Charter and there's nothing that I've heard that pre that takes away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13129)|
| 3:38:56| Legal rights that employees have so therefore I will support this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13136)|
| 3:39:04| Thank you, we'll go to councilmember Parker and then councilmember Ryder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13144)|
| 3:39:10| Thank You mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13150)|
| 3:39:14| I've gone through all of the text and I other than the law director and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13154)|
| 3:39:21| Mr. Frost saying it is their interpretation. I see no evidence that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13161)|
| 3:39:28| The mayor's office has such authority. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13168)|
| 3:39:31| See the Charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13171)|

| 3:39:54| It says clearly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13194)|
| 3:39:57| That under the Civil Service Merit Board in the Charter it is the duty of the Civil Service Merit Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13197)|
| 3:40:05| To develop a program to provide for equal employment opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13205)|
| 3:40:10| To all employees and applicants for employment with regard to all aspects of employment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13210)|
| 3:40:17| It also says they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13217)|
| 3:40:20| The authority to take all further and necessary action as it may determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13220)|

| 3:40:50| Continues on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13250)|
| 3:40:52| And then in the next section it says if there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13252)|
| 3:40:57| Any Senate City Administrator rule or Civil Service Merit Board rule or regulation inconsistent with this ordinance the latter shall prevail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13257)|
| 3:41:10| I'm worried about what precedent this sets. I'm worried about what message this sends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13270)|
| 3:41:16| To our employees about how much we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13276)|

| 3:41:58| The employee can sue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13318)|

| 3:43:16| So once you have those duties as a board you cannot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13396)|
| 3:43:20| Reassign them to someone else. Those are your duties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13400)|
| 3:43:28| And it's our job and our responsibility to respect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13408)|
| 3:43:31| That if we want to change it, we can't initiate a charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13411)|

| 3:45:16| we also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13516)|
| 3:45:18| Heard from the law director relative to his opinion on the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13518)|
| 3:45:21| I guess say speaking to the substance of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13521)|
| 3:45:25| The board think it's safe to say we did not take a vote because nothing came before us for a vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13525)|
| 3:45:30| But the clear consensus of the board was that the substantive changes were positive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13530)|
| 3:45:36| Positive for employees by giving them a clear path if they had a complaint to follow in that no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13536)|
| 3:45:43| Civil service protections were in any way removed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13543)|
| 3:45:46| So we saw employees as rights is only being enhanced with with no detriment whatsoever. That's on the substance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13546)|
| 3:45:53| We spent a good deal of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13553)|
| 3:45:56| hearing from the civil service attorney about concerns with the charter and I say that the their sentiment is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13556)|
| 3:46:04| That the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13564)|
| 3:46:07| Discussions of the charter are frankly above the pay grade of the board and I repeat what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13567)|
| 3:46:13| law director Swanson said that the person charged with interpreting the charter was the city law director and that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13573)|

| 3:46:27| So yes, we did spend significant time on the substance of the changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13587)|
| 3:46:32| No, no board member expressed any concerns about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13592)|

| 3:46:51| And mr. King, I'm gonna make a point of asking some questions. I feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13611)|
| 3:46:58| You you're cool with that you brought up that your past litigation and it was well-tossed about the newspapers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13618)|

| 3:47:08| Mr. King brought up the concern as you know the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13628)|
| 3:47:13| Example where he felt the need to litigate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13633)|
| 3:47:17| because he was treated unfairly or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13637)|
| 3:47:21| I'm not gonna get into the the gist of it, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13641)|
| 3:47:25| If that situation because his concern that he brought up was like for future employees that someone still retain those rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13645)|
| 3:47:32| If that situation happened again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13652)|

| 3:47:43| I believe the gist of that was he went and sought civil service protection because he had civil service rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13663)|
| 3:47:51| How would that work now if this changed this ordinance happened an employee would come to it would not change at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13671)|

| 3:48:05| What the situation that mr. King is talking about is a based on discipline based on a grievance process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13685)|
| 3:48:12| And none of that changes through civil service. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13692)|
| 3:48:18| HR is not involved in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13698)|
| 3:48:20| Mr. King's situation in the past. Well HR didn't exist and nor if that occurred today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13700)|
| 3:48:28| HR would not be involved in that that would still go to civil service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13708)|
| 3:48:31| It still will go through the grievance process and all of that would be through civil service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13711)|
| 3:48:37| Does not impact HR at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13717)|

| 3:52:57| Thank You mayor. I want to follow up on miss Cook's comments around the ADA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13977)|

| 3:53:09| Mr. Lyon Devin Lyon, could you speak to councilmember Smith's question about ADA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13989)|
| 3:53:16| Devin Lyon from Arnett Baker Draper and hey good. Thank you councilmembers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=13996)|
| 3:53:21| Yes, councilmember Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=14001)|
| 3:53:23| to be honest, I'm a little confused as to what the concerns were as articulated because what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=14003)|
| 3:53:29| Recommendations from this report that I have made that are incorporated into the ordinance that is before you tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=14009)|
| 3:53:36| Essentially when it comes to the ADA at this time do not change any of those elements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=14016)|
| 3:53:42| In fact what the ultimate recommendations of the report were relative to the ADA is that while the supervisor of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=14022)|
| 3:53:49| ADA coordinator may change by part by bringing this within the clearinghouse that will be the HR department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=14029)|
| 3:53:57| Administrative rule 15 that Miss Cook cited is actually intended to be the one-stop shop of the administrative rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=14037)|
| 3:54:03| Where the other administrative rules of the city that invoke additional detail and procedure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=14043)|
| 3:54:10| Relative to EEO compliance and protections will be pulled into administrative rule 15. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=14050)|
| 3:54:17| That's what I can speak to there are no proposed changes other than a recommendation that we tweak the reasonable accommodation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=14057)|
| 3:54:24| Committee that is rarely invoked, but there are no proposed changes to the grievance process under the ADA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=14064)|
| 3:54:30| There are no proposed changes to the reasonable accommodation process under the ADA. It's simply an organizational move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=14070)|
| 3:54:37| Okay, thank you, thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=14077)|
| 3:54:40| Councilmember Parker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=14080)|
| 3:54:42| You have a question question or comment. Can you clear an organizational move? Can you clarify what you mean by that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=14082)|
| 3:54:51| It's an organizational move in that those EEO functions are going to be part of the HR department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=14091)|
| 3:54:56| like I mentioned to councilmember Smith the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=14096)|

| 3:55:09| But the underlying functions thereof will not change in the least but that sounds like quite a change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=14109)|
| 3:55:15| Right when you move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=14115)|

| 3:55:24| There is no change proposed at this time for the ADA coordinator to have any of her functions altered in any way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=14124)|
| 3:55:31| it's simply taking a position that is confusingly and currently located in the housing the Department of Housing and Neighborhoods and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=14131)|
