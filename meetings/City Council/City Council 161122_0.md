| 0:04:27| KnoxvilleTN.gov slash Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=267)|
| 0:04:31| Now let's talk garbage and recycling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=271)|
| 0:04:34| Last month, council approved a new garbage and recycling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=274)|
| 0:04:37| contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=277)|
| 0:04:38| As you recall, part of that agreement was that the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=278)|
| 0:04:41| would purchase brand new garbage carts for all of our curbside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=281)|
| 0:04:44| collection customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=284)|
| 0:04:47| So I want to give everyone a heads up that those carts are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=287)|
| 0:04:49| here, about 60,000 carts, and our contractor, Waste| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=289)|
| 0:04:54| Connections, will be assembling all of those and they will begin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=294)|
| 0:04:57| delivering them to households across the city on December 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=297)|
| 0:05:02| The goal is to get them all delivered before Christmas and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=302)|
| 0:05:05| then all of us will use them in the first week of January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=305)|
| 0:05:11| The first batches are going to be delivered to South Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=311)|
| 0:05:14| and I can promise you I had nothing to do with setting the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=314)|
| 0:05:16| schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=316)|
| 0:05:17| I think it was Councilman Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=317)|
| 0:05:19| No, me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=319)|
| 0:05:20| I saw where that was going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=320)|
| 0:05:23| We had nothing to do with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=323)|
| 0:05:25| However, it will quickly follow to other areas of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=325)|
| 0:05:31| And there will be plenty of public notice and information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=331)|
| 0:05:34| about all of this over the next month, but we want everybody to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=334)|
| 0:05:37| be on the lookout for those carts at your home if you live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=337)|
| 0:05:40| in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=340)|
| 0:05:41| They will come with a tag explaining the program and how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=341)|
| 0:05:44| and when to use them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=344)|
| 0:05:46| And of course, if anyone has any questions about our waste| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=346)|
| 0:05:48| collection, just call 3-1-1, the city's phone number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=348)|

| 0:17:55| We asked when you step up to the podium, you give your name and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1075)|
| 0:17:57| address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1077)|

| 0:18:02| five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1082)|

| 0:18:14| I've spoken on this matter several times now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1094)|
| 0:18:17| And instead of rehashing my entire argument, I will focus on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1097)|
| 0:18:21| the two things that I think are the most important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1101)|
| 0:18:25| What I've seen from council members, from people who've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1105)|
| 0:18:29| spoken here from newspaper articles is that this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1109)|
| 0:18:33| was put in place to protect the church with all due respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1113)|
| 0:18:38| I would ask from what the businesses that this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1118)|
| 0:18:43| affects are not rowdy biker bars or seedy juke joints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1123)|
| 0:18:51| Hey, those things are mostly things of the past and B if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1131)|
| 0:18:55| those things want to come into existence today, they are all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1135)|
| 0:18:59| going to serve liquor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| They are all going to get that permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1141)|
| 0:19:03| They're all going to go that route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1143)|
| 0:19:05| The only businesses being affected by this are small craft| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1145)|
| 0:19:10| breweries, coffee shops who would like to maybe sell beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1150)|
| 0:19:13| in the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1153)|
| 0:19:14| In one instance, a church here was being protected from a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1154)|
| 0:19:18| bookstore that wanted to sell beer for its Friday night poetry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1158)|
| 0:19:21| readings, Asian restaurants that would like to serve bottles of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1161)|
| 0:19:27| beer with lunch or dinner, pizza places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1167)|
| 0:19:29| These are not rowdy, demonous, awful places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1169)|
| 0:19:33| This is part of normal life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1173)|
| 0:19:36| And there's nothing to me that is, that needs protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1176)|
| 0:19:43| The other point I would like to make is we have seen a huge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1183)|
| 0:19:49| huge downtown revitalization in Knoxville in the last five to 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1189)|
| 0:19:53| It's been fantastic and we all love it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1193)|
| 0:19:55| But the only downside of that is that downtown is now A, expensive and B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1195)|
| 0:20:01| full, there are very few vacancies downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1201)|
| 0:20:04| And for very, very good reason, this ordinance contains a stipulation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1204)|
| 0:20:10| that says in the downtown area, this 300 foot restriction does not apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1210)|
| 0:20:16| And that is for very good reason because it's a very tightly congested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1216)|
| 0:20:19| area with churches, with breweries, with bars, with all kinds of other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1219)|
| 0:20:25| Now, what we're starting to see in Knoxville is what we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1225)|
| 0:20:27| wanted to see for so very long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1227)|
| 0:20:31| I have opened a brewery in North Knoxville and along with that, there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1231)|
| 0:20:35| has been tons of other businesses, bakeries, coffee shops, restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1235)|
| 0:20:39| South Knoxville is exploding with Alliance Brewing Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1239)|
| 0:20:42| There is a potential for East Knoxville where Last Days of Autumn and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1242)|
| 0:20:46| Saltworks Brewing Company have moved to go the same route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1246)|
| 0:20:49| We want our neighborhoods to expand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1249)|
| 0:20:53| We want interesting things to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1253)|
| 0:20:56| We want tax revenue and we want our neighborhoods to improve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1256)|
| 0:21:00| This ordinance does nothing but hurt that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1260)|
| 0:21:04| It hurts churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1264)|
| 0:21:06| It hurts local businesses and anything that attacks economic growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1266)|
| 0:21:13| and the sense of community in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1273)|
| 0:21:16| The last thing I would like to mention is one of the things I love the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1276)|
| 0:21:19| about Knoxville is the sense of tight knit community I feel everywhere across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1279)|
| 0:21:24| the city, things that are very important to creating this fabric, our churches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1284)|

| 0:22:07| detrimental to the communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1327)|
| 0:22:09| It's detrimental to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1329)|
| 0:22:11| And I urge you to vote for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1331)|

| 0:22:25| Please state your name and address for the record, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1347)|
| 0:22:30| Thank you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1350)|
| 0:22:32| Hunter Wright, lead pastor of Ignition Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1352)|
| 0:22:34| My address, personal address is 310 West Jackson Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1354)|
| 0:22:37| Our church meets at the Knoxville Convention Center, which is 701 Henley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1357)|
| 0:22:40| Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1360)|
| 0:22:41| I am not here to speak about theology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1361)|
| 0:22:44| I don't think that's what the council was deciding upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1364)|
| 0:22:47| I am not here to even really speak about what I can't speak to because my church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1367)|
| 0:22:52| meets in downtown, so we're not affected by this waiver per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1372)|
| 0:22:57| I am here to simply speak about what a church, how a church operates without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1377)|
| 0:23:01| this waiver encroaching, because I know there is some fear about what would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1381)|
| 0:23:06| happen if this was waived outside of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1386)|
| 0:23:10| We have been meeting as a church in downtown for three years, three plus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1390)|
| 0:23:15| years, and again, we're not under this ordinance and we have never had any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1395)|
| 0:23:21| issues with what, what some people seem to be afraid of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1401)|
| 0:23:26| We've never had any interruption of our services, never had any interruption of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1406)|
| 0:23:31| our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1411)|
| 0:23:32| We've never had, we never had to be fearful for our safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1412)|
| 0:23:36| Our kids have never been feared for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1416)|
| 0:23:40| We are very well protected by our city and we feel very, very, very safe even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1420)|
| 0:23:47| without any legal protection over us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1427)|
| 0:23:51| And so we've been able to operate as a church just fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| And we certainly love everyone and are so excited about all the neighbors we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1434)|
| 0:24:00| have and would hate to see other churches not be able to have great neighbors and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| great tenants because of an old ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1445)|
| 0:24:08| So that's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1448)|
| 0:24:10| Thank you, council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1452)|
| 0:24:13| Now, Rodney Arnold, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1453)|
| 0:24:24| Rodney Arnold, lead pastor of One Life Church, 2900 Knoxville Center Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1464)|
| 0:24:33| Thank you for having me again, starting to get to know you all quite well through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1473)|
| 0:24:36| this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1476)|
| 0:24:37| And as I've said, each time that I've stood before you, the support that my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| church has for this ordinance and the now close to 15 churches representing nearly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1481)|
| 0:24:45| 30,000 people that attend those churches, the support that we have has nothing to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1485)|
| 0:24:49| with a biblical disagreement, a biblical interpretation or theological stance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1489)|
| 0:24:54| It has to do with one simple point that has not seemed to be able to cut through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1494)|
| 0:24:58| the rhetoric of fear that that has gotten the loudest voice through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1498)|
| 0:25:01| And that is this simple point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1501)|
| 0:25:03| The ordinance as it stands today does absolutely nothing to keep alcohol 300| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1503)|
| 0:25:09| feet away from churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1509)|
| 0:25:11| I think a lot of the folks that are in opposition to this ordinance change are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| under the false interpretation that beer cannot be sold within 300 feet of their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1513)|
| 0:25:18| church right now, or that a bar could not move in across the street or next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1518)|
| 0:25:22| And as you know, but I want to be on the record for media and those here to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1522)|
| 0:25:25| know is that is not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| This ordinance does not stop that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| It does not curb alcohol abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1528)|
| 0:25:31| And there will be some great arguments made after me by some great men of God| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1531)|
| 0:25:34| from some other churches, then they won't be wrong in a lot of ways, but this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1534)|
| 0:25:38| ordinance will make their points moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1538)|
| 0:25:41| Because the opportunity here is to look at this and see what is it truly doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1541)|
| 0:25:46| as the ordinance stands now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| That's because this ordinance does not apply to the vast majority of alcohol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1547)|
| 0:25:50| sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1550)|
| 0:25:51| This ordinance does not stop beer from being sold at Weigel's 20 feet from my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1555)|
| 0:25:56| This beer, this, this ordinance does not stop alcohol from being sold right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1556)|
| 0:26:01| across the street from our church at a Mexican restaurant or at a bar because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1561)|
| 0:26:04| those places are regulated by the state and not the city and the state has no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1564)|
| 0:26:09| distance requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1569)|
| 0:26:10| So that means right now, any church in this city could have a bar, the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1570)|
| 0:26:13| hell raising raucous bar you can imagine could move in right next door to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1573)|
| 0:26:17| church or across the street as the law stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1577)|
| 0:26:20| So this ordinance that we're discussing tonight, it does nothing to protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1583)|
| 0:26:24| It does nothing to prevent alcohol sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| It does nothing to curb alcohol abuse and does everything to hurt churches like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1586)|
| 0:26:31| ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1591)|
| 0:26:32| Our church four times in the last seven years, either through our own efforts of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1592)|
| 0:26:35| growth or through church planting has had this ordinance nearly prevent us from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1595)|
| 0:26:38| acquiring a facility, both in leasing facilities and in purchasing facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1598)|
| 0:26:43| because landlords and developers look at churches and see if you're in my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| development, then it's going to make it that much harder for me to attract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1606)|
| 0:26:49| business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1609)|
| 0:26:50| And I'd rather you just not be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1610)|
| 0:26:52| We've had that four times in seven years, making it that much harder for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1612)|
| 0:26:55| gospel to advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1615)|
| 0:26:57| Some would say, well, okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1617)|
| 0:26:58| So this ordinance stops those, those places like Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| McClain's that sell only beer is would stop the bowling alley would stop a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1620)|
| 0:27:03| Chuck E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1623)|
| 0:27:04| Cheese.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1624)|
| 0:27:04| It would stop that type of deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1624)|
| 0:27:07| Let's just do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1627)|
| 0:27:08| Well, the problem is it doesn't even stop that because then, as you all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1628)|
| 0:27:11| those places simply apply for the state liquor license and they're allowed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1631)|
| 0:27:14| sell beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1634)|
| 0:27:16| So this, this ordinance does nothing except one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1636)|
| 0:27:19| It hurts churches like ours and others that are growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1639)|
| 0:27:22| So some would say, and some have said that, well, that's just because you're a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1642)|
| 0:27:25| new church and that's not our problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1645)|
| 0:27:27| We can't cater to new churches, but that's simply not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| Sevier Heights Baptist church, one of the oldest churches in our city meets part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1650)|
| 0:27:34| of their church in an old shopping center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1654)|
| 0:27:35| Grace Baptist church celebrates 100 years this year and has part of their church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1655)|
| 0:27:39| in an old food line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1659)|
| 0:27:40| Cokesbury United Methodist church has portions of their church in a Lowe's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1660)|
| 0:27:44| building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1664)|
| 0:27:44| Even Antioch Baptist church, my brother will speak in just a few moments, got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1664)|
| 0:27:48| their start in 1972, not that long ago compared to the others I've just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| mentioned in the lobby of a bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1671)|
| 0:27:54| This is not an issue that only applies to new churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1674)|
| 0:27:57| So then some would say, well, it's been on the books this long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1677)|
| 0:27:59| Why, why change the ordinance now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| And we all know that's just not how our society functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1681)|
| 0:28:04| If that was the case, then women would still not be voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1684)|
| 0:28:08| Slavery would still be legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1688)|
| 0:28:11| Well, I guess it's been on the books for so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1691)|
| 0:28:14| I say how our churches function because we have these fun things called business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1694)|
| 0:28:17| meetings where we like to vote and argue about changing things because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1697)|
| 0:28:21| things need to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1701)|
| 0:28:23| So now I'll take the last minute and I will dive into a theological stance since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1703)|
| 0:28:27| I haven't done so to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| It's been said that this ordinance change caters only to the few and not the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1708)|
| 0:28:31| majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1711)|
| 0:28:33| While that's simply not true, the majority does seem to favor this change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| because it does nothing to protect churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1716)|
| 0:28:39| I seem to think about Jesus talking about leaving the 99, which was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1719)|
| 0:28:42| majority, to take care of the need of one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1722)|
| 0:28:46| It's been said that dues need to be paid by us new young whippersnappers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1726)|
| 0:28:49| leading these churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1729)|
| 0:28:50| And apparently before a concern is valid or a seat at the adult table was made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1730)|
| 0:28:54| available, we need to pay some dues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| But Jesus seems to teach that he paid the only dues that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1737)|
| 0:29:00| As the old song says, Jesus paid it all, all to him I owe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1740)|
| 0:29:04| And that puts me on equal footing before the cross and before the father.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1744)|
| 0:29:09| Finally, I began to think about other things Jesus taught, that the new wine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1749)|
| 0:29:12| can't fit in old wine skins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| Ironic that he chose wine to teach that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1754)|
| 0:29:17| The gospel of Luke tells us that Jesus was called a glutton and a drunkard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1757)|
| 0:29:21| There's only one reason someone would be called a drunkard and a friend of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1761)|
| 0:29:24| sinners, because they didn't put a barrier between them and those who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1764)|
| 0:29:27| were different than them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1767)|
| 0:29:29| And with that in mind, I just want to encourage the council to continue to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1769)|
| 0:29:32| support this as you did four weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| And I would ask the church to remember what Jesus said, that they will know us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1774)|
| 0:29:38| by our love and as council votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| I hope that's what our city sees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1780)|
| 0:29:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1781)|
| 0:29:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1782)|
| 0:29:43| Now, Reverend Stauffer, did you want to, did you all choose your three speakers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1783)|
| 0:29:55| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1796)|
| 0:29:56| We'll start with Charles Jenkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1796)|
| 0:30:01| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1801)|
| 0:30:01| Jenkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1801)|
| 0:30:02| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1802)|
| 0:30:15| But your name and address for the record, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| And I'll set the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1817)|
| 0:30:19| One 11 East Columbia Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1819)|
| 0:30:22| I'm the senior pastor at Oakwood Baptist church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1822)|
| 0:30:26| Our church was founded in 1903.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1826)|
| 0:30:29| Something that hasn't been mentioned tonight that I would like to mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1829)|
| 0:30:33| our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and teachers and parents and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1833)|
| 0:30:39| those first responders in Chattanooga to those children that had been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1839)|
| 0:30:45| killed in a tragic bus accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1845)|
| 0:30:49| Our church is part of the Knox County Baptist association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1849)|
| 0:30:53| And we are a network of 150 churches in the Knoxville association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1853)|
| 0:31:00| Most of our churches are having Thanksgiving services tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1860)|
| 0:31:04| So as not to have it tomorrow night, cause a lot of the ladies are cooking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1864)|
| 0:31:08| and getting ready and families are coming in for Thanksgiving and no doubt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1868)|
| 0:31:12| Some of your families are probably coming in as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1872)|
| 0:31:16| I'd like to thank the city council for your work in furthering and enhancing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1876)|
| 0:31:21| our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| But as I listened to the arguments and opinions, I was disappointed that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1883)|
| 0:31:29| didn't address something that we should all be concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1889)|
| 0:31:34| I don't really believe we should be concerned about the congruency of state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1894)|
| 0:31:39| and city statues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1899)|
| 0:31:40| Not when there's something far greater at stake, I don't think we should be so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1900)|
| 0:31:46| concerned about the difficulty that a business has in obtaining a permit to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1906)|
| 0:31:52| sell beer or alcohol when there's something far greater at stake, I realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1912)|
| 0:31:59| that it's not necessarily an issue of theology, although that is debated and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1919)|
| 0:32:03| interpreted differently between a few church bodies, ladies and gentlemen, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1923)|
| 0:32:09| submitted to you that it is all about the safety of our children and citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1929)|
| 0:32:15| and the health of our children and citizens of this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1935)|
| 0:32:20| Some of our churches have daycare centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1940)|
| 0:32:23| Some of our churches have sports activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1943)|
| 0:32:27| Some of our churches have Christian schools housed in the facilities after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1947)|
| 0:32:32| school programs and every Sunday and other days in the week, our churches are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1952)|
| 0:32:37| filled with children and families and the elderly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1957)|
| 0:32:41| We have elderly senior citizens who cross the streets to and from our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1961)|
| 0:32:46| churches, so we are concerned about safety, but not only safety, but the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1966)|
| 0:32:51| health of our citizens, every single one of us are fully aware of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1971)|
| 0:32:57| destructiveness and the addictive nature of alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1977)|
| 0:33:01| We see our citizens slaughtered almost every week on the roadways from impaired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1981)|
| 0:33:08| drivers, drivers who sometimes come out of these establishments, but after buying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1988)|
| 0:33:17| and drinking, consuming alcohol, because these establishments have been given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=1997)|
| 0:33:22| permits to be able to do so, we should make it harder, not easier to obtain a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2002)|
| 0:33:29| permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2009)|
| 0:33:30| Ladies and gentlemen, we know that alcohol is just like any other drug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2010)|
| 0:33:34| It's just as addictive as heroin or methamphetamines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2014)|
| 0:33:38| We see the many men and women who are homeless on our streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2018)|
| 0:33:43| Some have mental health issues, but the vast majority have addiction issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2023)|
| 0:33:50| They're addicted to drugs and alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2030)|
| 0:33:53| How much money do we spend there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2033)|
| 0:33:56| There's ministries all over the city devoted just to that purpose, to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2036)|
| 0:34:00| people with drug and alcohol addictions, even rehab centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2040)|
| 0:34:05| I mean, take, for instance, Cornerstone out off Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2045)|
| 0:34:09| It continues to grow and expand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2051)|
| 0:34:12| Because the problem continues to grow and expand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2052)|
| 0:34:16| It's dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| It's a drug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| You have one minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2061)|
| 0:34:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2062)|
| 0:34:23| It destroys marriages and families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2063)|
| 0:34:25| And often where there is abuse in the home, there is alcohol in the home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2065)|
| 0:34:31| According to the CDC November report of 2015, the annual national cost related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2071)|
| 0:34:37| to alcohol is $249 billion per state, $3.5 billion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2077)|
| 0:34:44| That cost reflects loss in workplace productivity, criminal justice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2084)|
| 0:34:50| expenses, motor vehicle crashes, healthcare expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2090)|
| 0:34:54| Ladies and gentlemen, I call upon your wisdom and compassion and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2094)|
| 0:34:59| concern for the safety and health of our children who are in these facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2099)|
| 0:35:06| And the citizens of this city, I call upon you to vote no to lifting this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2106)|
| 0:35:11| ordinance has been in effect and safeguarding our churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2111)|
| 0:35:16| We are here now in Thanksgiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2116)|
| 0:35:20| And there's a great tragedy that has happened in Chattanooga| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| that's still under investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2124)|
| 0:35:25| Here at Christmas and new years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2125)|
| 0:35:28| And you can make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2128)|
| 0:35:30| You can take a step in safeguarding children and families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2130)|
| 0:35:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2136)|
| 0:35:46| Dale Chapman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2146)|
| 0:35:49| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2149)|
| 0:35:50| For being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2150)|
| 0:35:50| I am pastor Dale Chapman, Hinton street, Bible Methodist church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2150)|
| 0:35:59| It's located at 207 Hinton Avenue near the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2159)|
| 0:36:07| I've watched the press closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2167)|
| 0:36:10| I have tried to contact each of you yesterday and the day before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2170)|
| 0:36:15| I received very gracious responses for most or no response at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2175)|
| 0:36:22| But I think that it is evident that there are several things happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2182)|
| 0:36:27| that have not been addressed by the arguments that have been made today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2187)|
| 0:36:34| Some of them were emotional arguments rather than arguments based on legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2194)|
| 0:36:40| decisions, or even the information that is readily available on the internet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2200)|
| 0:36:45| from the centers for disease control, the department of justice and other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2205)|
| 0:36:51| But let me start with my own thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2211)|
| 0:36:56| Alcohol has touched my life as a pastor and as a person, not because I have ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2216)|
| 0:37:03| tasted it, but because family members, close friends and parishioners have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2223)|
| 0:37:12| had their lives devastated by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2232)|
| 0:37:17| It has been stated that this is needed for churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2237)|
| 0:37:22| And yet, according to the press, all of those issues have been resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2242)|
| 0:37:28| It has been stated that this is a wonderful addition to the finances of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2248)|
| 0:37:33| our community, and yet, as the previous speaker noted, it costs $249| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2253)|
| 0:37:41| billion a year to our society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2261)|
| 0:37:46| I would say that things other than alcohol have helped to revitalize our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2266)|
| 0:37:50| city that amounts to over $2 per drink in costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2270)|
| 0:37:56| Over $800 for each one of us here every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2276)|
| 0:38:00| Those are hidden costs that are not being figured in this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2280)|
| 0:38:06| The third item that concerns me is we have been told that this can't be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2286)|
| 0:38:10| enforced, can't hold up under law, isn't really even necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2290)|
| 0:38:17| Why try to enforce it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2297)|
| 0:38:18| And yet, you all are leaving a half dozen other institutions in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2298)|
| 0:38:26| Churches have those very same activities in their locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2306)|
| 0:38:32| And I'm asking you to take a mind's journey with me for just a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2312)|
| 0:38:41| I'll try to go in about 30 seconds to the home of a lady who has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2321)|
| 0:38:47| a lady who's tried to raise her family, but her husband has been abusive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2327)|
| 0:38:53| and an alcoholic for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2333)|
| 0:38:57| It's not because he stays home and drinks, but because there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2337)|
| 0:39:01| so many places in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| I walked in this evening and you were approving a whole stream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2343)|
| 0:39:07| of further alcohol permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2347)|
| 0:39:10| There is no shortage of alcohol in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2350)|
| 0:39:15| If you would go to the Centers for Disease Control website and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2355)|
| 0:39:19| Department of Justice community policing websites, you would find that while the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2359)|
| 0:39:25| distance rule by itself does not protect people from alcohol, it acts as an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2365)|
| 0:39:31| important tool that the city of Knoxville has among six or eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2371)|
| 0:39:35| In fact, some reports by the Pacific Institution list it first as a tool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2375)|
| 0:39:42| that you have to act as a sieve to keep these institutions from concentrating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2382)|
| 0:39:47| and thereby causing both crime and disruption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2387)|
| 0:39:54| Our little church remembers the days between prohibition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2394)|
| 0:39:59| You have one minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2399)|
| 0:40:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2400)|
| 0:40:01| And this ordinance, our services were disrupted by alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2401)|
| 0:40:07| And I'm pleading with you to take the measured approach of your colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2407)|
| 0:40:12| that have already suggested a different path that addresses all of the concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2412)|
| 0:40:17| that you've raised and yet continues to protect churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2417)|
| 0:40:22| Finally, even if there's no way to enforce this, you would be showing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2422)|
| 0:40:27| your respect for a partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2427)|
| 0:40:30| I view myself as someone who's trying to help and I'm not trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2430)|
| 0:40:36| help in my capacity for law and order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2436)|
| 0:40:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2440)|
| 0:40:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2441)|
| 0:40:49| Pastor Doug Stauffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2449)|
| 0:40:51| My name is Doug Stauffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2451)|
| 0:40:52| I thank you, Mayor Rojero and city council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2452)|
| 0:40:58| I'm from Antioch Baptist church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2458)|
| 0:41:01| What's your address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2461)|
| 0:41:03| Oh, at 5709 North Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2463)|
| 0:41:06| I'm a retired CPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2466)|
| 0:41:07| I've managed several multimillion dollar companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2467)|
| 0:41:11| I'm very pro business, so I understand the business aspects inside of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2471)|
| 0:41:16| Yet my first and greatest concern is how I represent Jesus Christ and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2476)|
| 0:41:21| Christianity to a world with a desperate need of knowing the truth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2481)|
| 0:41:25| and accepting Christ as savior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| Concerning the beer ordinance, we have found overwhelming support for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2488)|
| 0:41:31| council to vote no concerning the proposed change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2491)|
| 0:41:35| We have direct contact with 37 churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2495)|
| 0:41:38| That means direct, not indirect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2498)|
| 0:41:39| We've talked to that many pastors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2499)|
| 0:41:43| If this is such a bad ordinance, then why is this same type of ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2503)|
| 0:41:47| established in most every city of the state and the United States?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2507)|
| 0:41:51| I mentioned some here in Tennessee, but even New York city, not known as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2511)|
| 0:41:56| bastion for this conservative values, has such protections in places for churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2516)|
| 0:42:04| I believe a three fold reason exists for the establishment of this ordinance in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2524)|
| 0:42:08| the majority of cities across the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2528)|
| 0:42:11| Number one, the institution of government historically displayed the utmost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2531)|
| 0:42:16| respect for religious institutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2536)|
| 0:42:19| Number two, common sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2539)|
| 0:42:22| Alcohol and those most vulnerable create a volatile mixture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2542)|
| 0:42:25| Number three, a concept of better safe than sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2545)|
| 0:42:30| All we are asking from this council is a little respect, some common| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2550)|
| 0:42:35| sense, and giving the safety of our children first priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2555)|
| 0:42:42| Our church is located in a commercial area, remains all inclusive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2562)|
| 0:42:46| We accept with open arms those who have any need of any type, but this does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2566)|
| 0:42:51| mean that every, uh, that we offer everyone unfettered access to our most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2571)|
| 0:42:57| vulnerable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2577)|
| 0:42:58| We simply want statutory provisions in place that act as a first line of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2578)|
| 0:43:02| defense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2582)|
| 0:43:03| This ordinance means that it is less likely for someone drinking next door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2583)|
| 0:43:07| leaving that place of business with impaired mental faculties, causing harm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2587)|
| 0:43:12| to our children or even the elderly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2592)|
| 0:43:16| Those not wanting to go through the difficult and expensive process of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2596)|
| 0:43:20| getting a liquor license might find it easier, cheaper, or less of a headache to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2600)|
| 0:43:24| simply locate outside the church's buffer zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2604)|
| 0:43:28| That means that the beer ordinance works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2608)|
| 0:43:32| It is a first line of defense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2612)|
| 0:43:34| It's a deterrent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| It is an imperfect defense, but it's a disincentive from locating next to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2616)|
| 0:43:42| churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2622)|
| 0:43:43| Claiming that it has no effect because it does not stop every instance is like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2623)|
| 0:43:47| saying stop signs and traffic lights don't work because some people run them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2627)|
| 0:43:53| Or an establishment should not ask for youth for ID because they could simply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2633)|
| 0:43:57| go down the street and find some establishment to sell alcohol without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2637)|
| 0:44:02| checking proof of age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| This beer ordinance is not an all or none type of ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2644)|
| 0:44:08| It doesn't stop at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2648)|
| 0:44:09| We're not asking that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| We know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2651)|
| 0:44:12| Everyone in here understands this is a beer ordinance, not an alcohol license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2652)|
| 0:44:17| from the state that can be had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| We're just asking you to be that first line of defense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2659)|
| 0:44:23| It's limited scope, but it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2663)|
| 0:44:26| If this was simply a matter of spreading the gospel, we would support the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2666)|
| 0:44:29| ordinance change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| But for us, it goes far beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| One to one of biblical standards and values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2673)|
| 0:44:37| This all started when First Lutheran Church and school in St.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2677)|
| 0:44:41| George Greek Orthodox Church, two churches were granted special event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2681)|
| 0:44:46| permits to serve alcohol in church grounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2686)|
| 0:44:49| As many of the city council members mentioned, we also find this situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2689)|
| 0:44:53| both hypocritical and we find it deplorable for churches doing this type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2693)|
| 0:44:58| of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2698)|
| 0:44:59| The scripture says Habakkuk 215, woe unto him that giveth his neighbor drink| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2699)|
| 0:45:05| that puteth the bottle to him and maketh him drunken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2705)|
| 0:45:08| Also, there is no excuse for a church being in the business of beer and alcohol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2708)|
| 0:45:13| sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2713)|
| 0:45:14| Even Pastor Arnold from One Life Church said at the October 25th meeting that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2714)|
| 0:45:21| some of the 14 churches he represents have a keg of beer at their next event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2721)|
| 0:45:25| may have it at their event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| The audio picked up snickering from some of the audience or the city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2727)|
| 0:45:31| members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2731)|
| 0:45:32| People scoffed at this because this is not the norm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2732)|
| 0:45:35| This is not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2735)|
| 0:45:37| This is not what we stand for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| What we're asking you to do as the city council is vote this thing down because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2739)|
| 0:45:44| it's the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2744)|
| 0:45:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2745)|
| 0:46:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2763)|
| 0:46:04| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2766)|
| 0:46:08| I hadn't intended to speak tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2768)|
| 0:46:11| I've made my feelings known, I think, the first time that we dealt with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2771)|
| 0:46:16| But I am going to quickly rehash the way I feel about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2776)|
| 0:46:22| I think this is an ordinance of change that has unintended consequences lasting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2782)|
| 0:46:28| for a long, long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| This is a good ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2790)|
| 0:46:31| It's been on the books for years and it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| There's no reason to change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2793)|
| 0:46:34| And I stood right there on this floor and put my hand on a Bible and said I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2794)|
| 0:46:41| would uphold the ordinances in the charter of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2801)|
| 0:46:46| What they do at the state, I have no no way to change what they do down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2806)|
| 0:46:52| But I do have the opportunity to protect and to uphold ordinances for the city of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2812)|
| 0:46:58| Knoxville as a city council person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| And I intend to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| And I talked about, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2823)|
| 0:47:08| Consequences to me could be we we did approve a lot of beer ordinances and not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2828)|
| 0:47:15| one gentleman, I asked him specifically about a patio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2835)|
| 0:47:18| And I said this the first time I spoke that an unintended consequence of this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2838)|
| 0:47:23| that during the closing communion or a message or the closing prayer and you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2843)|
| 0:47:32| got people gathering on these patios that are there for the football games and for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2852)|
| 0:47:36| the races and they're all fun events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2856)|
| 0:47:38| They're great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2858)|
| 0:47:39| There's nothing wrong with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| And they might be starting up 50 motorcycles to do a benefit motorcycle ride.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2861)|
| 0:47:47| And that's disruptive to a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2867)|
| 0:47:48| And if it's right next door, then it's even going to be way more disruptive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2868)|
| 0:47:55| As I heard tonight, and we all know churches have daycares, schools, all type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2875)|
| 0:48:01| of sports activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2881)|
| 0:48:02| It's more than just the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| When I grew up, you went, you know, on Sunday morning to Sunday school and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2884)|
| 0:48:09| you went to church and you know, we didn't have a whole lot of other activities, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2889)|
| 0:48:13| churches have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2893)|
| 0:48:14| And I understand churches have changed in the way that the some other people have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2894)|
| 0:48:19| worship in shopping centers and what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2899)|
| 0:48:21| But I just haven't heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2901)|
| 0:48:23| I felt this groundswell of support for this change through churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2903)|
| 0:48:28| And there may be a temporary problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2908)|
| 0:48:31| I'm finding a place, but I just haven't seen, it's not that I look at this all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2911)|
| 0:48:36| time, but there's, you know, I'll drive up and down the roads in the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2916)|
| 0:48:41| and I see a lot of vacant businesses and buildings that could be utilized for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2921)|
| 0:48:46| churches and a lot of other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2926)|
| 0:48:47| So I understand what the pastor saying about that, but I haven't seen the effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2927)|
| 0:48:54| of that and then it's been that big of an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2934)|
| 0:48:56| And I certainly haven't heard from anybody up until this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2936)|
| 0:49:02| Churches are a sanctuary of safety and prayer and they should be left that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2942)|
| 0:49:09| And I don't, I'm just not going to support the change in the ordinance and I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2949)|
| 0:49:12| shut up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2952)|
| 0:49:13| So I have to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2953)|
| 0:49:19| yeah, thank you, mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2959)|
| 0:49:20| And I have spoken to this issue before and again, I won't belabor it, but I think, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2960)|
| 0:49:26| think it's important for us to, to, to recognize that issue, that we have a place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2966)|
| 0:49:32| where there are children, where there are classes, where there are sports, where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2972)|
| 0:49:37| there are activities, and 300 feet is not a great distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2977)|
| 0:49:41| I mean, in my neighborhood, that's two yards, the front of two yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2981)|
| 0:49:46| And what we're trying to do by these, this ordinance that also protects schools and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2986)|
| 0:49:52| hospitals and other places is, is just keep some separation from an area that has a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2992)|
| 0:49:58| more, for lack of a better term, sanctified activity, an activity that should be free| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=2998)|
| 0:50:03| from intrusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3003)|
| 0:50:05| And Nick mentioned some of the kinds of intrusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3005)|
| 0:50:09| I'm opposed to, to the ordinance completely, but even if this body wants to act on it, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3009)|
| 0:50:17| say that the proposal in front of us is not narrow enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3017)|
| 0:50:22| I mean, when you, when you attack something fundamental, your obligation as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3022)|
| 0:50:27| legislature is to have a narrowly focused point of view that deals with the issue and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3027)|
| 0:50:34| is not overbroad and overlapping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3034)|
| 0:50:37| And this came to us as a way to resolve difficulty of storefront churches getting in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3037)|
| 0:50:44| strip malls or shopping malls or commercial areas where there was potentially some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3044)|
| 0:50:50| hindrance between renting to them and also a business that might choose to serve beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3050)|
| 0:50:57| And if we're going to attack anything at all or address, maybe attacks the wrong word, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3057)|
| 0:51:02| should be that problem and not simply to throw out all protection for churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3062)|
| 0:51:07| And so, again, I prefer to vote against it, but if we're going to take this up and move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3067)|
| 0:51:14| this forward, then we should simply add a proviso, and that's a lawyer word, but a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3074)|
| 0:51:19| proviso at the end of the sentence that limits, that basically says that the 300 foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3079)|
| 0:51:25| restriction on church buildings is way for storefront churches located in commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3085)|
| 0:51:30| malls, strip malls, or other commercial buildings in a commercial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3090)|
| 0:51:35| There's no reason to change the rule broader than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3095)|
| 0:51:38| That's the only harm, so-called harm, that we heard about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3098)|
| 0:51:42| So, one, I would urge you not to vote in favor of the change, but two, if we are, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3102)|
| 0:51:49| let's narrowly tailor it to the specific problem that has been raised and brought before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3109)|
| 0:51:55| us. How do we have two things coexist in a way that is not harmful?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3115)|
| 0:52:00| I think when you think about a storefront church, it doesn't have schoolyards and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3120)|
| 0:52:05| playgrounds and all those things that maybe more traditional churches have, and those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3125)|
| 0:52:10| places have certainly greater need for protection, and I think that we shouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3130)|
| 0:52:16| undermine that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3136)|
| 0:52:17| It's no different, in my mind, than the daycare or the hospital or the other places of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3137)|
| 0:52:21| great importance to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3141)|
| 0:52:23| So, I'd like to vote against it, but if not, I will make an amendment proposal with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3143)|
| 0:52:28| proviso that limits it solely to that storefront usage in commercial areas, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3148)|
| 0:52:34| that's the only so-called evil that we're asked to address as a legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3154)|
| 0:52:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| Councilman Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3162)|
| 0:52:43| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3163)|
| 0:52:44| This certainly sort of feels like a big vote, but I remind myself it's really not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3164)|
| 0:52:51| It's not a big change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3171)|
| 0:52:55| There is, and I think Pastor Arnold said this, there really is no 300-foot distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3175)|
| 0:53:00| requirement. If you read articles on it, it always makes it seem like there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3180)|
| 0:53:07| There's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3187)|
| 0:53:08| Obviously, if you're not close to a church, you can get a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3188)|
| 0:53:13| If you're close to a church, then the process is a little more cumbersome, but it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3193)|
| 0:53:18| still there. So, in effect, if you want to sell beer next to a church, you just have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3198)|
| 0:53:23| get a liquor permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3203)|
| 0:53:24| That's the way it's been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| And there's been a lot of talk today about churches, but I've sat on the beer board for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3206)|
| 0:53:34| five years, and I mean, I've never, a lot of times this comes up and I never hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3214)|
| 0:53:38| anyone say, you know, this is a special place, we'd rather you not do it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3218)|
| 0:53:42| I mean, most of the time someone says, if you want to do this, then you have to get a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3222)|
| 0:53:48| liquor permit. So to me, it's a matter of logic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3228)|
| 0:53:52| Can anyone say it makes sense that you can sell liquor and beer right next to a church?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3232)|
| 0:53:58| But if you want to sell just beer, you have to be 300 feet away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3238)|
| 0:54:02| I just cannot get past that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3242)|
| 0:54:06| This is so illogical to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3246)|
| 0:54:08| I think we have a duty to make our ordinances have some logic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3248)|
| 0:54:14| And so I think that's why it makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3254)|
| 0:54:15| It's not something I'm passionate about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3255)|
| 0:54:18| And if the state law was different, I don't think we'd be here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3258)|
| 0:54:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3262)|
| 0:54:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3262)|
| 0:54:26| Councilman Del Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3266)|
| 0:54:27| I'd simply like to say that if we have a problem with the state law, then maybe we need a resolution urging them to change the state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3267)|
| 0:54:36| We're here in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3276)|
| 0:54:38| And, you know, I fully believe that our churches do a lot of good to make our communities cohesive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3278)|
| 0:54:48| They provide a communal service and process, a place to get together, a place to sort of confront our own conscience and our own activity and to learn how to be better people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3288)|
| 0:55:01| And I, for one, don't want to see us erode that in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3301)|
| 0:55:04| I think that's what makes living in the Bible Belt a treat and a pleasure and a great opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3304)|
| 0:55:12| We have to have a communal sense of ethics and morality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3312)|
| 0:55:16| And churches provide that, so why not give them a little buffer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3316)|
| 0:55:20| As to Councilman Starr's point of view or Pastor Arnold's, the fact that a convenience mart can sell a six-pack that you can't drink on the premises and you take away in your car and go drink somewhere else does not put the same situation as a bar or a place of business that might have someone hang out for several hours and probably drink a little too much and probably lose their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3320)|
| 0:55:46| inhibitions on how to act in public and whether it's noise or whether it's maybe improper activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3346)|
| 0:55:54| But I don't see any reason not to keep a buffer that protects places we hold dear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3354)|
| 0:56:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3360)|
| 0:56:07| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3367)|
| 0:56:10| So we have a motion and a second to approve the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3370)|
| 0:56:14| We'll do a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3374)|
| 0:56:15| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3375)|

| 0:56:30| Councilman Starr?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3390)|

| 0:56:32| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3392)|
| 0:56:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3393)|
| 0:56:34| The motion passes five to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3394)|
| 0:56:37| On to our next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3397)|
| 0:56:39| Councilman De La Voppe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3399)|
| 0:56:40| I would like to make a motion to reconsider to add an amendment to the statute at this time to reconsider our vote and to add an amendment to the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3400)|
| 0:56:51| The motion is out of order because you're not on the prevailing side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3411)|
| 0:56:54| Motion to reconsider has to be made by someone who voted on the prevailing side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3414)|
| 0:57:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3420)|
| 0:57:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3425)|
| 0:57:05| Bring it up in another hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3425)|
| 0:57:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3427)|
| 0:57:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3427)|
| 0:57:08| We'll move on to 9B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3428)|
| 0:57:10| 9B is an ordinance to amend Chapter 2, Article 3, Division 2, Section 2-450 of the Knoxville City Code to adjust the city of Knoxville's classification and compensation plans for general government employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3430)|
| 0:57:21| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3441)|
| 0:57:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3442)|
| 0:57:23| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3445)|

| 0:58:10| 11B is a resolution proposing to annex certain territory adjoining the bounds of the city of Knoxville, an area generally being described as a certain tract of land situated in the 6th Civil District of Knox County, Tennessee, fronting along the northern right-of-way line of Sherrill Boulevard west of its intersection with Park 40 North Boulevard and Christian Academy Boulevard, which property is to be incorporated into the limits of the city of Knoxville and to revise the boundary of Ward 47 of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3490)|
| 0:58:41| So as to include said area and to approve the plan of services for said area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3521)|
| 0:58:45| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3525)|
| 0:58:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3526)|
| 0:58:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3526)|
| 0:58:47| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3527)|
| 0:58:49| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3529)|
| 0:58:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3530)|
| 0:58:50| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3530)|
| 0:58:51| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3531)|
| 0:58:53| And we have a statement here from the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3533)|
| 0:58:56| I need to interrupt you just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| Just to let you know, you just annexed by a resolution which you've never done before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3538)|
| 0:59:02| You've always annexed by an ordinance before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3542)|
| 0:59:05| There's been a change by the state legislature in our state law that requires these annexations by request by the owner to be accomplished by resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3545)|
| 0:59:17| But it's a resolution that has to be read two times, which is totally inconsistent with our charter and our way that we do things and frankly inconsistent with the way most municipalities do things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3557)|
| 0:59:28| But that's very precisely what the state law requires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3568)|
| 0:59:32| And in order to comply with the state law, you're going to pass this resolution this time and have an opportunity to vote on it again at our next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3572)|
| 0:59:40| That's why it's coming back up in case you see it on the agenda and you wonder, didn't we just do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3580)|
| 0:59:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3586)|
| 0:59:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3586)|
| 0:59:48| Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3588)|
| 0:59:49| 11C is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute a lease agreement with Lincoln Memorial University for real property located at 601 West Summit Hill Drive, known as the Old City Hall Complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3589)|
| 1:00:00| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3600)|
| 1:00:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3601)|
| 1:00:02| Councilman Dela Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3602)|
| 1:00:02| Yeah, I wonder if someone can explain this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3602)|
| 1:00:04| I don't have a problem with the idea of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| It's just they seem to have the property tied up till 2032.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3606)|
| 1:00:11| Why are we extending the lease now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3611)|
| 1:00:13| What what does it achieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3613)|
| 1:00:14| I guess they do have it tied up until 2032 with a different primary less lessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3614)|
| 1:00:23| This will take out that primary lessee and substitute LMU as a primary lessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3623)|
| 1:00:27| And then the legal aid of East Twin Cities will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3627)|
| 1:00:30| So it's leased before, subleased to LMU, and now we're just cleaning up the world and having a new lease?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3630)|
| 1:00:35| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3635)|
| 1:00:35| Although it does extend it from not from 1932, from 2032 to 2040.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3635)|
| 1:00:43| But the operative cause is to get the right lessee on the paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3643)|
| 1:00:47| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3647)|
| 1:00:47| And then we're giving them an extension as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3647)|
| 1:00:48| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3648)|
| 1:00:49| Give them an eight-year extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3649)|

| 1:01:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3689)|
| 1:01:29| I'm going to support this resolution, but I did want to say I've both spoken to Becky Wade as well as the folks at HomeSource, and they seem to have a very good program and a good plan for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3689)|
| 1:01:45| I do want to say that there are some people in the area that are concerned about the idea of a great, what, perhaps providing too much low-income housing in an area that already suffers from that issue and affects how it is developed and how it progresses over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3705)|
| 1:02:08| This property, I think, is one that is well-intended and seems to have very good people running it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3728)|
| 1:02:15| There is, at the same time, an old hotel across the street that may have as many as 85 or 100 units that has a proposal by someone who's had a great deal of criminal activity in his other properties, and we're concerned that we may inadvertently open the floodgates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3735)|
| 1:02:36| So while we support affordable, low-income housing, we do not want to damage an area, and I think we need to be mindful of that when that comes up later in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3756)|
| 1:02:47| So I just wanted to make that comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=3767)|

| 1:07:54| It kind of just slides that way to the vehicle purchases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=4074)|
| 1:07:58| and then L is used more for our maintenance part where, like I said, we are buying parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=4078)|
| 1:08:05| We can capitalize our maintenance facility itself and the people, actually, that are in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=4085)|
| 1:08:12| We can capitalize those dollars and use them more wisely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil161122?start=4092)|
