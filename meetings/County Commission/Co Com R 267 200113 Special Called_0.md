| 0:01:04| All members are present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=64)|
| 0:01:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=65)|
| 0:01:06| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=66)|
| 0:01:07| I know we might have some folks watching from home, and we may even have some folks who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=67)|
| 0:01:10| are present in the audience for their first time actually attending or watching a meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=70)|
| 0:01:15| of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=75)|
| 0:01:16| So I'd like to just sort of kind of lay out what's happening at the meeting tonight, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=76)|
| 0:01:21| also just kind of a general but very brief overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=81)|
| 0:01:25| Knox County Commission has our regular scheduled meetings usually on the third and fourth Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=85)|
| 0:01:32| of each month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=92)|
| 0:01:33| Usually the first meeting is a work session where we drill down and talk about items in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=93)|
| 0:01:38| great detail and try to build a final agenda, which is then considered at usually the fourth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=98)|
| 0:01:46| Monday of the month, which is where we actually vote on specific items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=106)|
| 0:01:51| This meeting is a specially called meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=111)|
| 0:01:54| Mayor Jacobs called it to allow us to have a focused discussion and Q&A specific to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=114)|
| 0:02:02| TVA East Tower and Summer Place complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=122)|
| 0:02:05| Frankly, from my perspective, and I share this with my fellow commissioners, I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=125)|
| 0:02:12| that if this had been on the discussion for the work session next Monday, it probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=132)|
| 0:02:16| would have contributed to dragging that meeting out to a particularly long meeting, and I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=136)|
| 0:02:20| glad to have, though I doubt everything will be answered, but I'm glad to have some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=140)|
| 0:02:24| this, a dedicated meeting to focus on these particular items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=144)|
| 0:02:28| I also want to say to anyone watching at home or anyone present, we're not going to be voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=148)|
| 0:02:33| on anything tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=153)|
| 0:02:34| This is just a discussion, and I'll call up Mayor Jacobs in just a moment to review that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=154)|
| 0:02:41| and I'll also, Mayor Jacobs shared with me just a moment ago that he's got several things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=161)|
| 0:02:47| that he'd like to go over with us and a few different presenters, and I'd like to encourage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=167)|
| 0:02:52| my fellow commissioners to, Mayor Jacobs' words, to hold your questions until the end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=172)|
| 0:02:56| to give all the presenters a chance to say, and then I'm sure we can probably ask them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=176)|
| 0:03:00| questions as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=180)|
| 0:03:03| So with that said, the Chair recognizes Mayor Glenn Jacobs to come in and kind of give us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=183)|
| 0:03:10| an overview of what your plan is for the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=190)|
| 0:03:13| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=193)|
| 0:03:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=194)|
| 0:03:17| By the way, Mayor Jacobs, please forgive me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=197)|
| 0:03:19| I forgot to do the Pledge of Allegiance here at the start of the meeting, so Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=199)|
| 0:03:24| Gill, would you please lead us in the pledge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=204)|
| 0:03:26| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=206)|
| 0:03:27| Please stand if you're capable and salute our nation's flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=207)|
| 0:03:31| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=211)|
| 0:03:37| which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=217)|
| 0:03:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=225)|
| 0:03:46| Be seated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=226)|
| 0:03:48| Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=228)|
| 0:03:49| Mayor Jacobs, the floor is yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=229)|
| 0:03:51| Mr. Chairman, Commissioners, and everybody here, thank you for being here this afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=231)|
| 0:03:58| to discuss a great opportunity before us, an opportunity to save the taxpayers of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=238)|
| 0:04:05| County millions of dollars over the next several decades, an opportunity to secure modern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=245)|
| 0:04:13| newly renovated office space in downtown Knoxville for pennies on the dollar compared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=253)|
| 0:04:20| to current market rates, an opportunity to procure a large parking garage for a fraction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=260)|
| 0:04:28| of the market price, and an opportunity to produce private development and important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=268)|
| 0:04:34| economic engine by placing attractive and valuable properties back where they belong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=274)|
| 0:04:42| in private hands, which will not only produce tax revenue, but potentially could transform| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=282)|
| 0:04:50| an entire economic corridor, perhaps more than one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=290)|
| 0:04:54| These are the opportunities the TVA East Tower proposal presents to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=294)|
| 0:05:02| As we all know, and I am very aware, this is a complex proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=302)|
| 0:05:09| So the goal of this meeting is to provide you with as much information as possible and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=309)|
| 0:05:15| to answer any questions that you might have so that you can make an informed and responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=315)|
| 0:05:20| decision when voting on this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=320)|
| 0:05:24| I would reiterate, as the Chairman asked, to please respectfully ask to please hold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=324)|
| 0:05:32| your questions until the end of the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=332)|
| 0:05:34| We have a number of folks that will be talking up here with a slideshow and will be happy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=334)|
| 0:05:40| after the presentation to answer any questions that you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=340)|
| 0:05:44| Thank you all very much and I think Mr. Caldwell is first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=344)|
| 0:05:55| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=355)|
| 0:05:58| We'll go ahead and start with my first slide, which is basically an overview of the transaction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=358)|
| 0:06:04| that's in front of you for the January meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=364)|
| 0:06:08| Effectively, what we get to do is acquire the Summer Place complex, which consists of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=368)|
| 0:06:14| a 700-space parking garage, approximately 60,000 square feet of usable office space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=374)|
| 0:06:21| and approximately 50,000 square feet of storage space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=381)|
| 0:06:25| We always say that Summer Place broke up into three kind of complexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=385)|
| 0:06:32| We view the garage as one, the building as two, and the office space as three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=392)|
| 0:06:39| And also, of course, we effectively are leasing the upper 12 floors of the TBA East Tower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=399)|
| 0:06:44| and adjacent parking lots known as Fritz Lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=404)|
| 0:06:47| For those of you who don't know what the Fritz Lot is, it's basically the lot that is beside Visit Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=407)|
| 0:06:53| We'll go on to the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=413)|
| 0:06:56| The cost to acquire Summer Place complex is $1.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=416)|
| 0:07:03| And we know that approximately we'll need approximately $2 million on top of that in building improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=423)|
| 0:07:11| which is including replacing the chilling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=431)|
| 0:07:15| TBA has agreed to provide us chilled water until May of 2021,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=435)|
| 0:07:20| so it gives us some time to build in to do the chilled water that we know has to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=440)|
| 0:07:28| I'll continue on to the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=448)|
| 0:07:32| So, as I'm sure you're well aware, our initial lease rate rent is 37.5 cents a square foot annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=452)|
| 0:07:43| And it goes to about 70 cents per square foot by the 15th year of the lease, which is the initial term of the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=463)|
| 0:07:53| Comparable market rates downtown are well over $12 a square foot for such a comparative property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=473)|
| 0:08:02| We do know there will be small rent increases after any renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=482)|
| 0:08:07| So we have an initial 15-year term, then five five-year renewals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=487)|
| 0:08:12| Each renewal is at 1%, so every year will be 1%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=492)|
| 0:08:19| We have negotiated to do a lump sum rent payment for the Fritz Lot for the entire initial 15-year period for $208,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=499)|
| 0:08:31| There will be some smaller rent payments for renewal periods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=511)|
| 0:08:34| We did this up front because it resulted in like a 9% discount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=514)|
| 0:08:41| We know that there are O&M expenses anywhere you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=521)|
| 0:08:46| And so the O&M expenses at the East Tower we are estimating to be $4 a square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=526)|
| 0:08:56| And just so you know, there will be a true-up every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=536)|
| 0:09:00| So every year us and TVA will sit down with TVA, assuming the deal gets approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=540)|
| 0:09:07| to where we look at what the true cost was of our O&M cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=547)|
| 0:09:13| And if it's less, then they pay us some money back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=553)|
| 0:09:18| If it's more, we pay them some money back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=558)|
| 0:09:20| But we know that I think the number that TVA paid out in O&M costs last year was $3.68.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=560)|
| 0:09:29| I'm pretty sure it was that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=569)|
| 0:09:32| Moving on, TVA has made substantial improvements to the East Tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=572)|
| 0:09:41| They are in the middle of upgrading the HVAC system, which is both towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=581)|
| 0:09:48| So just to give you an idea of how to think about the buildings at TVA, it's one building with two vertical wings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=588)|
| 0:09:56| And so what they do to one, they do to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=596)|
| 0:09:59| So they're doing HVAC improvements that we get to take part in as far as being the user.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=599)|
| 0:10:11| And then once that is done, they're going to put a new chiller on top of the East Tower and redo the roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=611)|
| 0:10:17| And so those are things that we don't have to worry about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=617)|
| 0:10:20| And as a leasee, we don't have to worry about it anyway because any type of mechanical or things like that, they cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=620)|
| 0:10:31| What it's going to cost us to occupy the East Tower, so our build-out cost is just a little south of $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=631)|
| 0:10:41| We estimate that $9,975,000 is what it's going to cost us to place, whether it be schools or the county, in the East Tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=641)|
| 0:10:56| This includes design, demolition, build-out, and FF&E, and moving expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=656)|
| 0:11:04| So all that is included in the total, and that is just the East Tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=664)|
| 0:11:11| And so you can do the math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=671)|
| 0:11:16| That's really a great deal and something that we've looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=676)|
| 0:11:20| And we'll get into a little bit later on about other options and cost related to that and focus on that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=680)|
| 0:11:29| Anticipated agreement with UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=689)|
| 0:11:31| So this is an important slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=691)|
| 0:11:34| We have had numerous conversations with UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=694)|
| 0:11:38| They are very excited about the potential of being a sub-leasee with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=698)|
| 0:11:47| In this agreement, UT would occupy floors 7 through 12 and pay us for all their renovations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=707)|
| 0:11:55| So we don't pay for their renovations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=715)|
| 0:11:58| They cover it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=718)|
| 0:12:00| Their rent payment would be a dollar a square foot in year one and would escalate by 1% annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=720)|
| 0:12:08| Also, UT would pay its share of operating expenses attributable to its floors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=728)|
| 0:12:14| and so we will work with them to come up with that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=734)|
| 0:12:18| And so we've had really great ongoing conversations with UT, and you'll hear from a few of those individuals tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=738)|
| 0:12:29| We'll start with David Miller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=749)|
| 0:12:31| He's the CFO of the UT system, and he's going to come to speak with us on this topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=751)|
| 0:12:39| Good afternoon, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=759)|
| 0:12:40| Thank you, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=760)|
| 0:12:41| Thank you, Mayor, for the opportunity to present UT's view of this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=761)|
| 0:12:48| We have a pressing need with about 75 staff who are in the UT Conference Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=768)|
| 0:12:56| You may know it better as the old Miller's department store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=776)|
| 0:12:59| We have to move them out of there by really the early next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=779)|
| 0:13:05| to allow for moving into their health sciences-related academic department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=785)|
| 0:13:11| So we began looking at commercial space, and we would have yet another lease space somewhere around the Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=791)|
| 0:13:19| Chris, we were looking at $18 a square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=799)|
| 0:13:21| I don't know about 12, but that may be quite low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=801)|
| 0:13:25| So I would spend about $365,000 a year to house those 75 people and solve that one problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=805)|
| 0:13:34| When this proposal came about, we realized it would solve many problems for the university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=814)|
| 0:13:40| First of all, I'm representing and am the CFO of the statewide University of Tennessee, not the UT Knoxville campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=820)|
| 0:13:48| That's one of our campuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=828)|
| 0:13:50| But the offices we will be moving into the TVA Tower will be those of the statewide system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=830)|
| 0:13:57| the president, the board of trustees, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=837)|
| 0:14:00| We're spread over four buildings right now over six miles in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=840)|
| 0:14:06| So it's a great opportunity for the University of Tennessee system to finally have a home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=846)|
| 0:14:12| to all be in one place and be distinct from the UT Knoxville campus and administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=852)|
| 0:14:19| But that idea has been kicking around for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=859)|
| 0:14:24| If this were not the financial proposal that it was, I would be opposed to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=864)|
| 0:14:30| because a university's least important expenditure is administrative expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=870)|
| 0:14:37| And it would be difficult to find funding in our existing budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=877)|
| 0:14:43| or to go to the state for funding for just administrative expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| But at a dollar a square foot, it becomes completely irresistible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=887)|
| 0:14:52| So we would take, as Chris said, the top six floors, about 105,000 assignable square feet for about $650,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=892)|
| 0:15:03| I'll have 105,000 square feet or enough for all of the University of Tennessee system administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=903)|
| 0:15:11| plus the University of Tennessee Foundation will finally all be in one place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=911)|
| 0:15:16| At less than half the cost, I'll have to go spend just to get 75 people out of the conference room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=916)|
| 0:15:23| Because it has parking adjacent, that's also an added benefit, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=923)|
| 0:15:30| We'll have a share of the parking for which we will pay an additional amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=930)|
| 0:15:34| But we wanted to let you know why the University of Tennessee is so interested in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=934)|
| 0:15:40| It's an opportunity that you just don't get very often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=940)|
| 0:15:44| And from a CFO's perspective, it's irresistible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=944)|
| 0:15:48| We really don't have any other opportunities to build or lease space at a commercial rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=948)|
| 0:15:54| that would solve all of those problems for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=957)|
| 0:16:03| We appreciate David coming to take time out of his day to talk about this potential partnership with UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=963)|
| 0:16:11| A partnership with UT system, which is a statewide system for Knox County, is advantageous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=971)|
| 0:16:17| And the idea of having them in the same building as our school system is something that I think is desirable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=977)|
| 0:16:23| The next slide, I think, is a very telling slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=983)|
| 0:16:27| I think so because it's numbers and you know how I am with numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=987)|
| 0:16:30| And so I want to just go over this just briefly with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=990)|
| 0:16:35| Our estimated TVA East Tower operational expenses is just a little shy of $840,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=995)|
| 0:16:44| So that's what we would pay to be in the East Tower annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1004)|
| 0:16:53| When you net out some revenues, you're going to get to a net number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1013)|
| 0:16:57| So we're going to get new revenue from leasing the space to UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1017)|
| 0:17:03| And that net number is a little over $65,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1023)|
| 0:17:07| The revenue from the parking garage, which we are purchasing for the UT spaces, is $180,000 annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1027)|
| 0:17:16| The school system parking revenue is about $108,000 annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1036)|
| 0:17:23| And so you net those out and we have a net operating expenses of a little north of $486,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1043)|
| 0:17:34| Compare that to what the school is currently paying for the AJ building and that's a little over $884,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1054)|
| 0:17:43| So by going forward with this proposal, annual savings on operating expenses is right at $400,000 annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1063)|
| 0:17:56| $400,000 that we don't have to put out for operating expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1076)|
| 0:18:01| As a matter of fact, the school's operating expenses go from $884,000 to $0,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1081)|
| 0:18:06| And we will cover the $400,000, assuming the Board of Education and the county approve the MOU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1086)|
| 0:18:15| which will be coming forward probably in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1095)|
| 0:18:18| And so I think this is an important slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1098)|
| 0:18:20| It's not every day that you can look to move and your operating expenses actually decrease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1100)|
| 0:18:29| At this time, you are finished with me and I'm going to turn it over to Mark Mametoff to start on the legal overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1109)|
| 0:18:40| Thank you, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1120)|
| 0:18:41| Excuse me again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1121)|
| 0:18:42| You have all seen me before, but I'm Mark Mametoff and I serve as Bond Counsel to the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1122)|
| 0:18:47| and also as part of our relationship as Bond Counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1127)|
| 0:18:51| Chris can use this for special projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1131)|
| 0:18:53| I want to make it clear I'm not speaking on behalf of the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1133)|
| 0:18:56| Obviously, the law directors here can address any questions, concerns he has at any point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1136)|
| 0:19:02| But I'm here speaking in my capacity in helping the mayor and the finance department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1142)|
| 0:19:10| So what are you actually being asked to vote on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1150)|
| 0:19:13| Well, the three big documents are the easements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1153)|
| 0:19:16| One is the permanent easement for the Summer Place Complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1156)|
| 0:19:19| That's what's critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1159)|
| 0:19:20| It is permanent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1160)|
| 0:19:22| It cannot be terminated unless we absolutely walk away and don't leave a single person even checking on the facility from time to time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1162)|
| 0:19:30| There is essentially no risk that we would ever lose the right to control that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1170)|
| 0:19:34| And that has been something we've negotiated very, very hard to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1174)|
| 0:19:38| The other thing that has taken us almost a year and a half to get in front of you is the right to transfer the property someday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1178)|
| 0:19:44| That property has a lot of fiber lines running into it for the benefit of TVA and some other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1184)|
| 0:19:50| And they are very reluctant to give us the ability to sell that very easily because it could affect their fiber access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1190)|
| 0:19:58| And so we've negotiated and negotiated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1198)|
| 0:20:00| And effectively, after a period of time, we're able to sell it with very little constraints from TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1200)|
| 0:20:05| If we should so choose to do so, my guess is that the revenues from the garage are going to be so attractive that we don't have a reason to sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1205)|
| 0:20:12| But we will essentially own a 700-space garage, get all the revenue from it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1212)|
| 0:20:17| and on top of that, get 110,000 feet of heated space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1217)|
| 0:20:21| Is it the most beautiful heated space? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1221)|
| 0:20:23| Is it usable heated space? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1223)|
| 0:20:26| There are people in there. Digital Crossing is in there right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1226)|
| 0:20:29| And certainly with some minimal expense, you could lease it as Class C office space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1229)|
| 0:20:34| The term easements for the TVA East Tower and Fritz are for 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1234)|
| 0:20:38| They have five five-year options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| So we could stay there for 40 years if you wanted to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1240)|
| 0:20:44| effectively the useful life of that building without further renovations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1244)|
| 0:20:49| And they're putting extensive renovations in it right now, such as elevators are being redone and a lot of safety things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1249)|
| 0:20:55| They've added additional fire safety access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1255)|
| 0:20:58| And so there's a lot being done to the East Tower prior to whether, you know, if the county chooses to take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1258)|
| 0:21:05| So these are long-term, effectively operate like leases, but they are characterized as easements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1265)|
| 0:21:13| And I'll come back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1273)|
| 0:21:15| So as the next slide discussed, why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1275)|
| 0:21:17| Why did we have to use this easement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1277)|
| 0:21:20| Is it my preference? No, I hate these easements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1280)|
| 0:21:23| I would have loved to get a deed and a lease, just as Bud would tell you he would love to have a deed and a lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1283)|
| 0:21:29| That would have been very nice, and I would have been in front of you a year ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1289)|
| 0:21:32| and you all would have liked me a whole lot more, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| But we don't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1294)|
| 0:21:36| Why do we not have that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1296)|
| 0:21:37| And I really believe TVA is telling the truth here, is if they choose to do a lease or a sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1297)|
| 0:21:43| if they try to sell the Summer Place Complex to us, they have to put it up for public auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1303)|
| 0:21:48| If they decide to lease the TVA East Tower, they have to put it up for public auction by federal law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1308)|
| 0:21:54| And if they do that, they can't link them together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1314)|
| 0:21:57| So the TVA East Tower could go to one body, and a developer could come in and buy the parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1317)|
| 0:22:02| so you would not have any parking for the East Tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| That just simply would not work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1325)|
| 0:22:07| The only way we can do this is if we get the parking garage with the East Tower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1327)|
| 0:22:10| and if you don't get them hand-in-hand, you basically have either a worthless building with no parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1330)|
| 0:22:15| or you have a parking garage, which I probably would take at the price that they're getting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1335)|
| 0:22:19| but we would have to go and bid against private developers to get a 700-space parking garage in downtown Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1339)|
| 0:22:26| which I can assure you is worth a whole lot more than the $1.6 million that we're supposed to pay for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1346)|
| 0:22:31| So that is why we're doing an auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1351)|
| 0:22:34| It certainly was not the law department's preference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| It was not my preference, and that's why it's taken so long to get it through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1356)|
| 0:22:39| These are complex documents with a lot of difficult legal issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1359)|
| 0:22:45| But does an easement give us adequate protection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1365)|
| 0:22:49| When you think of an easement, I'm sure you're thinking, wait a minute, that's how I get to my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1369)|
| 0:22:53| I've got an easement to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1373)|
| 0:22:55| It can be much broader than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1375)|
| 0:22:57| This is what's called an easement in gross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1377)|
| 0:22:59| It basically is a personal easement to the county to control these properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1379)|
| 0:23:03| It's a well-recognized interest in real property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1383)|
| 0:23:07| It's like a deed as to Summer Place and like a lease as to the East Tower and as to the Fritz lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1387)|
| 0:23:15| So, and this is, I mean, TBA doesn't like to talk about this publicly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1395)|
| 0:23:21| but the bottom line is once we do the permanent easement on Summer Place, what do they own?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1401)|
| 0:23:25| They own the underlying fee interest that is worthless to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1405)|
| 0:23:29| They can't do anything with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1409)|
| 0:23:30| We control it totally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| They have no incentive to hold on to that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1412)|
| 0:23:35| So seven years from now or whenever, I put on my calendar, but I'll probably be retired by then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1415)|
| 0:23:40| one of us is going to need to go up there and say, TBA, would you please sell the fee interest now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1420)|
| 0:23:44| And they will have no reason not to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1424)|
| 0:23:46| They just can't link the two together by federal law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| And that's what they've told us numerous times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1430)|
| 0:23:52| So we will go to TBA, we'll ask them to sell the fee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1432)|
| 0:23:55| and then we'll own, hopefully, the Summer Place, Cleveland, and Freer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1435)|
| 0:23:58| but it's not going to be for several years, and I don't want to mislead you all about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1438)|
| 0:24:04| And if we decide to sell in the future, I believe, and we're going to have some folks address this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1444)|
| 0:24:07| that we can get the fair market value of what a garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1447)|
| 0:24:10| I can tell you a 700-space garage in downtown Knoxville is basically sold by space and be well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1450)|
| 0:24:15| you know, certainly probably over $20 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1455)|
| 0:24:17| and we've used $15 million in several of these estimates that we have in front of you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1457)|
| 0:24:23| How do we know these easements are even enforceable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| Well, and I certainly thank the law director for pushing this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1465)|
| 0:24:30| because it's very helpful to me as we're going to get a legal opinion from the general counsel of TBA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1470)|
| 0:24:34| that this has all been legally done, authorized by TBA, and that these easements are enforceable against TBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1474)|
| 0:24:40| It's going to be kind of hard for them to argue that these easements aren't enforceable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1480)|
| 0:24:43| if their own chief legal officer has said that they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| And so I think that we have very little risk that TBA will ever argue that there's anything illegal about these easements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1486)|
| 0:24:52| number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1492)|
| 0:24:53| Number two is we'll get title insurance, ensuring that these easements are legally created,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1493)|
| 0:24:58| real estate interest in the property that we're doing, and we've got a title commitment to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1498)|
| 0:25:04| So I think that we're going to protect ourselves well as to the legality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1504)|
| 0:25:08| But, you know, I've worked on this so long, it's sort of things like, am I objective?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1508)|
| 0:25:11| You know, can I really, do these easements adequately protect the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1511)|
| 0:25:15| So I've sort of started questioning even myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1515)|
| 0:25:19| You know, Charlie Kirk and I have spent a lot of time on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1519)|
| 0:25:21| and at some point it just sort of starts running around your head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1521)|
| 0:25:24| So I've asked for a few people to come and talk to you all, because you've seen me up here before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1524)|
| 0:25:29| I've asked, and I'm going to introduce all three of the folks that are going to talk to you at one time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1529)|
| 0:25:34| and then just ask them to come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1534)|
| 0:25:36| I've asked Joe Huey to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1536)|
| 0:25:37| Many of you all may know Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1537)|
| 0:25:39| Joe, for the long time, was sort of the lead title guy at Tennessee Valley Title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| I've worked with Joe for 35 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| Joe recently retired, although he sneaks in and does a title search every now and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1545)|
| 0:25:49| But Joe has worked on tons of projects, including projects involving easements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1549)|
| 0:25:55| I asked him to look these over and asked him if he felt like these adequately protected the county's interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1555)|
| 0:25:59| in being able to have control of the properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1559)|
| 0:26:02| He's going to chat with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1562)|
| 0:26:03| One great thing about having UT involved is they've looked at the documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1563)|
| 0:26:07| They said, hey, and I can assure you, because I've negotiated with UT, that they're very, very conservative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1567)|
| 0:26:12| We're not talking about some gunslingers out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1572)|
| 0:26:15| We're talking about folks that are protecting the taxpayer dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1575)|
| 0:26:18| So they've looked over the easements from TVA because they would be sub-easementing from us, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1578)|
| 0:26:23| You're not going to do this if they don't think they have the legal right to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1583)|
| 0:26:26| So Ryan Sennett, the interim general counsel for UT, is here as well as Katie Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1586)|
| 0:26:31| who I've worked with extensively over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1591)|
| 0:26:33| And they're going to explain to them UT's view on the legal aspects of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1593)|
| 0:26:38| You've already heard from David Miller what a home run this is financially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| And I've asked George Brown from Wood Properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| Many of you all probably know Wood Properties is one of the leading real estate firms here in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1603)|
| 0:26:47| George often advises the county and was instrumental in identifying sites for the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1607)|
| 0:26:52| And George will comment on the marketability of the easements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1612)|
| 0:26:56| if you all should someday, say, choose to sell the summer place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1616)|
| 0:26:59| I'm going to turn it over to those three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1619)|
| 0:27:00| Joe, if you wouldn't mind coming up next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1620)|
| 0:27:05| Thank you, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1625)|
| 0:27:06| My name is Joe Huey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| I retired in 2018 after almost 41 years in the title insurance business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1628)|
| 0:27:20| Agreeing with Mark, I think everyone would prefer to have a deed and a lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1640)|
| 0:27:26| But given the realities, TBA can't do that in this scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1646)|
| 0:27:37| We'd have to put it out for bid and the county would be competing with whoever else thought they might take a run at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1657)|
| 0:27:47| The documents that I've looked at grant easements, term easements in two of the pieces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1667)|
| 0:27:57| and a permanent easement for the garage property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1677)|
| 0:28:00| The net effect of the term easement is just almost identical to what a ground lease or a lease would be, not a ground lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1680)|
| 0:28:14| And likewise, the effect of the ground lease for the summer place complex is not feasible, but it's darn close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1694)|
| 0:28:28| We have at our title company have done a number of transactions over the years where TBA has handled marina properties this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1708)|
| 0:28:46| And it's worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1726)|
| 0:28:52| I think everybody's gone on happy and have gotten what they wanted from an operational standpoint and a legal standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1732)|
| 0:29:04| We've insured, I don't know how many, but several of those titles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1744)|
| 0:29:09| And over the years I've done other easements on lease situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1749)|
| 0:29:16| primarily investors buying up cellular telephone tower sites where they go to the farmer and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1756)|
| 0:29:28| pay him a lump sum payment for that income stream spread out over the term of these cellular tower site leases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1768)|
| 0:29:37| So it's not, like I say, it's not the preferred way, but it is certainly not uncommon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1777)|
| 0:29:49| Mark reminded me that even a portion of the garage, I think, for the Riverview Tower is on an easement that was granted by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1789)|
| 0:30:01| So, like I say, these are not uncommon at all and have not caused any issues that I've ever been made aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1801)|
| 0:30:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1815)|
| 0:30:23| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1823)|
| 0:30:25| My name is Ryan Stannett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1825)|
| 0:30:26| As Mark said, I'm Interim General Counsel at UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1826)|
| 0:30:29| I'm here with Katie Lane from our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1829)|
| 0:30:31| She is Associate General Counsel at the university, and we appreciate the opportunity to speak with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1831)|
| 0:30:37| and address you this afternoon about this proposed transaction on behalf of the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1837)|
| 0:30:42| As David Miller does as CFO, our office represents the University of Tennessee system-wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1842)|
| 0:30:48| We look at, we handle on behalf of the university a lot of real property transactions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1848)|
| 0:30:53| so we are regularly involved in this field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1853)|
| 0:30:57| Our office has, in fact, reviewed the proposed agreements, drafts of the easements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1857)|
| 0:31:02| and the other related agreements between the county and TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1862)|
| 0:31:06| We agree with Mr. Mametov's legal opinion that these easements essentially result in a lease of the TVA East Tower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1866)|
| 0:31:15| and the Fritz Lot to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1875)|
| 0:31:18| Easements, as he said, are commonly used and fully enforceable under Tennessee law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1878)|
| 0:31:23| UT, as our CFO David Miller said, is prepared and excited about the opportunity to move into this space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1883)|
| 0:31:31| and our office is fully prepared to accept a subeasement of the space in the TVA East Tower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1891)|
| 0:31:41| and we're fully comfortable with the proposed legal structure that you're considering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1901)|
| 0:31:47| Our office has no legal concerns about using a subeasement as a contractual basis for the university itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1907)|
| 0:31:54| using space in the TVA Tower as a subtenant to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1914)|
| 0:32:00| In fact, we believe that UT would have fundamentally the same rights, obligations, and responsibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1920)|
| 0:32:07| under a subeasement with the county as we would have in a sublease with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1927)|
| 0:32:14| So ultimately, we believe this is a legally sound way to move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1934)|
| 0:32:18| and we think it's a great opportunity for the university system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1938)|
| 0:32:21| and we certainly look forward, if the commission approves this transaction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1941)|
| 0:32:25| to working with the county to negotiate a subeasement that is agreeable to both parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1945)|
| 0:32:31| We'd be glad to answer any questions at the end of the presentation on behalf of the university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1951)|
| 0:32:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1955)|
| 0:32:42| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1962)|
| 0:32:43| My name is George Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1963)|
| 0:32:45| As Mark said, I lead a company called Wood Properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1965)|
| 0:32:48| We're about a 44-year-old company here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1968)|
| 0:32:51| and I have had the pleasure of leading it for the last three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1971)|
| 0:32:55| but have been a broker there for the last 10 years and actually focused in downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1975)|
| 0:33:01| So I'd say that I'm here today as both a commercial real estate professional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1981)|
| 0:33:08| but also as a downtown Knoxville specialist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1988)|
| 0:33:11| I love downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1991)|
| 0:33:12| I'm passionate about downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| I was an intern at TVA in the East Tower of all places when I was at UT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1994)|
| 0:33:19| writing for the Daily Beacon and did a story on a building owned by a guy named David Dewhurst| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=1999)|
| 0:33:24| and fell in love with downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2004)|
| 0:33:27| And since that time, I've served on the CVID Development Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2007)|
| 0:33:31| and am always a cheerleader for downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2011)|
| 0:33:35| So in fact, before Mark asked me to participate tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2015)|
| 0:33:39| I was aware of this deal and was in support of it for a handful of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2019)|
| 0:33:43| Mark asked me to touch on a few of the financial aspects of it from a real estate market standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2023)|
| 0:33:51| He did not ask me to comment on this, but I'm going to just because I think it's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2031)|
| 0:33:56| And that is a couple of things that you might not think about or talk about tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2036)|
| 0:34:01| but one of them is a fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2041)|
| 0:34:03| And that is if you think about what buildings were built for and how they're being used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2043)|
| 0:34:09| And so, for example, the TVA towers were built for office use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2049)|
| 0:34:13| And over the years, as TVA contracted and they were trying to sell or lease all or parts of that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2053)|
| 0:34:22| it has sat for a long time because it's a very challenging property for the market to absorb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2062)|
| 0:34:27| Because of TVA and the security, it's just a challenging property for office users.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2067)|
| 0:34:33| And so it's always been a tough property to fill up from a market standpoint since TVA contracted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2073)|
| 0:34:40| So the idea of being able to put a county use in there to bring that building back to life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2080)|
| 0:34:45| and have it fully utilized as an office use is a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2085)|
| 0:34:49| In addition to that, you think about the AJ building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| That was built as a hotel, not as an office building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2092)|
| 0:34:55| So I would argue that it's a functionally obsolete building for office use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2095)|
| 0:35:00| So the idea of taking the county employees, including the Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2100)|
| 0:35:04| and putting them in an office setting, I think the quality of the work environment will probably increase substantially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2104)|
| 0:35:10| In addition to that, you take that building that was built for a hotel or residential purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2110)|
| 0:35:15| and put it back for that purpose, you bring that property back to what its original intent was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2115)|
| 0:35:21| One of the other things, so not only a fit, both of those being a good fit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2121)|
| 0:35:25| is just thinking about downtown Knoxville and what do we want to see happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2125)|
| 0:35:29| One, we'd love to see the TVA towers full of people, not half full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2129)|
| 0:35:35| And then two, the 900 block of Gay Street on nights and weekends is pretty quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2135)|
| 0:35:40| So to see that brought back as a hotel use with restaurant and people coming in and out of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2140)|
| 0:35:46| tying in with what's going on in South Knoxville would really bring that block of Gay Street to life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2146)|
| 0:35:52| So those are a couple of things I just want to talk about before I got into the things that Mark asked me to speak about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2152)|
| 0:35:59| The first question he asked me to address is the rent payment being paid for the east hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2159)|
| 0:36:06| Where is that in the marketplace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2166)|
| 0:36:10| You cannot find office space as cheap as what this deal proposes to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2170)|
| 0:36:15| The county, I believe through the research that we supplied some data, they're using $12 a foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2175)|
| 0:36:21| I think what they've done is they've pulled out the operating expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2181)|
| 0:36:24| When you add $4 a foot to that, you're at about $16, which $16 is probably about right for downtown Knoxville office space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2184)|
| 0:36:31| We handle leasing for the Riverview Tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2191)|
| 0:36:33| Our list rate is $17.50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2193)|
| 0:36:35| That's a full service rate, including janitorial, utilities, taxes, everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2195)|
| 0:36:40| The first Tennessee building is about $17 per square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2200)|
| 0:36:43| Two center squares in that $16 to $17 range as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2203)|
| 0:36:47| And then the Langley building, I think currently they've got some space that's kind of on the lower level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2207)|
| 0:36:53| That's the former Kimberly-Clark building, and that one I think is about $14 a foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2213)|
| 0:36:58| None of those include parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| The cost of parking, which on a per square foot per person basis adds about $4 to the rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2220)|
| 0:37:06| So it's just an incredibly low rate when you look at it in the marketplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2226)|
| 0:37:11| And then the second point he asked me to address was that the purchase price of the Summer Place complex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2231)|
| 0:37:19| where is that in the marketplace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| And there again, you can't find anything that cheap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2241)|
| 0:37:25| So just looking at the parking alone, I pulled up some parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2245)|
| 0:37:31| There is no comparable sales of parking garages in downtown Knoxville, I can tell you that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2251)|
| 0:37:36| But if you look at some parking lots that have sold not too long ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2256)|
| 0:37:40| the lot, if you're facing Mass General, the lot to the left that sits below Gay Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2260)|
| 0:37:45| a hotel developer paid $2.5 million for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2265)|
| 0:37:48| There's about 70 to 80 parking spaces on that surface lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2268)|
| 0:37:53| And another recent transaction was back on State Street between Church and Clinch, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2273)|
| 0:38:03| that Hatcher Hill bought and leases to Tombris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2283)|
| 0:38:08| They paid about $1.23 for about 145 spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2288)|
| 0:38:12| So just looking, again, they're not entirely comparable because they're surface lots compared to a parking deck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2292)|
| 0:38:18| But they indicate much lower prices than the $1.6 represents to acquire the Summer Place complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2298)|
| 0:38:27| Lastly, just a comment would be that I just pulled this up just out of curiosity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2307)|
| 0:38:34| I'm assuming this is the city tax assessor values the Summer Place complex at $19 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2314)|
| 0:38:40| So Mark mentioned 15 was being used for, I think, some of the documents you've seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2320)|
| 0:38:46| I spoke with a developer who told me that structured parking is about $35,000 per space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2326)|
| 0:38:54| $35,000 per space for 700 spaces would cost about $25 million to build a parking garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2334)|
| 0:39:00| So whether you look at it from a rental perspective or cost of construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2340)|
| 0:39:06| or think about what would the county pay for that parking, the math is very easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2346)|
| 0:39:12| It's a very, very good deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2352)|
| 0:39:14| Lastly, I just did the math very quickly on the Fritz lot, which appears to have about 40 spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2354)|
| 0:39:21| That lot, my gut says, is about $125 a month per space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2361)|
| 0:39:27| Over 15 years, that would be $900,000 of parking costs for that lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2367)|
| 0:39:32| So there again, that price of $200,000 seems to be or is way below market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2372)|
| 0:39:38| Last point he asked me to address, just from a market standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2378)|
| 0:39:42| if I were being asked to sell as a broker, being asked to sell a property like Summer Place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2382)|
| 0:39:48| that had this permanent easement on it, would I expect that the marketplace would have a problem with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2388)|
| 0:39:53| and not want to buy it or pay less because of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2393)|
| 0:39:56| And so long as the legal people can tell me that it all checks out and that it's a permanent easement, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2396)|
| 0:40:02| The marketplace would not have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2402)|
| 0:40:05| People do ground leases and easements all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2405)|
| 0:40:09| It's not always fee simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2409)|
| 0:40:12| So I would not expect any problem with that from the marketplace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2412)|
| 0:40:17| if the county ever needed to try to sell that asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2417)|
| 0:40:21| So I think that's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2421)|
| 0:40:25| I'm happy to answer any questions at the end when we do the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2425)|
| 0:40:28| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2428)|
| 0:40:32| Thank you, George.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2432)|
| 0:40:33| I used to look like that 30 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2433)|
| 0:40:39| I'll be quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2439)|
| 0:40:40| We've got some LSU fans out here that are really excited, like Mike Odom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2440)|
| 0:40:45| So when he gets up here, he may be a little nervous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2445)|
| 0:40:50| Real quickly, you're going to be asked to vote on some other ancillary documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| They're listed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| There's an operating agreement that basically says how the whole complex is operated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2455)|
| 0:40:59| There's the chilled water supply agreement where they agreed to give us chilled water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2459)|
| 0:41:03| and we're not talking about for water fountains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| We're talking about to cool the building through May of 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2465)|
| 0:41:08| There's a security agreement, which they'll provide federally level security services to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2468)|
| 0:41:17| They need to lease back effectively some of the space in the Summer Place complex so they can get out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2477)|
| 0:41:22| They're moving it up to Norris, and so they need a short-term lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2482)|
| 0:41:26| We call it a license in this case, back for a short period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2486)|
| 0:41:30| And then we'll get the digital crossing lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2490)|
| 0:41:33| That's the main thing being assigned to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| So we have a nice income stream from the digital crossing lease immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2495)|
| 0:41:38| So that's another extra sum of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2498)|
| 0:41:40| And my last slide, and this has been a big issue, is what about the schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2500)|
| 0:41:45| What about the schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2505)|
| 0:41:46| If they go in there, can they do their business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| And so the issue there obviously is that TVA is part of a federal building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2508)|
| 0:41:53| You know they have nuclear plants and all that sort of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2513)|
| 0:41:56| We want them to be secure, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2516)|
| 0:41:57| And so they are secure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2517)|
| 0:41:59| When we first started this project, we thought the PBA would be able to run the security on the East Tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2519)|
| 0:42:04| Once TVA spent quite a bit of time looking at it and realizing that, hey, wait a minute here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2524)|
| 0:42:08| We've got a huge IT facility underneath the East Tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2528)|
| 0:42:11| We need federal level security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| We need to retain control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2533)|
| 0:42:15| We don't want crazy things going above us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| And so they said, look, we've got to provide the security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2537)|
| 0:42:20| So we have to live by federal security standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2540)|
| 0:42:22| There's pros and cons for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2542)|
| 0:42:24| They're fairly high level standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2544)|
| 0:42:26| And our school employees, if they choose to be there, and you all choose for them to be there, will have very good security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2546)|
| 0:42:34| And Jane will talk a little bit about that when she talks later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2554)|
| 0:42:39| I know that the law director's office has been concerned about what is called custody and control issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2559)|
| 0:42:44| And certainly, again, he'll be glad to advise you all about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2564)|
| 0:42:47| We're moving forward on, as we've talked about at a prior meeting, about asking for an AG opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2567)|
| 0:42:52| We're also looking for legislative solutions to make it clear that that won't be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2572)|
| 0:42:57| And the main concern, again, is that if TVA determines that a school employee is a security threat to TVA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2577)|
| 0:43:05| which would really mean being a national security threat, they could tell them that they can't work in that building until that is resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2585)|
| 0:43:12| And so that doesn't mean they would be fired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| They just would have to work somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2594)|
| 0:43:17| I am confident the schools don't want terrorists working for them either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2597)|
| 0:43:20| But if there is any question about it, there is a period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2600)|
| 0:43:24| And we built in, I feel like, very reasonable safeguards where there has to be ongoing discussions with the mayor and the superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2604)|
| 0:43:32| about if there are any security issues that we can't just treat people unfairly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2612)|
| 0:43:36| So we really worked hard to come up with the best compromise that we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2616)|
| 0:43:40| But TVA feels very strongly that they have to have the ultimate say if they believe someone is a national security risk working above them in the TVA tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2620)|
| 0:43:48| So I'm going to turn it over now to a little bit more deep dive into the finances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2628)|
| 0:43:56| And my friend Matt, who I grew up with actually, is going to come talk to you about the alternatives to moving into the TVA East Tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2636)|
| 0:44:08| Thank you, Mr. Mamentoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2648)|
| 0:44:09| Commissioners, I used to look like that about three years ago, but it's all changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2649)|
| 0:44:17| I do want to go over a few slides for you that we've got the alternatives to the TVA East Tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2657)|
| 0:44:23| Obviously, number one, we can remain in the A.J. building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2663)|
| 0:44:27| The space is terribly inefficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| It's costly to maintain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| And the property stays off the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| So that's one option that, you know, an alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2673)|
| 0:44:39| Another alternative is to construct a new office building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2679)|
| 0:44:43| We need land to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| As you heard Mr. Miller from UT, that is getting harder and harder to find every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2685)|
| 0:44:52| I know in talking with some of the school's personnel, we're struggling to find property for a northwest elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2692)|
| 0:45:01| You can't find centrally located property downtown either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2701)|
| 0:45:05| So that's a concern with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2705)|
| 0:45:10| The other one is to acquire and renovate an existing building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2710)|
| 0:45:15| Based on the programming needs that have been in discussions with schools, this is hard to find as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2715)|
| 0:45:22| Looking for 100,000, 105,000 or so square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2722)|
| 0:45:27| Haven't found that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| There are some, there are buildings with that amount of square feet, and I'll go over this in a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2730)|
| 0:45:38| but they're just not conducive to quality office space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2738)|
| 0:45:42| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2742)|
| 0:45:44| The next evaluation process that we did, it did commence in 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2744)|
| 0:45:49| I was a little bit involved in some of the early discussions with the properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2749)|
| 0:45:55| I think in 2017 we really got to looking and trying to find out what was out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2755)|
| 0:46:03| We had several discussions with the school administration to see what would work, what are your needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2763)|
| 0:46:10| what do you want to see in an office building, what do you want to provide for your employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2770)|
| 0:46:16| We had several walk-throughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| We walked through the TVA East Tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2778)|
| 0:46:21| We did walk the SunTrust building, and we also walked the Summer Place building as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2781)|
| 0:46:29| A lot of the, those sites that we looked at, they just, again, there just wasn't a fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2789)|
| 0:46:41| The SunTrust building just didn't have enough space for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2801)|
| 0:46:45| It was smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2805)|
| 0:46:47| We would have to build on, and parking is certainly an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2807)|
| 0:46:50| You've heard about the parking garage that we have the opportunity to acquire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2810)|
| 0:46:55| This is a very good opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| We've got to provide parking for the school system employees as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2817)|
| 0:47:02| Based on the amendable sites that we did look at, we asked Partners Development to prepare cost options for each one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2822)|
| 0:47:10| and you will see those shortly too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2830)|
| 0:47:13| Next, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2833)|
| 0:47:16| Updated alternatives, let me back up just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2836)|
| 0:47:19| In 2017, we asked Wood Properties to look at available properties that somewhat fit this square footage that we were looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2839)|
| 0:47:28| We asked them early this year in January to revise that list, and it trumped considerably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2848)|
| 0:47:37| There are just very few sites that have the square footage that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2857)|
| 0:47:41| Parking that is going to be required for that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2861)|
| 0:47:47| The updated alternatives that Wood provided us, we can do new construction at Rural High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2867)|
| 0:47:53| The football field, obviously, and many of you all know this, is for the most part flat, so we could start construction there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2873)|
| 0:48:01| Parking would still be an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2881)|
| 0:48:04| There's not adequate parking as it sits right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2884)|
| 0:48:09| We have the old park that is still standing, but we would still need to provide parking there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2889)|
| 0:48:16| We looked at big box locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2896)|
| 0:48:19| We looked on Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2899)|
| 0:48:21| We looked at Maynardville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2901)|
| 0:48:23| We've looked at these options, Kingston Pike and Morrell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2903)|
| 0:48:28| Those options are there, but they're just not conducive to an office facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2908)|
| 0:48:35| to that type of environment that the employees really would need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2915)|
| 0:48:40| Twenty, thirty feet in, you have no daylighting coming in any other place in the building except for the storefronts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2920)|
| 0:48:47| In addition to that, these build-outs are extremely expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2927)|
| 0:48:52| You have high ceilings, and as well, as you all probably know, they have very limited facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2932)|
| 0:49:00| So if you needed to revise the facilities for 230 employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2940)|
| 0:49:05| you are liable to have to start jackhammering the concrete floors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2945)|
| 0:49:10| because most of the piping and utilities are underground, under concrete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2950)|
| 0:49:16| Again, it will be an expensive fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2956)|
| 0:49:20| We looked at the Sun Trucks building, as I've mentioned before, and there's just not enough parking there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2960)|
| 0:49:27| We would have to add on, and not enough parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2967)|
| 0:49:31| At this point, I'd like to introduce Randy Jenkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2971)|
| 0:49:33| He's the Chief Financial Officer from Partners Development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2973)|
| 0:49:36| to go over some of the numbers on the amendable sites that we looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2976)|
| 0:49:43| Thank you, Commissioners. Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2983)|
| 0:49:46| We did, as Matt said, look at these four primary options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2986)|
| 0:49:51| as a subset of all of the different locations that we previously studied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2991)|
| 0:49:56| As you see in the information before you, we took a present value perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=2996)|
| 0:50:01| on what is the cost of occupying a similar number of square feet in each of these different locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3001)|
| 0:50:10| First, if we went into the AJ building, we renovated that building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3010)|
| 0:50:15| brought the systems up to code and up to standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3015)|
| 0:50:21| The net cost of that would be $49,708,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3021)|
| 0:50:27| We understand that's an asset at the conclusion of a similar period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3027)|
| 0:50:32| that we're comparing to the TVA East Tower lease of 20 years, the base period plus five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3032)|
| 0:50:40| We said that we expect that building at that point in time to have a residual value of about $10 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3040)|
| 0:50:48| of $39,708,000 and some change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3048)|
| 0:50:52| For the TVA East Tower, we've looked at the cost of occupancy, the lease cost, the renovation cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3052)|
| 0:51:00| and also considered the residual value of that property in the future at $15 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3060)|
| 0:51:10| related to the garage and its associated space for a negative net cost of a little over $4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3070)|
| 0:51:20| As Matt described, we took a look at Rural High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3080)|
| 0:51:26| If we just went in and built about 106,000 square feet brand new program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3086)|
| 0:51:31| to exactly what the school board needs, the school system needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3091)|
| 0:51:36| that cost along with the associated furniture and the occupancy of that space for a 20-year period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3096)|
| 0:51:43| would be a little over $48,670,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3103)|
| 0:51:48| We again estimated the residual value of that building at the end of that 20-year period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3108)|
| 0:51:56| at $15 million for a net cost of $33,670,000 and some change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3116)|
| 0:52:04| And then we also looked at the SunTrust building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3124)|
| 0:52:08| We would have to add square footage to that existing footprint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3128)|
| 0:52:12| to get it up to that same comparable 106,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3132)|
| 0:52:17| and we would have to add parking to that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3137)|
| 0:52:20| For that addition, that renovation, that parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3140)|
| 0:52:24| that would be at a cost of $41 million and just under $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3144)|
| 0:52:30| Again, a perspective of what is the value of that in 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3150)|
| 0:52:34| we estimated that at $15 million for a net cost of $26 million and just under $500,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3154)|
| 0:52:43| as a comparison of these four particular options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3163)|
| 0:52:47| I think it's back to Chris now. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3167)|
| 0:53:01| At this time, I would like to introduce the CEO of the Knoxville Chamber, Mike Odom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3181)|
| 0:53:05| to come and say a few words about this next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3185)|
| 0:53:13| Good evening. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Commission, Commissioner Buehler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3193)|
| 0:53:17| Go Tigers. The real ones, combatant readers, not the other ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3197)|
| 0:53:21| So I just wanted to come up here and be brief because I do want to get home and watch the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3201)|
| 0:53:27| Our board has been evaluating this situation for a few months now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3207)|
| 0:53:31| and last week decided to take a position that we are in support of this move for a couple of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3211)|
| 0:53:36| One is the economic impact of maintaining KCS's administrative support team downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3216)|
| 0:53:45| That has an economic impact of about $71 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3225)|
| 0:53:49| and that does not include relocating the UT System staff members to the heart of downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3229)|
| 0:53:57| The other part is to take the AJA building and get it back into a commercial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3237)|
| 0:54:02| That economic impact, based on the numbers that we've seen, is about $69 million annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3242)|
| 0:54:08| So those reasons, as well as if I could add one personal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3248)|
| 0:54:13| is to get KCS's team into a building that is much more reflective of the important work they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3253)|
| 0:54:21| It means a lot for our ability to be able to attract and retain talent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3261)|
| 0:54:26| So because of those different factors, our board decided to support this proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3266)|
| 0:54:33| and I'm happy to answer any questions at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3273)|
| 0:54:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3276)|
| 0:54:43| Now I'd like to introduce Jane Burrett, the CEO of Public Building Authority, to discuss the quality of space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3283)|
| 0:54:56| Thank you. Good evening. I'm Jane Burrett, as Chris had said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3296)|
| 0:55:00| I wanted to talk to you about some specifics about the space itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3300)|
| 0:55:04| George said it much more eloquently than I could say, so I'll try and be brief on that period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3304)|
| 0:55:11| But the AJA is a beautiful facility. But it is dated. It's historic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3311)|
| 0:55:15| It's used for other things, such as a hotel and that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3315)|
| 0:55:18| So to renovate that space, one of my concerns is if the school stays there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3318)|
| 0:55:23| where do we put them while we're renovating that space?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3323)|
| 0:55:27| Because there are definitely deferred maintenance items that need to be addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3327)|
| 0:55:30| and we will have to consider in this where they could be moved, the cost of moving them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3330)|
| 0:55:36| and in addition to that, just the disruption of their daily business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3336)|
| 0:55:41| Throughout the years, the several years we've worked on this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3341)|
| 0:55:45| they looked at big vanilla box buildings as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3345)|
| 0:55:49| Those seem like a good solution many times for a call center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3349)|
| 0:55:53| They are very expensive to redesign for an office space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3353)|
| 0:55:58| I mean, they're built for retail, for fluorescent lighting, large ceilings, minimal restrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3358)|
| 0:56:04| And so when you have to come in and revamp those to be something of an office space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3364)|
| 0:56:09| the cost is almost astronomical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3369)|
| 0:56:11| So those were eliminated many times because of the cost or the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3371)|
| 0:56:16| The TVA Tower is an office space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3376)|
| 0:56:19| When you go in there, there are things to be done, things we'd like to do, but basically it's ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3379)|
| 0:56:25| It's a Class B space, where today the Andrew Johnson Building is a Class C space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3385)|
| 0:56:30| So the amenities are there. It's much nicer, much better environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3390)|
| 0:56:34| We'd like to do an open floor plan for the employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3394)|
| 0:56:37| because after programming that seemed to be a good option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3397)|
| 0:56:40| basically because of the classic windows, views, and the daylight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3400)|
| 0:56:45| that all employees would then have the ability to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3405)|
| 0:56:48| If we talk about ADA accessibility in parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3408)|
| 0:56:53| from Dwight Kessel to the Andrew Johnson Building, it's .01 miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3413)|
| 0:56:59| It is exactly three minutes for myself and KGIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3419)|
| 0:57:04| If you go from the Summer Place Garage to the front of the TVA East Tower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3424)|
| 0:57:10| it is .01 miles, and it says it takes two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3430)|
| 0:57:14| It took me about two and a half minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3434)|
| 0:57:17| If you were in a wheelchair, there is a switchback at the TVA Tower that will assist you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3437)|
| 0:57:24| There is also, in the handout that you see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3444)|
| 0:57:27| there will be an ADA entrance built on the Fritz Lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3447)|
| 0:57:32| That will have an elevator in it, a button that can be pushed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3452)|
| 0:57:36| and it will also have ADA parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3456)|
| 0:57:39| So if a visitor to the site is coming with a disability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3459)|
| 0:57:42| they can push the button and get entry into the building via that elevator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3462)|
| 0:57:47| which will be a good asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3467)|
| 0:57:49| The Summit Hill side of the building meets ADA code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3469)|
| 0:57:53| TVA is currently working on some enhancements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3473)|
| 0:57:57| and they hope to, with this new initiative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3477)|
| 0:58:02| make the transition from TVA Towers to Market Square a much easier access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3482)|
| 0:58:07| In doing so, the ADA would again be addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3487)|
| 0:58:10| and probably better accommodations than we even have today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3490)|
| 0:58:15| You've already looked at the rendering, so my apology on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3495)|
| 0:58:21| When two floors were added to the State Street Garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3501)|
| 0:58:26| we moved 550 parkers from there over to Summer Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3506)|
| 0:58:31| Basically it was because we didn't have any place for these people to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3511)|
| 0:58:34| so we worked out a lease with TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3514)|
| 0:58:37| At first, I will tell you, we thought it was going to be totally problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3517)|
| 0:58:41| What are we going to do? This is not going to make people happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3521)|
| 0:58:43| But people did actually enjoy the space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3523)|
| 0:58:46| It's an older garage, but they felt secure because of the activity downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3526)|
| 0:58:52| And also, we have security nearby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3532)|
| 0:58:55| Our Market Square Garage, we have an officer in there full-time daily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3535)|
| 0:58:59| We also have all the on-street enforcement downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3539)|
| 0:59:02| So our officers, as they're patrolling the streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3542)|
| 0:59:05| they come back and go through the garages on an hourly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3545)|
| 0:59:08| So security there I don't think will be a factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3548)|
| 0:59:12| We would add cameras and have security from our officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3552)|
| 0:59:15| as we do elsewhere on all the parking that we manage today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3555)|
| 0:59:18| And we do manage all the city and county public garages and parking lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3558)|
| 0:59:22| with the exception of the Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3562)|
| 0:59:25| As we look at parking in general, because we manage all those sites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3565)|
| 0:59:32| I would tell you, Summer Place, as everybody else has said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3572)|
| 0:59:35| is the gem of the deal in managing garages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3575)|
| 0:59:40| And as George has said, those rebuilding costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3580)|
| 0:59:43| remodel costs is about $19,500 per space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3583)|
| 0:59:49| So at a minimum, that garage is worth $15 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3589)|
| 0:59:53| And that does not include your office space or your storage space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3593)|
| 0:59:57| And the revenue stream there is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3597)|
| 1:00:00| You've got Market Square across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3600)|
| 1:00:02| They're paying $85 a space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3602)|
| 1:00:04| Langley, $115.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| We will have the accommodations to make for UT and the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3606)|
| 1:00:10| so that they don't have to pay an exorbitant rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3610)|
| 1:00:13| They'll have the same parking rate that they do today and good accommodations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3613)|
| 1:00:20| As far as security in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3620)|
| 1:00:22| I would like to just say I've met with the TVA security team many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3622)|
| 1:00:27| We have over 100 facilities that we manage for the city and county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3627)|
| 1:00:31| and I am rarely asked to reduce security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3631)|
| 1:00:34| So I think in this day and age, to have added security is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3634)|
| 1:00:39| I do realize that the federal guidelines are difficult,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3639)|
| 1:00:42| but I will tell you they've made it as easy as they can for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3642)|
| 1:00:47| And we wanted PVA to be the ones in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3647)|
| 1:00:50| So they've had to convince me, I think, more than anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3650)|
| 1:00:53| But if you have a badge, as you do today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3653)|
| 1:00:57| PVA is going to assign those badges, and we do that from the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3657)|
| 1:01:01| I mean, if the school tells us it's a new employee or someone that frequents the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3661)|
| 1:01:05| and they want them to have access, we will provide a badge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3665)|
| 1:01:08| So you simply walk in, swipe your card, and you're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3668)|
| 1:01:11| If you're someone that's a visitor and you do not have your driver's license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3671)|
| 1:01:16| or when Real ID comes into play, you don't have your Real ID license or a passport,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3676)|
| 1:01:21| on that other sheet that you've got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3681)|
| 1:01:24| the two areas that are to the left and to the right of the entrance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3684)|
| 1:01:28| and the entrance would be the area with two entry points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3688)|
| 1:01:31| those areas are set aside as reserved meeting space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3691)|
| 1:01:35| So the individuals can be escorted there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3695)|
| 1:01:38| We will contact the person that you've come to see or department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3698)|
| 1:01:41| and they can come down and meet you in the lobby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3701)|
| 1:01:44| So if you don't have the requirements that we need to get you in a federal building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3704)|
| 1:01:49| we do have a way to accommodate your services there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3709)|
| 1:01:53| We will, bear with me one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3713)|
| 1:01:57| I met actually with school board officials and a school board member last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3717)|
| 1:02:02| that did want to see increased enhanced security in the AJ building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3722)|
| 1:02:06| We were going to add the magnometer, which is the scanner that you walk through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3726)|
| 1:02:10| but the costs were higher and they decided because of the move, let's wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3730)|
| 1:02:15| So we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3735)|
| 1:02:17| We do hold all the school board meetings at the city county building here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3737)|
| 1:02:21| And we have gone through all of our calendars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3741)|
| 1:02:24| and even after the move, we'll continue to do that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3744)|
| 1:02:28| So that's not going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3748)|
| 1:02:31| And I feel as though the time that I've spent with security, with TVA Towers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3751)|
| 1:02:35| they're cooperative, they're good partners, they want to make this work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3755)|
| 1:02:39| and I think in time there's a few adjustments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| but we'll have a more secure environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3761)|
| 1:02:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3763)|
| 1:02:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3771)|
| 1:02:56| I'd like to talk just a moment about the potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3776)|
| 1:03:01| I don't know which one I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3781)|
| 1:03:03| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3783)|
| 1:03:05| The potential sale for the AJ building that we have as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3785)|
| 1:03:11| It was offered for sale by RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3791)|
| 1:03:14| We requested mixed use and got actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3794)|
| 1:03:19| the second RFP that we've done for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3799)|
| 1:03:22| We had seven respondents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3802)|
| 1:03:24| They were from Knoxville, Nashville, Memphis, Columbus, Ohio, and Indianapolis, Indiana.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3804)|
| 1:03:31| The AJ building, the highest dollar figure that we got for that was $6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3811)|
| 1:03:37| That was from BNA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3817)|
| 1:03:39| The next highest was 5.3, and then we dropped to 5.1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3819)|
| 1:03:45| AJ building, the footprint of the building is .635 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3825)|
| 1:03:51| It was built in 1927 through 29.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3831)|
| 1:03:55| It's 147,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3835)|
| 1:03:58| and the developer is planning a complete renovation of the entire structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3838)|
| 1:04:03| This is very expensive due to its age and the condition that the building's in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3843)|
| 1:04:11| The Supreme Court site, they received $2.6 million for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3851)|
| 1:04:17| Its footprint is 1.97 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3857)|
| 1:04:20| It was built in 52 and 53.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3860)|
| 1:04:22| The building is actually 53,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3862)|
| 1:04:26| and they plan on demolishing all but one courtroom of that building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3866)|
| 1:04:30| so a much cheaper option to demolish and build new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3870)|
| 1:04:34| than to renovate something that's almost 100 years old now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3874)|
| 1:04:40| The developer most likely will seek some type of tax assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3880)|
| 1:04:44| We're not sure what that's going to be yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3884)|
| 1:04:46| but we'll still see the hotel motel and sales tax from this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3886)|
| 1:04:51| so that is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3891)|
| 1:04:53| The development agreement will be negotiated and presented to commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3893)|
| 1:04:58| and the final decision on the sale of the AJ building is obviously the county commission's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3898)|
| 1:05:04| Keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3904)|
| 1:05:07| If you don't like the sale, you don't have to approve their agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3907)|
| 1:05:11| I will tell you, though, before I turn it back over to Mayor Jacobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3911)|
| 1:05:14| we will be deferring the sale of the AJ building to the February agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3914)|
| 1:05:21| as we want the two transactions to be separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3921)|
| 1:05:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3925)|
| 1:05:36| I would first like to thank everybody who put this presentation together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3936)|
| 1:05:43| as well as all the work that has gone into this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3943)|
| 1:05:48| It has been significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3948)|
| 1:05:52| I hope and I would think that all along no one thought this came across my desk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3952)|
| 1:05:59| and I'm like, hey, that sounds like a good deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3959)|
| 1:06:01| Let's just rent the TVA building and move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3961)|
| 1:06:04| This has been an extremely long process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3964)|
| 1:06:09| When I first came into office September before last, TVA was not on my radar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3969)|
| 1:06:16| It just wasn't feasible to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3976)|
| 1:06:19| At that time, they were proposing renting the space at $5 per square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3979)|
| 1:06:25| We weren't interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3985)|
| 1:06:27| Couldn't make it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3987)|
| 1:06:29| TVA contacted us and said we would like to talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3989)|
| 1:06:33| And essentially said, what would it take for this deal to work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3993)|
| 1:06:39| So this is what we laid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=3999)|
| 1:06:43| First year, 37.5 cents per square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4003)|
| 1:06:46| Summer building at this price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4006)|
| 1:06:48| All this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4008)|
| 1:06:50| Thought right there that we had a done deal we could just write a contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4010)|
| 1:06:54| and get it over with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4014)|
| 1:06:57| Supposed to come to commission, I think, winter of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4017)|
| 1:07:02| Because we found out that there were issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4022)|
| 1:07:05| We couldn't just do a lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4025)|
| 1:07:07| We couldn't just do this or that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4027)|
| 1:07:09| The law director's department had some very valid concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4029)|
| 1:07:13| I'd like to thank the law director for looking out for the best interests of the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4033)|
| 1:07:17| Thank you very much for what you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4037)|
| 1:07:19| Because it caused us to do a very deep dive into all of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4039)|
| 1:07:25| and to employ and contract and to use some of the very best people in this area in their expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4045)|
| 1:07:32| Mark Mametoff is one of the best real estate and the best tax lawyers around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4052)|
| 1:07:38| Folks from Partners Development as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4058)|
| 1:07:45| So we have done a tremendous amount of due diligence on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4065)|
| 1:07:52| I believe that it is a once-in-a-generation opportunity for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4072)|
| 1:07:59| Is there still risk despite everything that we've done to ensure the protection of Knox County and our taxpayers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4079)|
| 1:08:05| Yes, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4085)|
| 1:08:06| There's always risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4086)|
| 1:08:08| There's risk in anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4088)|
| 1:08:10| But there's also risk to maintaining the status quo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4090)|
| 1:08:15| There's a saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4095)|
| 1:08:17| Nothing is more expensive than a missed opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4097)|
| 1:08:22| And I would hate to see Knox County miss this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4102)|
| 1:08:27| So at this point, the presentation is over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4107)|
| 1:08:32| We'll answer any questions that you all have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4112)|
| 1:08:35| And going forward, if you have any more questions or any concerns that occur to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4115)|
| 1:08:40| please feel free to reach out to me, my office, Mr. Caldwell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4120)|
| 1:08:45| or any of the folks that have presented here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4125)|
| 1:08:48| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4128)|
| 1:08:50| Thank you, Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4130)|
| 1:08:51| I'm sure my fellow commissioners will have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4131)|
| 1:08:53| I will do my best to respond and call on everybody in accordance with Robert's Rules of Orders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4133)|
| 1:08:58| So the first round of questions will just sort of go in order of the lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4138)|
| 1:09:02| And then if you have a second question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4142)|
| 1:09:04| and there's another person who has not asked a question yet and their light comes on, I'll be recognizing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4144)|
| 1:09:09| So first, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4149)|
| 1:09:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4152)|
| 1:09:13| Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4153)|
| 1:09:16| It was mentioned in the presentation that there is income from the digital crossing occupancy of Summer Place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4156)|
| 1:09:24| and the short-term lease back, I think, for two years to TVA while they relocate some people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4164)|
| 1:09:31| Do you have the income numbers on both those or rough estimates of what those income numbers are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4171)|
| 1:09:38| The number for digital crossings is $230,000 annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4178)|
| 1:09:44| What was your second question? I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4184)|
| 1:09:46| I noticed in a section about TVA there was a short-term lease back of some space in Summer Place for about two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4186)|
| 1:09:53| while they relocate or do some, I can't remember what it's for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4193)|
| 1:09:58| So that's part of the reduced cost to the 1.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4198)|
| 1:10:01| Okay, so that's built in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4201)|
| 1:10:02| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4202)|
| 1:10:03| Is the digital crossing income to Knox County of $230,000 built into the estimates or is that sort of a?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4203)|
| 1:10:11| We included it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4211)|
| 1:10:12| That is included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4212)|
| 1:10:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4213)|
| 1:10:14| Thank you very much for the clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4214)|
| 1:10:16| Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4216)|
| 1:10:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4217)|
| 1:10:18| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4218)|
| 1:10:21| Any additional questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4221)|
| 1:10:24| Yes, Commissioner Bessler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4224)|
| 1:10:27| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4227)|
| 1:10:29| A couple of things that kind of got me what we were talking about here and some words that came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4229)|
| 1:10:35| The words are very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4235)|
| 1:10:38| We were looking at one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4238)|
| 1:10:42| I think it was under a couple of people or one of them said, under this scenario, this works very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4242)|
| 1:10:51| And I'm not sure what that scenario was or what they were explaining to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4251)|
| 1:10:56| But UT wants to rent this space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4256)|
| 1:11:02| Let's see, is it David Miller, the one that would be wanting to rent this space?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4262)|
| 1:11:13| He's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4273)|
| 1:11:16| Mr. Miller had to leave for another engagement, but UT would be subleasing under the proposal several floors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4276)|
| 1:11:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4283)|
| 1:11:24| Well, let me ask you this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4284)|
| 1:11:27| Knox County is going to be signing that 210-page document here that talks about the easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4287)|
| 1:11:34| If we changed, say we're subleasing to you and we just change the name on this to sublease that top six floors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4294)|
| 1:11:44| and put Knox County on there, would you all sign this lease?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4304)|
| 1:11:47| We haven't begun negotiating directly with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4307)|
| 1:11:51| We've had a number of conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4311)|
| 1:11:53| But, yes, we're comfortable signing a document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4313)|
| 1:11:56| But you would sign this lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4316)|
| 1:11:58| And the question would be, then, if you would sign this document, why doesn't UT go ahead and sign and lease it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4318)|
| 1:12:03| and we would sublease from you all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4323)|
| 1:12:07| I'll let you speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4327)|
| 1:12:10| Chris, let me address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4330)|
| 1:12:17| Commissioner, it's basic math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4337)|
| 1:12:19| We would be renting from TVA for $0.375 per square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4339)|
| 1:12:24| We would be then selling space to UT for $1 per square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4344)|
| 1:12:29| There's a $0.625 profit for Knox County in that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4349)|
| 1:12:34| So I believe that would behoove Knox County to take advantage of it, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4354)|
| 1:12:39| I understand the math that you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4359)|
| 1:12:42| I'm just saying it looks like the county and the taxpayers of Knox County is paying for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4362)|
| 1:12:50| We talked about employees parking, but we didn't talk about any of the people that are paying the taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4370)|
| 1:12:59| What's wrong with our system here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4379)|
| 1:13:03| Well, sir, the taxpayers get the benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4383)|
| 1:13:07| And then also I believe that we are going to allow free parking in the garage after hours like we do here at the city and county building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4387)|
| 1:13:15| as well as other garages around the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4395)|
| 1:13:19| But that's the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4399)|
| 1:13:21| Taxpayers are paying for the building and they want to come and visit their schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4401)|
| 1:13:25| Why would we go ahead and charge them to park to come to see their own schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4405)|
| 1:13:30| We do that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4410)|
| 1:13:31| And why would we limit them to say, okay, you can only visit this part of the mezzanine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4411)|
| 1:13:36| Sir, we do that now, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4416)|
| 1:13:39| I know you do it now, but what about when we go to the TVA building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4419)|
| 1:13:43| There's no difference. Nothing changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4423)|
| 1:13:45| So they can go up to any floor they want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4425)|
| 1:13:47| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4427)|
| 1:13:50| From what I understand here, you have to have a special ID to get into a federal building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4430)|
| 1:13:56| Right now, if they go across the street to the AJ building, do they have to have a special ID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4436)|
| 1:14:03| Well, sir, I would contend that if they go over to the AJ building, there's still security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4443)|
| 1:14:07| and they're probably just not going to be able to run up to any floor of the AJ building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4447)|
| 1:14:13| If I can talk without this thing roaring again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4453)|
| 1:14:19| What's going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4459)|
| 1:14:20| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4460)|
| 1:14:22| Move your mic, Bussler. Move your mic over a little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4462)|
| 1:14:25| In that respect, sir, nothing changes. Everything's the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4465)|
| 1:14:29| Okay, but they don't have to have a special ID to go in the AJ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4469)|
| 1:14:34| A person can come down and escort them back up to the offices that they want to go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4474)|
| 1:14:38| And here they would be escorted to a space where they would be able to have a meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4478)|
| 1:14:43| but they can't go into private offices in the AJ building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4483)|
| 1:14:47| Can they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4487)|
| 1:14:49| I would assume that they're just not going to walk into Superintendent Thomas' office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4489)|
| 1:14:53| But they can visit any person on any floor that they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4493)|
| 1:14:58| No, sir, they can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4498)|
| 1:15:00| They can't come to this building and just walk into everybody's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4500)|
| 1:15:07| I'm not talking about walking in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4507)|
| 1:15:10| What I'm talking about in a federal building, when I went to federal buildings in Washington,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4510)|
| 1:15:14| I was limited to spaces, and even though I was visiting my congressman and I had ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4514)|
| 1:15:21| we had to be escorted to his office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4521)|
| 1:15:24| And then, sir, what will happen here is there is a special place for someone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4524)|
| 1:15:28| if you do not have the real ID, to where someone can come down and meet with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4528)|
| 1:15:32| I mean, and it's going to be the same thing in Washington, D.C., very soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4532)|
| 1:15:35| Maybe we can talk before this thing starts roaring again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4535)|
| 1:15:38| Maybe we just need to talk around this mic some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4538)|
| 1:15:42| But all I'm saying is we're renting space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4542)|
| 1:15:47| and now we're limiting the taxpayers' access to their school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4547)|
| 1:15:52| because they have to have a special ID to get in a federal building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4552)|
| 1:15:57| Commissioner Busler, we will make arrangements so that someone can come down and meet with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4557)|
| 1:16:05| And, again, what you're saying is you're comparing apples to oranges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4565)|
| 1:16:08| They do not have absolute access currently to the A.J. building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4568)|
| 1:16:15| I'm talking about the ID, the special ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4575)|
| 1:16:17| I am talking about access to the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4577)|
| 1:16:19| It makes no difference about the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4579)|
| 1:16:24| Okay, so they don't have to have a special ID to get into the federal building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4584)|
| 1:16:28| just like they do at the A.J. building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4588)|
| 1:16:30| At the A.J. building, whether you have a normal ID, it doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4590)|
| 1:16:34| UPS, you could go up to certain spots in the A.J. building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4594)|
| 1:16:37| You're not just going to be able to walk into anybody's office there, no matter what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4597)|
| 1:16:41| No, sir, what we're talking about at TVA is we will make arrangements that do not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4601)|
| 1:16:46| for folks that do not have possession of the real ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4606)|
| 1:16:50| which is essentially the same thing that's happening now at the A.J. building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4610)|
| 1:16:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4615)|
| 1:16:56| And in October, in October, you're going to have to have a real ID to fly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4616)|
| 1:17:02| You're going to have to have a real ID to enter a federal building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4622)|
| 1:17:06| So that's going to be a transition that takes place anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4626)|
| 1:17:09| This is probably a short-term situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4629)|
| 1:17:11| We've got people in Oxcan who are going to fly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4631)|
| 1:17:13| I'm just talking about getting in their own buildings that they're paying for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4633)|
| 1:17:17| I'm just looking out for the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4637)|
| 1:17:20| I am, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4640)|
| 1:17:22| And what I'm asking you and talking to you about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4642)|
| 1:17:28| one of the big things that bothers me, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4648)|
| 1:17:30| is their access and our sovereignty to our taxpayers to visit their schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4650)|
| 1:17:37| And it looks like we're giving away some of that sovereignty to get into that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4657)|
| 1:17:43| Well, Commissioner Bussler, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4663)|
| 1:17:45| they cannot just walk right into the A.J. building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4665)|
| 1:17:48| and walk anywhere in that building where they go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4668)|
| 1:17:50| whether they have a passport, a real ID, a driver's license, or anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4670)|
| 1:17:55| That's the way security works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4675)|
| 1:17:59| When they come in this building, do they have to have that special ID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4679)|
| 1:18:02| No, they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4682)|
| 1:18:04| But, again, they're not going to be able to just walk into anyone's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4684)|
| 1:18:10| We will make arrangements so that they are able to perform whatever they need to perform there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4690)|
| 1:18:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4695)|
| 1:18:21| The other thing that was talked to also was I asked about the lease here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4701)|
| 1:18:27| and I don't think that you have a lease with the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4707)|
| 1:18:30| You're still negotiating with it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4710)|
| 1:18:32| So we don't know if they're going to lease it or not, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4712)|
| 1:18:35| I think they pretty much said today that they're ready to sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4715)|
| 1:18:39| Once we get an agreement, they're ready to sublease for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4719)|
| 1:18:43| Will they sign the same kind of lease that we're signing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4723)|
| 1:18:46| Yes, they have no issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4726)|
| 1:18:49| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4729)|
| 1:18:52| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4732)|
| 1:18:53| Commissioner Gill, then Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4733)|
| 1:18:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4735)|
| 1:18:57| I have some questions to clarify some language on Exhibit A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4737)|
| 1:19:04| My first question involves how much is the cost of the chill water service agreement between TVA and the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4744)|
| 1:19:11| Do we know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4751)|
| 1:19:14| There's no cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4754)|
| 1:19:15| Okay, there's no cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4755)|
| 1:19:17| And the second question under the exhibits that I have a question about is TVA will provide security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4757)|
| 1:19:26| and PBA will be doing our security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4766)|
| 1:19:28| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4768)|
| 1:19:30| TVA will be hiring their security for people to come into the building to provide the checks and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4770)|
| 1:19:39| What Jane was saying is the PBA will be doing all the badging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4779)|
| 1:19:43| So, in other words, you would go to PBA for their badging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4783)|
| 1:19:45| But the on-site physical security day-to-day will be provided by the TVA security team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4785)|
| 1:19:51| And they're there 24 hours because they're right across the way in the West Tower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4791)|
| 1:19:55| and so they'll be coordinating it with the West Tower activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4795)|
| 1:19:58| What the security services agreement is is where they provide the officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4798)|
| 1:20:01| and the personnel to provide the same level of security that they do for the West Tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4801)|
| 1:20:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4805)|
| 1:20:06| And we have on question number five, or statement number five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4806)|
| 1:20:09| is the assignment and assumption agreement relating to existing licenses and leases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4809)|
| 1:20:16| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4816)|
| 1:20:17| See, the language now transfers to easement versus leasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4817)|
| 1:20:21| Which one is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4821)|
| 1:20:22| Because specifically in this question, it identifies it as a lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4822)|
| 1:20:26| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4826)|
| 1:20:27| The digital crossing is a lease because it is directly with TVA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4827)|
| 1:20:30| but because our real property interests will be effectively ownership, as I've talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4830)|
| 1:20:36| a permanent easement that are transferring that lease to us so that we'll get the income from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4836)|
| 1:20:40| It is right now characterized as a lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4840)|
| 1:20:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4843)|
| 1:20:44| As Mr. Stinett described, though, our relationship with UT would be basically a sub-easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4844)|
| 1:20:50| Not basically, it would be a sub-easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4850)|
| 1:20:51| but the existing lease on the property in favor of digital crossing would be assigned to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4851)|
| 1:20:56| And TVA recognizes that we will effectively step in as the landlord and get the income from that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4856)|
| 1:21:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4862)|
| 1:21:03| Because the way it's written, it is the local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4863)|
| 1:21:05| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4865)|
| 1:21:06| It is confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4866)|
| 1:21:07| It is confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4867)|
| 1:21:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4868)|
| 1:21:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4869)|
| 1:21:10| And could you speak to the, because I think you touched on the issue of liability insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4870)|
| 1:21:15| that we're having to increase the cost associated with that, which would be what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4875)|
| 1:21:21| That's been an issue that has delayed us quite a bit in being able to get here is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4881)|
| 1:21:29| I know you all know this, but just to make it clear for the audience, is that Knox County has sovereign immunity, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4889)|
| 1:21:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4894)|
| 1:21:35| So there's slips and falls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4895)|
| 1:21:36| You have, under what's called the GTLA, the Government Total Liability Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4896)|
| 1:21:42| have waived your liability to a certain limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4902)|
| 1:21:46| Obviously, we have Randy here who's an expert in this area, so he can correct me if I misstate anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4906)|
| 1:21:50| But, again, this has been a really important point to the law director and to his office is that we do not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4910)|
| 1:21:57| in other words, if there's a slip and fall in the building, that we're not indemnifying TBA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4917)|
| 1:22:02| and it's taken us a long, long time to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4922)|
| 1:22:04| So we suggested that they ask us to get insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4924)|
| 1:22:08| We don't normally carry insurance for that sort of thing because we have sovereign immunity, right, and so we don't need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4928)|
| 1:22:14| So we went back and forth, and we tried to get some quotes for some insurance, and we were being moderately successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4934)|
| 1:22:20| But we realized that the risk is really for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4940)|
| 1:22:23| We don't have very much risk because of sovereign immunity, so they decided we'll buy the insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4943)|
| 1:22:28| and we'll just reimburse them for that cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4948)|
| 1:22:30| So that's how the current drafts are working is that we have no indemnity obligation to them for that type of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4950)|
| 1:22:37| but they're just going to acquire their own insurance, and we'll reimburse them for the premium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4957)|
| 1:22:41| just to solve that problem that took several months to get through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4961)|
| 1:22:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4965)|
| 1:22:48| Do I read the resolution correctly to indicate that what is the time frame associated with this sale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4968)|
| 1:22:56| Because what occurs is it will never come back to Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4976)|
| 1:22:59| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4979)|
| 1:23:01| So if we come to you on the 27th and you all approve this, we will run final title reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4981)|
| 1:23:12| and make sure that we, just like if you're buying a home or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4992)|
| 1:23:16| you want to make sure nobody put a lean down at the last minute sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4996)|
| 1:23:19| and that's why that resolution is worded that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=4999)|
| 1:23:21| So we'll double check the title and make sure there's no problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5001)|
| 1:23:25| I would expect that we'd be in a position to close within a relatively short time after Commissioner approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5005)|
| 1:23:31| I know UT is very, very anxious to us to sit down and negotiate, as Commissioner Bussler asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5011)|
| 1:23:37| basically a set of easement identical to what we have for the upper six floors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5017)|
| 1:23:43| And so I'm sure the law director is over there not laughing at me, but laughing with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5023)|
| 1:23:52| that I never can predict how long it takes to get things done with TVA, usually double what I estimate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5032)|
| 1:23:57| but I don't think it will take very long to move if you all choose to approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5037)|
| 1:24:04| I'm talking about weeks. I certainly won't be the next day or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5044)|
| 1:24:07| Right, right. I'm just looking at the language in this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5047)|
| 1:24:10| because it is different from other resolutions in terms of its language with this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5050)|
| 1:24:17| But I'm curious as to why some of the language in the actual resolution is executed not through this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5057)|
| 1:24:26| but through the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5066)|
| 1:24:29| You know, this is something we try to limit any – the mayor has really no discretion in terms of negotiating the economic terms of the transaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5069)|
| 1:24:37| Why there is a number of references to giving latitude to the mayor's office is to be able to do the final title searches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5077)|
| 1:24:43| to be able to fill in the dates for the closing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5083)|
| 1:24:46| For example, the two-year license back to TVA, it will start on that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5086)|
| 1:24:50| So I can't fill in that date until we actually close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5090)|
| 1:24:54| It doesn't give him the latitude to renegotiate any of the economics of the transaction or any of the substance of the transaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5094)|
| 1:25:00| It basically is like what a private entity would do with a board resolution, would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5100)|
| 1:25:06| look, we approve these documents, we approve the substantial terms of the documents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5106)|
| 1:25:11| and Mr. Mayor, you're given the authority to sort of clean up little items as necessary to get this closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5111)|
| 1:25:17| but you can't go renegotiate the deal. You do not have that latitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5117)|
| 1:25:21| Okay. And then the Knox County's agreement with the school board, MOU would have to be signed first or after we execute this resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5121)|
| 1:25:31| Well, Mayor's very clear, at least to me, is that obviously he wants the school board to approve this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5131)|
| 1:25:39| and that's critical that if the schools don't want to go, that's – we don't want – the administration is not looking for some sort of dispute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5139)|
| 1:25:48| So I know the school board actually meets fairly early this month. I think they meet, I think, on the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5148)|
| 1:25:53| I think they can certainly settle me if I'm wrong, but it was before this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5153)|
| 1:25:58| But we certainly are prepared to go whenever the school board is ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5158)|
| 1:26:04| I mean, I think there's obviously some representation from the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5164)|
| 1:26:07| They've heard a lot of this information, but I think they want to understand why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5167)|
| 1:26:11| Why do we feel like this is the best deal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5171)|
| 1:26:14| And so we certainly will go back over the economics with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5174)|
| 1:26:17| And there certainly will not be any closing before we went through in front of the school board and got their blessing with a revised MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5177)|
| 1:26:23| As the law director and I have talked about, the version – my friend Chris Caldwell and the finance director for the schools are excellent finance people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5183)|
| 1:26:32| but maybe they should leave the legal work to the law director's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5192)|
| 1:26:36| And I'm kidding to some extent, but they based that – the MOU that was drafted was not – the lawyers really weren't involved in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5196)|
| 1:26:43| And so I've been giving Chris a hard time asking if maybe we could help a little bit with it when we go back and clarify some issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5203)|
| 1:26:49| So, yes, I definitely would go back to the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5209)|
| 1:26:52| And I think that's what they voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5212)|
| 1:26:53| We talked about bringing it to them at their next meeting, which was – I think, again, is in a couple of days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5213)|
| 1:26:58| And so we needed to go – come here tonight and get our ducks in a row,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5218)|
| 1:27:03| and then we'll certainly be going back to them with an amended MOU for their consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5223)|
| 1:27:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5227)|
| 1:27:09| Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5229)|
| 1:27:10| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5230)|
| 1:27:12| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5232)|
| 1:27:13| I have a question for Jane from PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5233)|
| 1:27:23| Hello, Jane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5243)|
| 1:27:24| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5244)|
| 1:27:25| Currently, when a member of the public comes to the AHA building, they have to show a driver's license to get access, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5245)|
| 1:27:32| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5252)|
| 1:27:34| I'm not completely familiar with the – what's the new license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5254)|
| 1:27:39| Real ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5259)|
| 1:27:40| Real ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5260)|
| 1:27:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5261)|
| 1:27:42| But I believe anybody that has a license will be able to get a real ID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5262)|
| 1:27:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5265)|
| 1:27:46| There are some steps you take when you go in to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5266)|
| 1:27:48| You need a passport or you need your birth certificate, things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5268)|
| 1:27:51| but things that you can produce to get the real ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5271)|
| 1:27:54| And then by October of 2020, that will go into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5274)|
| 1:27:59| Today at the Andrew Johnson building, you show your driver's license and we print out a badge for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5279)|
| 1:28:06| Then we contact the individual on the floor and make sure it's okay that you come up, that you had a meeting scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5286)|
| 1:28:13| If not, they will come down to you, which is what similar we will have in this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5293)|
| 1:28:19| You do have to still walk through a scanner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5299)|
| 1:28:22| But same premise, that if you can't – if you come in and you don't have your ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5302)|
| 1:28:27| we're going to move you to one of those rooms, contact the person you came to see, and ask them to come down and meet with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5307)|
| 1:28:34| Currently in the AJ building, PVA has some offices. Verizon has a floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5314)|
| 1:28:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5319)|
| 1:28:40| And Knox County Probation is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5320)|
| 1:28:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5322)|
| 1:28:43| Now, on any given day, what is the average number of citizens that come just to see the school administration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5323)|
| 1:28:52| On average, we have 9 to 12 individuals a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5332)|
| 1:28:55| There are times of the year when there's specific things going on that that might increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5335)|
| 1:28:59| but we went over the averages and that was 9 to 12 individuals a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5339)|
| 1:29:03| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5343)|
| 1:29:04| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5344)|
| 1:29:07| Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5347)|
| 1:29:08| Yes, I'd like to take a moment to get somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5348)|
| 1:29:11| I feel like this directly impacts more than most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5351)|
| 1:29:13| I'd like to hear Superintendent Thomas' viewpoint on this, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5353)|
| 1:29:17| And then I have other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5357)|
| 1:29:19| Super Bob, you have the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5359)|
| 1:29:34| Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission, Commissioner Biggs, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5374)|
| 1:29:39| My opinion on this from the standpoint of where we were initially to where we are today, I support this move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5379)|
| 1:29:46| This is going to provide with us an opportunity to redirect approximately a million dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5386)|
| 1:29:52| then our budget to other educational needs, student support type of activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5392)|
| 1:29:58| So I do support for that reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5398)|
| 1:30:01| And over a 15-year period, this roughly means roughly $16 million to the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5401)|
| 1:30:06| and over a 40-year period would be roughly $60 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5406)|
| 1:30:10| So based on what I said initially, as the Commission were to pay for the move,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5410)|
| 1:30:17| then I certainly support that and we'll make it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5417)|
| 1:30:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5421)|
| 1:30:22| I just knew through this entire process it's been a little, you know, a little bumpy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5422)|
| 1:30:27| so I just wanted to get your viewpoint so we could publicly say that, you know, we've got your viewpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5427)|
| 1:30:32| And since that point, too, I know Mayor Jacobs has been very instrumental in working with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5432)|
| 1:30:40| and also Mr. Caldwell and Matt with purchasing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5440)|
| 1:30:44| so we appreciate all the cooperation there and willing to listen to what we feel like our needs are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5444)|
| 1:30:53| and to make some adjustments so that those needs can be fulfilled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5453)|
| 1:30:58| So I do know that ultimately the decision rests with the County Commission and also with the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5458)|
| 1:31:03| but just from my personal standpoint, I support this move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5463)|
| 1:31:09| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5469)|
| 1:31:10| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5470)|
| 1:31:11| My next question is, when I was reviewing the contracts, there was some talk about a service elevator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5471)|
| 1:31:18| Can somebody give me a little bit of an update on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5478)|
| 1:31:26| It may be, Jane, but there will be an elevator constructed in the Fritz lot, sort of like an L-shape,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5486)|
| 1:31:32| that you will be able to park in the Fritz lot, and if you need ADA access, you'll be able to take that elevator up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5492)|
| 1:31:38| The security guards will be able to meet you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5498)|
| 1:31:40| They'll see that that elevator, they'll know that somebody is coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5500)|
| 1:31:43| They'll go meet them, screen the person there at the elevator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5503)|
| 1:31:45| So the ultimate ADA access to the TVA East Tower will be substantially better than any present access to the AJ building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5505)|
| 1:31:53| I mean, you'll basically be able to park next to an elevator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5513)|
| 1:31:56| Now, of course, the Fritz lot is not exactly Westtown Mall parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5516)|
| 1:32:00| but there certainly will be some ADA accessible spaces there that folks with disabilities can get directly into the East Tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5520)|
| 1:32:07| The reason I was asking that is because it was stated earlier about the metal detectors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5527)|
| 1:32:12| and things of that nature that are located there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5532)|
| 1:32:14| So if we do have that entrance at the rear, which it seems like it's already under construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5534)|
| 1:32:20| are we going to have to implement a metal detector there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5540)|
| 1:32:22| Will that fall on us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5542)|
| 1:32:23| Will that fall on TVA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5543)|
| 1:32:24| It's not under construction unless you all approve it, because TVA, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5544)|
| 1:32:27| if you all decide not to pursue this, then they may look at alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5547)|
| 1:32:30| And so that would be part of our leasehold improvements to construct that service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5550)|
| 1:32:34| They totally redid the elevators in the building up and down, which is a very significant cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5554)|
| 1:32:39| But this would be our expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5559)|
| 1:32:41| And my understanding, and Jane, please correct me if I misstated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5561)|
| 1:32:44| is that if someone comes up to them, they actually would be escorted through the normal thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5564)|
| 1:32:49| so you would not have to double staff the thing, given the relatively small number of visitors to the thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5569)|
| 1:32:55| that it would not make sense to provide separate staffing, and they'll be able to meet them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5575)|
| 1:33:00| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5580)|
| 1:33:01| She's a lot better than I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5581)|
| 1:33:02| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5582)|
| 1:33:03| And Commissioner Riggs, I think you might refrain to the freight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5583)|
| 1:33:06| Anything coming into the building as a parcel or mail will be scanning at Summer Place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5586)|
| 1:33:11| and this will be an activity that PBA would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5591)|
| 1:33:14| We've already purchased a mail scanner in this equation, and it's one that TVA uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5594)|
| 1:33:20| So all of that will be processed over there and brought to this entrance and come into the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5600)|
| 1:33:25| so it meets federal standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5605)|
| 1:33:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5606)|
| 1:33:27| I'm not sure if that answers your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5607)|
| 1:33:28| No, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5608)|
| 1:33:29| And then my next question for Director Caldwell, can you show me in the A.J. contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5609)|
| 1:33:35| or just direct me to what page because I was looking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5615)|
| 1:33:39| what happens if B&A buys the A.J. building and then it sells it the next day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5619)|
| 1:33:49| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5629)|
| 1:33:50| I'm not going to get in for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5630)|
| 1:33:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5631)|
| 1:33:52| You're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5632)|
| 1:33:53| That's the document you don't have, to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5633)|
| 1:33:55| That's the development agreement, and Commissioner Schoonmaker asked me the same question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5635)|
| 1:34:00| We were chatting at an event not too long ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5640)|
| 1:34:03| So it's really important to understand there's two different documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5643)|
| 1:34:06| There's the basic vanilla purchase and sale agreement that's been on your agenda a couple times for $6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5646)|
| 1:34:11| And great, $6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5651)|
| 1:34:13| It sounds okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5653)|
| 1:34:14| Whether that's the highest and best use, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5654)|
| 1:34:17| Because it was asked to be mixed use, it may have depressed the price a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5657)|
| 1:34:21| but we're trying to create some sales tax revenues and hotel multi-tax revenues for the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5661)|
| 1:34:26| But, again, you can vote that down at the next meeting if you still think it's the right price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5666)|
| 1:34:32| But even if you do decide it's the right price, the next thing will be the development agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5672)|
| 1:34:36| That development agreement, of which I have worked on many,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5676)|
| 1:34:39| and I know that Mr. Caldwell asked me to work with the law department on this if they'll bide my time a little bit longer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5679)|
| 1:34:45| is you really tie the developer down in that document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5685)|
| 1:34:48| No flipping, you know, reversionary rights back to the county if they don't do what they say they do within a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5688)|
| 1:34:57| As I think Mr. Lyons is here, I helped him negotiate for almost a year and a half probably on the Supreme Court side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5697)|
| 1:35:04| for exactly those same issues, that we're going to get what we bargained for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5704)|
| 1:35:07| and if we don't, we're going to get the property back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5707)|
| 1:35:09| And so after it's in substantial construction, then at that point we no longer have the reversionary rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5709)|
| 1:35:16| at least on the Supreme Court, but it's a good example of what you can do to make sure you protect the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5716)|
| 1:35:20| that the developer is going to give you what you said you're going to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5720)|
| 1:35:23| Thank you. I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5723)|
| 1:35:26| Good question. Now, Mr. Bates, you get there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5726)|
| 1:35:29| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5729)|
| 1:35:30| All right. Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5730)|
| 1:35:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5732)|
| 1:35:33| Mr. Caldwell, in the presentation that you made to us today in the documents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5733)|
| 1:35:43| and unfortunately they're not numbered here, but anyways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5743)|
| 1:35:46| you said that the University of Tennessee was agreeable to leasing 105,000 square feet at $1 a square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5746)|
| 1:35:56| In your document here, though, you're showing that UT's face net revenue is only $65,000 and change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5756)|
| 1:36:03| What's the other $40,000 reduction in rent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5763)|
| 1:36:07| There are 37.5 cents a square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5767)|
| 1:36:09| So I didn't show a gross number, I showed a net number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5769)|
| 1:36:12| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5772)|
| 1:36:13| And then on the square footage that we're going to have from the lobby through the sixth floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5773)|
| 1:36:20| how much of that is actually office space in square footage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5780)|
| 1:36:33| $100,000, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5793)|
| 1:36:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5795)|
| 1:36:36| Because what we have on the plaza level is all meeting space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5796)|
| 1:36:42| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5802)|
| 1:36:46| And then, let's see, let me jump to another comment was made, and I don't know if you can answer it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5806)|
| 1:36:53| but the TVA General Counsel, my understanding, they were going to have a letter or a document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5813)|
| 1:37:00| saying that they approve all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5820)|
| 1:37:04| Is that what they said, and do we have receipt of that, or is that en route?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5824)|
| 1:37:12| The quick answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5832)|
| 1:37:16| Often when you do a large transaction like this, both sides give legal opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5836)|
| 1:37:21| We're not being asked to give one here, but because of the unique nature of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5841)|
| 1:37:24| neither us nor the law director are being asked to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5844)|
| 1:37:27| But because of the unique nature of the easements, the law director suggested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5847)|
| 1:37:31| which again was a very good idea, to make sure that we got legal assurances from TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5851)|
| 1:37:36| So you'll get an opinion from the General Counsel's office, signed by the General Counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5856)|
| 1:37:40| saying that these easements have been legally authorized, they're duly enforceable against TVA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5860)|
| 1:37:46| the sort of standard legal opinion that you would get in a large corporate transaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5866)|
| 1:37:52| And so, yes, we're going to get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5872)|
| 1:37:54| Have we seen a draft? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5874)|
| 1:37:56| The law director had some comments, I had some comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5876)|
| 1:37:58| We're waiting to get a revised draft back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5878)|
| 1:38:00| They're working on it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5880)|
| 1:38:01| Hopefully we hope to have a draft for you that we can share with you at the meeting on the 27th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5881)|
| 1:38:06| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5886)|
| 1:38:07| And then I guess my next question is for Matt Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5887)|
| 1:38:20| Good evening, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5900)|
| 1:38:21| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5901)|
| 1:38:22| It's my understanding that we've allocated $25,000 to move the employees' personal items out of the AJA building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5902)|
| 1:38:32| over to the new towers, and that all of the desks, chairs, floor mats, workstations, commuters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5912)|
| 1:38:39| file cabinets, all of that will be left there, and I'm assuming it will be your responsibility to sell that on GovDeals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5919)|
| 1:38:46| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5926)|
| 1:38:47| And on equipment like that, what do you normally get a percentage of actual price?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5927)|
| 1:38:55| Do you get $0.10 on the dollar, $0.05 on the dollar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5935)|
| 1:38:59| I would hope to get $0.10 or $0.15 on the dollar, because they'll be responsible for moving it, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5939)|
| 1:39:03| So, you know, it's not like it's sitting in my warehouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5943)|
| 1:39:06| It's an easy upload to a truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5946)|
| 1:39:09| Okay, so they would actually purchase it in place and be responsible for clearing it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5949)|
| 1:39:13| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5953)|
| 1:39:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5954)|
| 1:39:15| And then in some of these documents, they've characterized that the new desks, chairs, file cabinets, workstations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5955)|
| 1:39:22| computer stands, all that peripheral stuff is $5 million, and would that be owned by Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5962)|
| 1:39:29| or would that be gifted over to Knox County Schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5969)|
| 1:39:33| I'll have to defer to MFF&E Furniture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5973)|
| 1:39:39| I guess by the contract, it would be to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5979)|
| 1:39:44| Now, as we go through programming, if there's anything that we feel could be used and the schools have interest in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5984)|
| 1:39:55| for sure we would work with them and work through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5995)|
| 1:39:59| Okay, but we would maintain ownership of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=5999)|
| 1:40:06| Are you talking about the furniture that's in TVA or which furniture are you talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6006)|
| 1:40:10| Yeah, all the new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6010)|
| 1:40:12| Commissioner Smith said, are you referring to all the new office desks, chairs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6012)|
| 1:40:15| That's what I'm referring to, yes, the $5 million worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6015)|
| 1:40:18| Okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6018)|
| 1:40:19| And then I guess my last question is, these are the documents that we have in hand that are supposedly the contracts for us to review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6019)|
| 1:40:32| In order to save a bunch of trees, if there are revisions to these, can you just send those with the page number and what the revisions are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6032)|
| 1:40:39| so all of us don't have to have all of this reprinted again and then have to re-read this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6039)|
| 1:40:47| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6047)|
| 1:40:49| Commissioner Scobie, I assume you have the last drafts that were posted of all the easements and all things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6049)|
| 1:40:53| Is that what you're looking at there? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6053)|
| 1:40:55| So, yes, is the quick answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6055)|
| 1:40:59| There are updated drafts to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6059)|
| 1:41:02| I would suggest we post and send out to you all the current drafts of all the documents with the exhibits enclosed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6062)|
| 1:41:09| I'm down personally to just two or three minor comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6069)|
| 1:41:13| Charlie and I haven't had a chance to chat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6073)|
| 1:41:16| I've been traveling quite a bit, and so he may have a few additional comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6076)|
| 1:41:19| But I do think any additional changes will be fairly minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6079)|
| 1:41:22| And so if you guys are okay with it, we will go ahead and send out the current drafts, which do have all the exhibits inserted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6082)|
| 1:41:28| I know you all have expressed concerns about blanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6088)|
| 1:41:30| In my judgment, the only blanks left in are blanks left to dates and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6090)|
| 1:41:35| which, as Commissioner Gill asked about, will be determined by closing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6095)|
| 1:41:39| And then once we post those out, we would just send around redlined pages to show any changes after that to save trees and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6099)|
| 1:41:46| if that's okay with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6106)|
| 1:41:48| And then my last question is just so that folks watching on TV understand this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6108)|
| 1:41:53| that we would be purchasing the Summer Place Towers garage and what did you actually call that, the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6113)|
| 1:42:02| I keep calling it Summer Place Complex, but they call it three different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6122)|
| 1:42:05| Right, for the $1.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6125)|
| 1:42:08| But what we're actually purchasing is all of the structures above the ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6128)|
| 1:42:12| that we are not purchasing the ground underneath,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6132)|
| 1:42:15| that we would own all of the concrete, all of the windows, everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6135)|
| 1:42:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6139)|
| 1:42:20| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6140)|
| 1:42:21| I just want to make sure, because some people don't understand when you say purchase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6141)|
| 1:42:23| they think you're purchasing lock, stock, and barrel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6143)|
| 1:42:26| And I know you know this, but it's also important to note that at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6146)|
| 1:42:30| TVA is waiving any rights to use the ground, in other words, they can't use mineral rights and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6150)|
| 1:42:34| so they can't interfere with our use of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6154)|
| 1:42:36| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6156)|
| 1:42:37| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6157)|
| 1:42:39| Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6159)|
| 1:42:41| We're back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6161)|
| 1:42:42| We've got a few commissioners that have questions that have already asked questions before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6162)|
| 1:42:45| I've got a very basic question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6165)|
| 1:42:46| I want to be clear that I'm asking this question more for the general public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6166)|
| 1:42:50| or folks who might be watching at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6170)|
| 1:42:54| I was lucky enough to have a finance degree from the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6174)|
| 1:42:58| but for some folks who don't, you know, one of the terms that we've used very commonly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6178)|
| 1:43:02| as we're evaluating this deal is the concept of net present value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6182)|
| 1:43:08| Harry, do you want to take this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6188)|
| 1:43:11| But what I'd like to do, because one of the slides in here illustrated the present value, residual value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6191)|
| 1:43:18| I'd like to ask either Chris or Mark or Harry or someone for the benefit of the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6198)|
| 1:43:24| to kind of give a very brief description of what exactly does net present value mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6204)|
| 1:43:34| So, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6214)|
| 1:43:36| So if you built a new building at Rule, you would have to, say, borrow $30 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6216)|
| 1:43:40| I'm making that number up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6220)|
| 1:43:41| And you're going to have to issue bonds, which is great for me as a bond lawyer, but not great for you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6221)|
| 1:43:46| And so then you have interest on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6226)|
| 1:43:48| So assume the interest rate is 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6228)|
| 1:43:50| The present value of that is still $30 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6230)|
| 1:43:53| So you basically look at an income stream over a period of time and take a snapshot today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6233)|
| 1:43:58| Well, if you do the same thing for the rent to TVA, you look at the rent to TVA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6238)|
| 1:44:02| and the operating expenses each year and say that adds up to $30 million over the life of the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6242)|
| 1:44:07| But that's $30 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6247)|
| 1:44:08| Some of it's not payable to 20 years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6248)|
| 1:44:11| A million dollars payable 20 years from now is only, say, worth $400,000 today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6251)|
| 1:44:15| So to do apples and oranges, we took a snapshot of every, our best estimate by year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6255)|
| 1:44:21| of what would be paid in present value at the county's bond rate to today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6261)|
| 1:44:26| So that chart that was handed out to you, as well as what's shown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6266)|
| 1:44:29| it represents a snapshot of today at present value at 3%, which is a little bit above your bond rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6269)|
| 1:44:34| We try to be conservative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6274)|
| 1:44:36| So you're comparing apples and apples so that the numbers, the cost of each of the facilities are the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6276)|
| 1:44:43| The hardest estimate, and a number of you have asked me about this from time to time, is to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6283)|
| 1:44:47| you know what, I don't like to lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6287)|
| 1:44:48| I want to buy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6288)|
| 1:44:49| But I think what you'll find and what we're trying to show to you today is we're effectively buying Summer Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6289)|
| 1:44:54| We're going to get really good value out of that, number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6294)|
| 1:44:57| Number two, the lease rate is so good that it makes up for any not having a residual interest, number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6297)|
| 1:45:03| And number three, we have the right to stay at the TVA Tower for 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6303)|
| 1:45:06| That would be the entire useful life of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6306)|
| 1:45:09| So even though it's not a purchase, you basically have the legal right to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6309)|
| 1:45:13| Most real estate people, and I'm sure George would confirm, is that a 40-year right to use a piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6313)|
| 1:45:18| you basically at that point in time would have to totally renovate it or tear it down at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6318)|
| 1:45:22| So we're trying to give you a snapshot today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6322)|
| 1:45:24| The only reason we picked 20 years is at 20 years, that's the easiest point to sell Summer Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6324)|
| 1:45:30| After all the fiber license and stuff to go, then we could sell Summer Place fairly easily if you chose to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6330)|
| 1:45:36| and recognize the value of a 700 space garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6336)|
| 1:45:40| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6340)|
| 1:45:42| Yeah, that helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6342)|
| 1:45:43| I mean, what I would say, the flip side of what I describe present value would be, like, if you're an individual and you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6343)|
| 1:45:50| let's just say you had a rental property, and if I was trying to buy a rental property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6350)|
| 1:45:55| and I knew that I had a tenant that was going to stay in there for 20 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6355)|
| 1:46:00| and I knew what the rent was going to be in the escalators, how much would I pay for it today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6360)|
| 1:46:05| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6365)|
| 1:46:07| Or how much would also a bank lend me the money to pay for it if they did a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6367)|
| 1:46:11| or if we hired a fancy real estate appraiser to say this is what it's worth today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6371)|
| 1:46:15| So that's, in a way, I guess I wanted you to say that rather than me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6375)|
| 1:46:19| I could try, but see, the lawyer answered the question, so the finance guy answered the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6379)|
| 1:46:24| You did it more succinctly, but yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6384)|
| 1:46:26| I mean, I talk about it in bonds, but exactly what you described is what is an income stream worth today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6386)|
| 1:46:30| from a rental apartment or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6390)|
| 1:46:32| That's the value of that rental stream today, or the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6392)|
| 1:46:35| Adding in that there are also fixed hard costs, too, that you factor into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6395)|
| 1:46:39| Okay, all right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6399)|
| 1:46:40| Now, the key issue is how much you discounted, Hugh, and I know you know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6400)|
| 1:46:42| We used 3 percent because we felt that was the borrowing cost for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6402)|
| 1:46:46| Very good. All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6406)|
| 1:46:48| Next, going in order, I believe, Commissioner Busler, and then we'll have Gil, and then back to Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6408)|
| 1:46:56| Okay. These should be pretty yes or no questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6416)|
| 1:47:03| I want to use another mic, Charlie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6423)|
| 1:47:08| Maybe it's just the way I'm maybe talking into this mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6428)|
| 1:47:14| But TVA pays about $4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6434)|
| 1:47:19| It's just you, Charlie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6439)|
| 1:47:22| TVA pays about $4 million a year in like a TIF or a pilot program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6442)|
| 1:47:28| What's he wearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6448)|
| 1:47:30| Will that be affected with us renting that building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6450)|
| 1:47:34| Charlie, I'm going to restate your question because I was able to hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6454)|
| 1:47:37| I think your question, as I heard it, was something about TVA and a pilot or a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6457)|
| 1:47:42| If TVA is paying right now about $4 million a year to Knox County in either a TIF or a pilot program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6462)|
| 1:47:50| will that amount be affected with us renting just one part of that building over there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6470)|
| 1:47:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6476)|
| 1:47:57| It will not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6477)|
| 1:47:58| No. Their pilot is based off the waterways. It's not based off those buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6478)|
| 1:48:04| Okay. That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6484)|
| 1:48:06| Also in here, it says in our book here that we've got, it says TVA will not pay any brokerage or realtor fees in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6486)|
| 1:48:15| Are there any brokerages or realtors that's working on this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6495)|
| 1:48:23| If there are, I mean, I've sat through a zillion meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6503)|
| 1:48:26| There are no brokerage fees. If there are, I'll be shocked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6506)|
| 1:48:29| Nobody making any money on the side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6509)|
| 1:48:31| Other than me, I'm getting paid by the hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6511)|
| 1:48:35| We'll work a little bit longer before the LSU game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6515)|
| 1:48:38| Maybe you'll make a few more to buy your dinner tonight with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6518)|
| 1:48:49| I wish I had this in front of me right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6529)|
| 1:49:01| Let me ask you this question here, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6541)|
| 1:49:03| This goes back to this one that's kind of bothered me since we've started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6543)|
| 1:49:08| This is on page eight, item number C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6548)|
| 1:49:11| It says within 60 days after the expiration of the physical year, falling entirely or partly within the term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6551)|
| 1:49:20| TVA shall submit an operating expense reconciliation showing the O&M.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6560)|
| 1:49:26| Now with them remodeling and doing some other things to that building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6566)|
| 1:49:30| will that not raise their expenses to where we would be paying more for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6570)|
| 1:49:35| No, that's not in the O&M costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6575)|
| 1:49:37| And so O&M is operations, so it's utilities, it's maintenance work that they would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6577)|
| 1:49:42| It's not the work that they're doing currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6582)|
| 1:49:44| And actually, with the HVAC work they're doing, they probably could lower it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6584)|
| 1:49:49| So what you're saying, for the next 15 years, there would not be any increases in those operating costs, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6589)|
| 1:49:55| What we will do, not project-based, ultimately, you know, we may internally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6595)|
| 1:50:02| if KUB were to raise rates over that period of time, we may want to raise what our estimate is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6602)|
| 1:50:07| But as far as increases from the TVA standpoint, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6607)|
| 1:50:13| It's just a pass-through and it's based off a percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6613)|
| 1:50:15| Because that's kind of strange, KUB raising TVA rates, which TVA sells that to KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6615)|
| 1:50:23| That's kind of strange, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6623)|
| 1:50:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6624)|
| 1:50:25| But anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6625)|
| 1:50:26| Ironic, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6626)|
| 1:50:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6627)|
| 1:50:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6628)|
| 1:50:29| Thank you, Commissioner Bessler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6629)|
| 1:50:30| Are you good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6630)|
| 1:50:31| Yes, I'm good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6631)|
| 1:50:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6632)|
| 1:50:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6633)|
| 1:50:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6634)|
| 1:50:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6635)|
| 1:50:36| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6636)|
| 1:50:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6637)|
| 1:50:38| This question, and I have one for the schools and one regarding the sale of the AJ building to B&I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6638)|
| 1:50:45| Did I understand this correctly, that they are seeking to have, before the sale is complete, a TIF associated with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6645)|
| 1:50:59| Commissioner Gill, they definitely are going to ask for some sort of incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6659)|
| 1:51:03| So far, they've asked for a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6663)|
| 1:51:05| And so this is going to make for a really interesting discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6665)|
| 1:51:09| I know I've boarded you guys with pilots and TIFs before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6669)|
| 1:51:12| and this is going to be a really interesting one because they would like a long-term pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6672)|
| 1:51:16| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6676)|
| 1:51:17| I hope that you will—I know you guys, you're great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6677)|
| 1:51:20| You will think very thoughtfully about how long you give and what's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6680)|
| 1:51:25| And that's one reason, as again I emphasized in one of the slides that I worked on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6685)|
| 1:51:29| was that the ultimate benefit of the county will largely be dependent on the amount of the incentive that was given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6689)|
| 1:51:35| I know that the city has worked very hard to try to only give pilots incentives where it's really needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6695)|
| 1:51:41| and I know you all will look at that really hard and spend some time on the numbers to decide what's really needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6701)|
| 1:51:46| And I think that's where the really hard negotiating is going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6706)|
| 1:51:49| is what type of incentive you guys approve for that transaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6709)|
| 1:51:53| I think you should expect that anyone, because of how historical and old that building is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6713)|
| 1:51:57| how expensive, there will be some type of incentive that will be requested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6717)|
| 1:52:00| and then you're going to have to weigh that against the purchase price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6720)|
| 1:52:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6724)|
| 1:52:05| And my second question goes to the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6725)|
| 1:52:09| Because we have indicated that there's a million dollars in savings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6729)|
| 1:52:13| and that that would support student support needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6733)|
| 1:52:17| is that existing programmatic needs or are we speaking of new personnel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6737)|
| 1:52:22| What I would envision, and again it all depends on the revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6742)|
| 1:52:27| and we've talked so much about the mental, emotional, social issues that students are having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6747)|
| 1:52:34| and being able to provide the resources in the way of personnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6754)|
| 1:52:38| or either the contract for those resources to make sure that we're finding ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6758)|
| 1:52:43| to address those mental, social, and emotional needs of students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6763)|
| 1:52:47| Because, again, I'm hearing that from our teachers and also from our school administrators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6767)|
| 1:52:52| It's a real issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6772)|
| 1:52:55| So if we could use that money to address those issues, that would be the preference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6775)|
| 1:53:00| Again, it would be up to the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6780)|
| 1:53:02| You know, when they approve the budget to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6782)|
| 1:53:05| But that's initially what my thoughts are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6785)|
| 1:53:07| And is the entire administrative function moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6787)|
| 1:53:10| or will there be an opportunity for personnel to be moved to support specific schools in each district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6790)|
| 1:53:18| I think as we look at the data and look at the discipline data and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6798)|
| 1:53:23| probably, again, whether we contract that or we hire personnel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6803)|
| 1:53:27| I would envision, again, that it would be people with special training backgrounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6807)|
| 1:53:32| and so forth to help address those issues more so than people that are already on staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6812)|
| 1:53:37| Although we have some folks on staff that are very confident in doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6817)|
| 1:53:41| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6821)|
| 1:53:42| Is all of the administrative support function existing at AJ moving if the body says?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6822)|
| 1:53:48| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6828)|
| 1:53:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6829)|
| 1:53:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6830)|
| 1:53:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6831)|
| 1:53:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6832)|
| 1:53:53| Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6833)|
| 1:53:54| You're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6834)|
| 1:53:55| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6835)|
| 1:53:56| Commissioner Smith, then Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6836)|
| 1:53:58| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6838)|
| 1:53:59| Superintendent Thomas, will it be your recommendation to the Board of Education to move to the East Tower?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6839)|
| 1:54:06| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6846)|
| 1:54:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6847)|
| 1:54:08| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6848)|
| 1:54:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6849)|
| 1:54:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6850)|
| 1:54:11| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6851)|
| 1:54:12| Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6852)|
| 1:54:13| Oh, you had a follow-up question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6853)|
| 1:54:15| You're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6855)|
| 1:54:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6856)|
| 1:54:17| Not for you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6857)|
| 1:54:18| Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6858)|
| 1:54:21| If the Board of Education chooses to go against the superintendent's recommendation to move to the East Tower and surplus the AJ building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6861)|
| 1:54:32| do we have an occupancy programming schedule for other county offices to occupy that space?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6872)|
| 1:54:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6878)|
| 1:54:39| So while our number one option is to move schools to the East Tower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6879)|
| 1:54:45| assuming we get everything worked out with custody and control and the AG's opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6885)|
| 1:54:51| we do have a plan B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6891)|
| 1:54:55| And a plan B is something that Chief Hare and myself have worked on with PBA that would move offices in this building to the East Tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6895)|
| 1:55:08| So we really prefer, of course, to move schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6908)|
| 1:55:13| And then we'd like to do that long-term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6913)|
| 1:55:16| That's phase one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6916)|
| 1:55:18| Phase two for us has always been, with the purchase of Summer Place, the ability to sell Knox Central, get it back on the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6918)|
| 1:55:27| We've had some conversations about centralizing school maintenance in one location, getting some other properties back on the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6927)|
| 1:55:36| And so we've got a long-term vision as it relates to this move, and this move is only phase one, which is what we're discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6936)|
| 1:55:45| But if things do not work out with schools and the Board of Education chose not to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6945)|
| 1:55:52| or we don't get a legal ruling like we anticipate, this deal isn't contingent on the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6952)|
| 1:56:01| We would look to move county offices to the East Tower because it's such a good deal we don't feel like we can pass it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6961)|
| 1:56:09| The next question is Jane from PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6969)|
| 1:56:18| Jane, what is the operation and maintenance cost per square foot in this building currently to the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6978)|
| 1:56:23| This building is $9.35 a square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6983)|
| 1:56:27| Okay, so even if we moved offices out of here, as long as the city occupied the spaces that were vacated, this would be a net gain, even if the county had to move there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6987)|
| 1:56:37| Yes. This building is 100% occupied, and we get calls daily for additional space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=6997)|
| 1:56:42| It is a lease between PBA, the city, and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7002)|
| 1:56:47| So that space has to be incorporated to one or the other, but there are needs in both areas for additional space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7007)|
| 1:56:55| A question about the A.J. building. I'm not sure Matt, Mark, Chris, who would be able to answer this question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7015)|
| 1:57:03| but people have questioned the $6 million price tag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7023)|
| 1:57:07| I believe that Matt said that the Supreme Court site was a $2.2 million appraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7027)|
| 1:57:14| Do we know what the Farragut sold for, which is a similar type conversion of an older building back to its original use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7034)|
| 1:57:26| The Farragut sold for $3.75 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7046)|
| 1:57:31| And just for comparison, I think Matt said that the A.J. building is 180,000 square feet, give or take, 140.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7051)|
| 1:57:40| The Farragut, I believe, is about 150,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7060)|
| 1:57:44| And so they sold for $3.75 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7064)|
| 1:57:47| And that's a couple of years ago, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7067)|
| 1:57:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7070)|
| 1:57:53| Thank you, Commissioner Smith. Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7073)|
| 1:58:00| Can I clarify that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7080)|
| 1:58:02| Yes, a clarifying question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7082)|
| 1:58:04| He was asking if it's comparable because the Farragut was in rough shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7084)|
| 1:58:09| Yes, it was in rough shape, but you're going to basically do the same thing to the A.J. building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7089)|
| 1:58:13| You strip everything on the inside, no matter what it's like, to convert it and remodel it back to a hotel use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7093)|
| 1:58:20| And so basically you're buying land and a structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7100)|
| 1:58:28| Thank you, Commissioner Smith. Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7108)|
| 1:58:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7111)|
| 1:58:33| This is for Superintendent Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7113)|
| 1:58:37| We've heard varying numbers on the amount of school system personnel that would move to the TVA towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7117)|
| 1:58:45| What is the count that would move to the TVA towers from the A.J. building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7125)|
| 1:58:51| I think in the Andrew Johnson building, there's roughly 235, 240 folks, I believe, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7131)|
| 1:59:04| Also, we've got our personnel in the CTE department that's located over at Lincoln Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7144)|
| 1:59:11| and I'm not sure exactly the number on that, maybe seven or eight folks or so that would now join us in the move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7151)|
| 1:59:20| so that they would be located with our curriculum and instruction folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7160)|
| 1:59:24| Okay, because we've heard numbers like 275 and all that, so around the 235, 240 range then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7164)|
| 1:59:31| I believe so in terms of the number of parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7171)|
| 1:59:37| Parking, they're counting for 300, but again, I think that's probably a little more than what we would need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7177)|
| 1:59:42| Those are rough numbers. I can get you exact numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7182)|
| 1:59:45| No, no, that's fine. Okay, that's perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7185)|
| 1:59:48| And then the next question is for Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7188)|
| 1:59:53| You probably should have just stayed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7193)|
| 1:59:56| The resolution that we received today that you prepared, these type documents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7196)|
| 2:00:02| is there usually some kind of expiration time period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7202)|
| 2:00:07| And the reason I bring that up, and this kind of goes to what Commissioner Gill was bringing up initially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7207)|
| 2:00:13| in some of the conversation, is we're actually, based on this document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7213)|
| 2:00:20| relinquishing some of our responsibilities as the legislative branch of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7220)|
| 2:00:25| and transferring those over to the executive branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7225)|
| 2:00:29| And while it is that you have this written for specific items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7229)|
| 2:00:36| but do other entities do some kind of a clause that on December 31, 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7236)|
| 2:00:43| this resolution is now null and void?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7243)|
| 2:00:46| Had you all thought about anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7246)|
| 2:00:48| That's a great question. The honest answer is we did not think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7248)|
| 2:00:51| I don't see that very often, but there is no reason that if you should so choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7251)|
| 2:00:57| I would suggest that if you want to put sort of a stale date in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7257)|
| 2:01:00| that you do it after the legislative session so that we can address any AG issues or legislative issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7260)|
| 2:01:06| But if we don't get this done essentially by the first of the summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7266)|
| 2:01:10| which I don't think it will take that long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7270)|
| 2:01:12| then certainly there's no reason why if you want to insert something that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7272)|
| 2:01:17| hey, you've got to come back to us if you don't get this closed by June 1 or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7277)|
| 2:01:21| that we couldn't do that. I mean, it's perfectly appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7281)|
| 2:01:24| That resolution actually was modeled after the one that you all approved on other leases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7284)|
| 2:01:31| for the energy savings stuff, to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7291)|
| 2:01:34| And so it's a similar form that what you use for a lot of sort of financing lease-type documents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7294)|
| 2:01:39| which is why I thought it was a good fit, because you had seen a similar resolution on the train stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7299)|
| 2:01:45| and things like that on those lease financings that were about to refinance and save you a boatload of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7305)|
| 2:01:51| So that's where that model came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7311)|
| 2:01:54| So that model just didn't have a stale date in it, but if you wanted to add one, there's no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7314)|
| 2:01:59| All right. Well, thank you. I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7319)|
| 2:02:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7321)|
| 2:02:03| Thank you, Mr. Schoonmaker. Back to you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7323)|
| 2:02:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7325)|
| 2:02:08| Forgive me. I think his light was on. I didn't see it a second ago, but you're due.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7328)|
| 2:02:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7332)|
| 2:02:13| Mr. Ramenthoff, getting your steps in here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7333)|
| 2:02:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7337)|
| 2:02:18| As a continuation to Commissioner Schoonmaker's question on the executive branch versus the legislative branch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7338)|
| 2:02:24| can you just clarify that, according to our charter, the mayor is sort of the sole responsibility of executing contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7344)|
| 2:02:32| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7352)|
| 2:02:33| Or is the chief executive officer, chief financial officer, and that's a normal role for them to sign off on contracts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7353)|
| 2:02:41| It certainly is a normal role to sign off on contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7361)|
| 2:02:43| I would say, though, it is county practice to not approve contracts that are not in substantially final form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7363)|
| 2:02:48| So that's certainly what we've been striving to get for you all and to give the mayor only such sort of things that are needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7368)|
| 2:02:55| to reflect when the closing occurs and not to, again, renegotiate the transaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7375)|
| 2:03:00| We certainly want the commission to fully understand the economics and the opportunity to vote for or against it based on the merits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7380)|
| 2:03:07| and not say, hey, this is the general thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7387)|
| 2:03:10| But I see various practices all over the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7390)|
| 2:03:13| Some county commissions give mayors lots of latitude to finalize agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7393)|
| 2:03:17| Some really want them buttoned up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7397)|
| 2:03:19| I really would say that's a matter of practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7399)|
| 2:03:21| And I certainly, again, I'm not trying to just be nice to the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7401)|
| 2:03:24| but he certainly would know a lot better than I would as to what level of finality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7404)|
| 2:03:28| But it is, again, very similar, as I said, to the lease purchase financings we did on the energy stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7408)|
| 2:03:34| Because, for example, there, until you close, you don't know what the effective interest rate in the lease is and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7414)|
| 2:03:39| And the same sort of things here is there are just certain things you cannot know until you're at the closing table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7419)|
| 2:03:44| and being able to fill in a few days and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7424)|
| 2:03:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7427)|
| 2:03:49| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7429)|
| 2:03:50| Back to you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7430)|
| 2:03:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7431)|
| 2:03:52| This is, I mean, I just, I'm trying to make sure I understand two pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7432)|
| 2:03:58| So we can, in effect, say custody and control issue has been resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7438)|
| 2:04:03| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7443)|
| 2:04:05| I would like to tell you that that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7445)|
| 2:04:07| But the custody and control issue, I would, and I think we all agree to this, is that it is really separate from the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7447)|
| 2:04:14| That was, I think, the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7454)|
| 2:04:15| That's where I'm going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7455)|
| 2:04:16| Yes, in terms of, I think, I don't know where the mayor went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7456)|
| 2:04:20| I want to make sure I can run if he doesn't disagree with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7460)|
| 2:04:22| But I think he's prepared to say that this is such a good deal that he would like to move ahead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7462)|
| 2:04:27| even if the school system doesn't agree to move into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7467)|
| 2:04:30| And, therefore, the custody and control issue would be moved because there would be no custody and control issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7470)|
| 2:04:37| because there would not be school system personnel in the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7477)|
| 2:04:40| As to the actual custody and control issue, you know, again, I've said this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7480)|
| 2:04:46| I respectfully don't believe it's a big problem, but I greatly respect the law director's views,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7486)|
| 2:04:51| and I want to make sure that we address them as best we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7491)|
| 2:04:55| And I think we're going to try to do that through an attorney general opinion and through legislation, if necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7495)|
| 2:05:00| So that can't, so it cannot fully be resolved until those issues, if the school system moves into them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7500)|
| 2:05:09| And I know the school system wanted comfort that those would not be issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7509)|
| 2:05:13| And as we put in the slide, there's no limitations on the day-to-day running of the schools in terms of decision-making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7513)|
| 2:05:20| There's the issue that Commissioner Bussler has raised that if someone visits the school, again, to be clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7520)|
| 2:05:25| if they have the adequate ID, they can go anywhere in the building just like the AJ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7525)|
| 2:05:29| If they don't have the real ID, they have to be on the bottom floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7529)|
| 2:05:33| That's a slight difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7533)|
| 2:05:34| And then there's the issue that if you're a security threat, a national security threat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7534)|
| 2:05:40| then you could be asked not to work in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7540)|
| 2:05:43| Those are the two big issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7543)|
| 2:05:45| And my final statement is the way this resolution is worded is that this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7545)|
| 2:05:53| once the resolution has been opposed or approved, moves the authorizing decision from the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7553)|
| 2:06:03| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7563)|
| 2:06:05| Because in times past, then any additional changes to contractual language would come back to the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7565)|
| 2:06:12| But at this point, we're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7572)|
| 2:06:13| I just need to make sure I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7573)|
| 2:06:15| Just to be absolutely clear, the answer to your question is yes, it would not come back to the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7575)|
| 2:06:21| But the sorts of things that the mayor has the right to change or approve are not substantive in my judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7581)|
| 2:06:26| They're things to implement the transaction that are very similar to other similar contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7586)|
| 2:06:31| that I've worked on for you all and for many municipalities across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7591)|
| 2:06:37| The meaningful decision making would fully be within this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7597)|
| 2:06:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7603)|
| 2:06:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7606)|
| 2:06:47| Any other questions from this body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7607)|
| 2:06:50| Well, I prepared to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7610)|
| 2:06:52| First of all, thank you for all of you for your patience here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7612)|
| 2:06:55| I know we've got a football game tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7615)|
| 2:06:58| I'm going to ask Mike Odom to stay after the meeting for 30 minutes to have some discussions about some business development through the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7618)|
| 2:07:06| But the meeting is officially closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7626)|
| 2:07:10| I'll wave to Gabel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7630)|
| 2:07:11| But also, after closure, if any commissioners would like to make any announcements about other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7631)|
| 2:07:16| we want to give everybody the right to make any announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7636)|
| 2:07:18| But as far as this discussion, it's closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7638)|
| 2:07:21| And I recognize each commissioner would like to make announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7641)|
| 2:07:26| Today is my mother's birthday, her 81st birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200113specialcalled?start=7646)|
