| 1:56:41| Seeing no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7001)|
| 1:56:43| seeming opposition, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7003)|
| 1:56:45| don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7005)|
| 1:56:47| I'll make a list and pull it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7007)|
| 1:56:49| I think the state just has to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7009)|
| 1:56:51| decide first what they're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7011)|
| 1:56:53| And then once that decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7013)|
| 1:56:55| is made, be involved with the Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7015)|
| 1:56:57| of Revenue, how they're going to structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7017)|
| 1:56:59| their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7019)|
| 1:57:01| allocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7021)|
| 1:57:03| Commissioner Smith and Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7023)|
| 1:57:05| On the sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7025)|
| 1:57:07| tax, that has huge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7027)|
| 1:57:09| implications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7029)|
| 1:57:11| It could affect future shopping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7031)|
| 1:57:13| online. And I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7033)|
| 1:57:15| worry that the state will worry about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7035)|
| 1:57:17| getting theirs and not worry about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7037)|
| 1:57:19| us getting ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7039)|
| 1:57:21| I think of these topics we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7041)|
| 1:57:23| got on local level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7043)|
| 1:57:25| just to keep it clean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7045)|
| 1:57:27| that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7047)|
| 1:57:29| go with increased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7049)|
| 1:57:31| BEP funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7051)|
| 1:57:33| Roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7053)|
| 1:57:35| I mentioned Tattle Pike, Washington| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7055)|
| 1:57:37| Pike, Pellissippi Parkway, North| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7057)|
| 1:57:39| Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7059)|
| 1:57:41| Growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7061)|
| 1:57:43| And a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7063)|
| 1:57:45| statement to them that we want our local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7065)|
| 1:57:47| sales tax distributed to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7067)|
| 1:57:49| point of sale of the home address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7069)|
| 1:57:51| of whoever purchases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7071)|
| 1:57:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7077)|
| 1:57:59| Those are all things I recall you brought up briefly at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7079)|
| 1:58:01| our work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7081)|
| 1:58:03| To summarize what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7083)|
| 1:58:05| you've said, and Commissioner Gill, I'll get to you in just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7085)|
| 1:58:07| a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7087)|
| 1:58:09| Local would be to increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7089)|
| 1:58:11| BEP funding for schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7091)|
| 1:58:13| Roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7093)|
| 1:58:15| the growth plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7095)|
| 1:58:17| which we've just talked about with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7097)|
| 1:58:19| Gerald Green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7099)|
| 1:58:21| and local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7101)|
| 1:58:23| sales tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7103)|
| 1:58:25| reimbursements track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7105)|
| 1:58:27| back to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7107)|
| 1:58:29| point of sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7109)|
| 1:58:31| For collection and distribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7111)|
| 1:58:33| That does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7113)|
| 1:58:35| sound like a very good local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7115)|
| 1:58:37| list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7117)|
| 1:58:39| Local legislative list for local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7119)|
| 1:58:41| items. The only other thing that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7121)|
| 1:58:43| might add on to that would be, once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7123)|
| 1:58:45| again, whereas we've just talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7125)|
| 1:58:47| the state wanting to get on board with what Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7127)|
| 1:58:49| Schoonmaker and I discussed would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7129)|
| 1:58:51| making sure that they do remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7131)|
| 1:58:53| on that with the local,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7133)|
| 1:58:55| yeah, I think you've got that clear on the local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7135)|
| 1:58:57| sales tax. All right. Go ahead, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7137)|
| 1:58:59| Thank you, Mr. Chair. And this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7139)|
| 1:59:01| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7141)|
| 1:59:03| think a comment for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7143)|
| 1:59:05| a later time. I think we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7145)|
| 1:59:07| had a very good legislative discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7147)|
| 1:59:09| but what I would like to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7149)|
| 1:59:11| is for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7151)|
| 1:59:13| county commissioner in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7153)|
| 1:59:15| each district to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7155)|
| 1:59:17| some of our larger priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7157)|
| 1:59:19| We come to our meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7159)|
| 1:59:21| but this county has larger priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7161)|
| 1:59:23| that we need to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7163)|
| 1:59:25| specific to each district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7165)|
| 1:59:27| so that they can be connected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7167)|
| 1:59:29| to the larger vision of what this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7169)|
| 1:59:31| county needs to look like. And I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7171)|
| 1:59:33| would just appreciate in the new year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7173)|
| 1:59:35| we identify those priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7175)|
| 1:59:37| so that we can begin to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7177)|
| 1:59:39| long-term how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7179)|
| 1:59:41| they are connected to each district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7181)|
| 1:59:43| and what they are so that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7183)|
| 1:59:45| can have a better handle on what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7185)|
| 1:59:47| those priorities need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7187)|
| 1:59:49| look like for a grand vision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7189)|
| 1:59:51| for this county. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7191)|
| 1:59:53| All right. And just a moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7193)|
| 1:59:55| I'm going to, I think we've been going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7195)|
| 1:59:57| pretty nonstop for the last two hours, so we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7197)|
| 1:59:59| have a five-minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7199)|
| 2:00:01| make it a ten-minute break and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7201)|
| 2:00:03| then come back. We have a fairly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7203)|
| 2:00:05| lean agenda for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7205)|
| 2:00:07| our zoning, and I do not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7207)|
| 2:00:09| frankly, I don't see many folks in the audience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7209)|
| 2:00:11| that might not be opposed, so I'd like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7211)|
| 2:00:13| put this meeting in recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7213)|
| 2:00:15| We'll go through, we'll take a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7215)|
| 2:00:17| ten-minute recess and then come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7217)|
| 2:00:19| to this to try and tie it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7219)|
| 2:00:21| briefly. If you ask Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7221)|
| 2:00:23| Skinmaker, you were, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7223)|
| 2:00:25| So, is there a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7225)|
| 2:00:27| to go to recess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7227)|
| 2:00:29| So moved. So moved by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7229)|
| 2:00:31| Commissioner Gill, is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7231)|
| 2:00:33| Second. All right, second by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7233)|
| 2:00:35| Commissioner Skinmaker. All right, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7235)|
| 2:00:37| are going to go into recess, take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7237)|
| 2:00:39| a brief break, and then we'll come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7239)|
| 2:00:41| and go through our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7241)|
| 2:00:43| zonings. All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7243)|
| 2:00:51| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7251)|
| 2:00:55| It's ten after seven, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7255)|
| 2:00:57| I'm calling to order the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7257)|
| 2:00:59| portion of this meeting of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7259)|
| 2:01:01| Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7261)|
| 2:01:03| We'll go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7263)|
| 2:01:05| and, Madam Clerk, do you want to do a quick roll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7265)|
| 2:01:07| Commissioner Gill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7267)|

| 2:01:29| tonight's agenda for us to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7289)|
| 2:01:31| For any of our guests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7291)|

| 2:01:39| zoning initiative will be given a spot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7299)|
| 2:01:41| to talk about it. If there's any person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7301)|
| 2:01:43| who's opposed to anything that we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7303)|
| 2:01:45| be discussing tonight, you will be given the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7305)|
| 2:01:47| opportunity to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7307)|

| 2:03:17| Commission felt that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7397)|
| 2:03:19| rezoning would allow development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7399)|

| 2:06:51| at a prior meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7611)|
| 2:06:53| And then the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7613)|
| 2:06:55| MPC action is adopt resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7615)|
| 2:06:57| 11-C-18| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7617)|

| 2:07:05| special district plan designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7625)|
| 2:07:07| and recommend that County Commission also adopt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7627)|
| 2:07:09| the sector plan. So Mr. Law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7629)|
| 2:07:11| Director, what is the absolute proper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7631)|
| 2:07:13| motion on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7633)|
| 2:07:15| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7635)|
| 2:07:17| this is one of the sector plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7637)|
| 2:07:19| that the MPC originally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7639)|
| 2:07:21| denied. The County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7641)|
| 2:07:23| initiated its own sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7643)|
| 2:07:25| That sector plan went back to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7645)|
| 2:07:27| Metropolitan Planning Commission for recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7647)|
| 2:07:29| What recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7649)|
| 2:07:31| the Metropolitan Planning Commission sent back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7651)|
| 2:07:33| is actually a different recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7653)|
| 2:07:35| than the one initiated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7655)|
| 2:07:37| by County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7657)|

| 2:07:47| mixed-use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7667)|
| 2:07:51| special district, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7671)|
| 2:07:53| a little bit different than high-density, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7673)|
| 2:07:55| permits the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7675)|
| 2:07:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7677)|
| 2:07:59| And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7679)|
| 2:08:03| under state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7683)|
| 2:08:05| the County Commission now has a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7685)|
| 2:08:07| of options. It can either approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7687)|
| 2:08:09| the high-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7689)|
| 2:08:11| zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7691)|
| 2:08:13| sector plan that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7693)|
| 2:08:15| initially initiated, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7695)|
| 2:08:17| it can approve the one that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7697)|
| 2:08:19| the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7699)|
| 2:08:21| has now recommended. Alright, that's my point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7701)|
| 2:08:23| because initially this came up and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7703)|
| 2:08:25| the resolution was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7705)|
| 2:08:27| originally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7707)|
| 2:08:29| Knox County, but the actual one that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7709)|
| 2:08:31| voting on is adopt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7711)|
| 2:08:33| resolution which was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7713)|
| 2:08:35| sent to us by MPC, which is not the exact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7715)|
| 2:08:37| same thing as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7717)|
| 2:08:39| what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7719)|
| 2:08:41| Knox County, what we originally sent back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7721)|
| 2:08:43| You're about to talk to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7723)|
| 2:08:45| Mr. Skinner. I was just going to say, and this is what was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7725)|
| 2:08:47| agreed upon by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7727)|
| 2:08:49| the residents in the area, the staff, everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7729)|
| 2:08:51| got together, and that's why they came up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7731)|
| 2:08:53| with the special-use district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7733)|
| 2:08:55| That's correct. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7735)|
| 2:08:57| So, to answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7737)|
| 2:08:59| your question, if the applicants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7739)|
| 2:09:01| in agreement with the Metropolitan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7741)|
| 2:09:03| Planning Commission has sort of negotiated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7743)|
| 2:09:05| this with the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7745)|
| 2:09:07| a proper motion would be to approve per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7747)|
| 2:09:09| MPC recommendation. Okay, very well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7749)|
| 2:09:11| because the request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7751)|
| 2:09:13| was from Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7753)|
| 2:09:15| and the action, as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7755)|
| 2:09:17| clarified in here, is to adopt the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7757)|
| 2:09:19| resolution as it came to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7759)|
| 2:09:21| So, I guess I want to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7761)|
| 2:09:23| very clear that when we voted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7763)|
| 2:09:25| we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7765)|
| 2:09:27| voting on the action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7767)|
| 2:09:29| not the requestor. Is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7769)|
| 2:09:31| correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7771)|
| 2:09:33| Yes. Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7773)|
| 2:09:35| Commissioner Carringer, your light came on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7775)|
| 2:09:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7777)|
| 2:09:39| On what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7779)|
| 2:09:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7781)|
| 2:09:43| And does the second agree on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7783)|
| 2:09:45| Approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7785)|
| 2:09:47| per MPC recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7787)|
| 2:09:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7789)|
| 2:09:51| And the second agrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7791)|
| 2:09:53| Okay. Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7793)|
| 2:09:55| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7795)|
| 2:09:57| I think what has happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7797)|
| 2:09:59| and Director Green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7799)|
| 2:10:01| and Mr. Davis, if I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7801)|
| 2:10:03| incorrect, please let me know, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7803)|
| 2:10:05| the residents in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7805)|
| 2:10:07| feared that the just high density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7807)|
| 2:10:09| without a special condition district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7809)|
| 2:10:11| on it would lead to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7811)|
| 2:10:13| further high density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7813)|
| 2:10:15| development and I believe you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7815)|
| 2:10:17| have worked out a compromise that allows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7817)|
| 2:10:19| the developer to do what they want to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7819)|
| 2:10:21| without putting that possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7821)|
| 2:10:23| out there in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7823)|
| 2:10:25| That's correct, yes sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7825)|
| 2:10:27| I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7827)|
| 2:10:29| Scott Davis, PO Box 11315.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7829)|
| 2:10:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7831)|
| 2:10:33| Alright, we've got the first and the second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7833)|
| 2:10:35| are in agreement on that. We've already voted. Daniel, are we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7835)|
| 2:10:37| good to go on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7837)|
| 2:10:39| We can re-vote it just to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7839)|
| 2:10:41| make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7841)|
| 2:10:43| The question came to my mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7843)|
| 2:10:45| as you called the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7845)|
| 2:10:47| I understood it to mean per MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7847)|
| 2:10:49| recommendations, but if you want to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7849)|
| 2:10:51| Then we're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7851)|
| 2:10:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7853)|
| 2:10:55| Alright, we'll go ahead and announce the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7855)|
| 2:10:57| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7857)|
| 2:10:59| Per MPC recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7859)|
| 2:11:01| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7861)|
| 2:11:03| Thank you Mr. Chairman. I just want to take a quick moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7863)|
| 2:11:05| to thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7865)|
| 2:11:07| Mr. Davis and Mr. Green for sitting down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7867)|
| 2:11:09| with the neighbors. I know when this sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7869)|
| 2:11:11| this whole project came around the first time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7871)|
| 2:11:13| there were a lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7873)|
| 2:11:15| that raised a lot of flags and were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7875)|
| 2:11:17| in our ear and I think this is for all those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7877)|
| 2:11:19| who say that developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7879)|
| 2:11:21| don't care about their neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7881)|
| 2:11:23| This is a perfect example of when everybody got the chance to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7883)|
| 2:11:25| sit down, work through it, find a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7885)|
| 2:11:27| compromise and be good neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7887)|
| 2:11:29| together and so I just applaud you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7889)|
| 2:11:31| I just wanted to take a moment to say that. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7891)|

| 2:12:13| 20 acre site. That would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7933)|
| 2:12:15| recognize the current development and bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=7935)|

| 2:15:03| Everett Road, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8103)|
| 2:15:05| No, because we did a stream determination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8105)|

| 2:17:15| but I do want to make sure we give this proper service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8235)|
| 2:17:17| If I might summarize, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8237)|

| 2:17:47| We also agreed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8267)|
| 2:17:49| to, I guess, generally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8269)|
| 2:17:51| support the state initiatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8271)|
| 2:17:53| that Commissioner Schoonmaker brought to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8273)|

| 2:17:57| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8277)|
| 2:17:59| I brought up making particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8279)|
| 2:18:01| emphasis as backed by Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8281)|
| 2:18:03| on making sure that local sales tax is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8283)|
| 2:18:05| forgotten when the state finally gets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8285)|
| 2:18:07| around to join in the consortium to collect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8287)|
| 2:18:09| national sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8289)|
| 2:18:11| So where does that leave us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8291)|
| 2:18:13| What I might propose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8293)|
| 2:18:15| is I can take all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8295)|

| 2:18:47| She booked a space and has got breakfast on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8327)|
| 2:18:49| order. I don't know if it's going to be biscuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8329)|
| 2:18:51| The first part of that meeting with our legislator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8331)|
| 2:18:53| is going to be focusing on school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8333)|
| 2:18:55| items. However, we are welcome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8335)|
| 2:18:57| to sit there and listen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8337)|
| 2:18:59| and kind of be there to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8339)|
| 2:19:01| and participate as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8341)|
| 2:19:03| But she does want to find out how many people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8343)|
| 2:19:05| are going to be coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8345)|
| 2:19:07| Without any further ado,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8347)|
| 2:19:09| how many of you by a show of hands are going to be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8349)|
| 2:19:11| at the first part when our school board is there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8351)|
| 2:19:13| We've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8353)|
| 2:19:15| Is your hand up, Evelyn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8355)|
| 2:19:17| And that's Friday the 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8357)|
| 2:19:19| So we've got 1, 2, 3, 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8359)|
| 2:19:21| 5, 6, 7, 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8361)|
| 2:19:23| So it looks like everybody except| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8363)|
| 2:19:25| Commissioner Anders and Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8365)|
| 2:19:27| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8367)|
| 2:19:29| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8369)|
| 2:19:31| Commissioner Bussler, are you going to be there for our time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8371)|
| 2:19:33| as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8373)|
| 2:19:35| You'll be out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8375)|
| 2:19:37| He's mad. He's leaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8377)|
| 2:19:39| So it looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8379)|
| 2:19:41| all of our commissioners will be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8381)|
| 2:19:43| and about 10 of them will be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8383)|
| 2:19:45| for the breakfast at the first part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8385)|
| 2:19:47| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8387)|
| 2:19:49| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8389)|
| 2:19:51| Every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8391)|
| 2:19:53| it seems we get a late start on this legislative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8393)|
| 2:19:55| decision discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8395)|
| 2:19:57| I believe we have no elections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8397)|
| 2:19:59| next year for anybody on this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8399)|
| 2:20:01| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8401)|
| 2:20:03| I suggest next year we start this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8403)|
| 2:20:05| in August or September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8405)|
| 2:20:07| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8407)|
| 2:20:09| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8409)|
| 2:20:11| Well, our body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8411)|
| 2:20:13| and their body, there's nobody going through an election next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8413)|
| 2:20:15| That's what I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8415)|
| 2:20:17| This year we kind of waited because we knew we had new people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8417)|
| 2:20:19| coming on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8419)|
| 2:20:21| Well, new people and Eddie Smith had been our point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8421)|
| 2:20:23| and then he didn't win his election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8423)|
| 2:20:25| so frankly that was something he had been driving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8425)|
| 2:20:27| for the last...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8427)|
| 2:20:29| Even in the years that it hadn't, it's always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8429)|
| 2:20:31| been a struggle to go through these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8431)|
| 2:20:33| in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8433)|
| 2:20:35| We've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8435)|
| 2:20:37| a committee to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8437)|
| 2:20:39| I'm a very confident Commissioner Schoonmaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8439)|
| 2:20:41| in that committee which was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8441)|
| 2:20:43| just formed to really help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8443)|
| 2:20:45| drive this moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8445)|
| 2:20:47| Is there any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8447)|
| 2:20:49| announcements because frankly I feel like we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8449)|
| 2:20:51| at the end of agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8451)|
| 2:20:53| We're going to have to get back to this and have the clerks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8453)|
| 2:20:55| kind of work us through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8455)|
| 2:20:57| Alright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8457)|
| 2:20:59| Any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8459)|
| 2:21:01| on this? I've got what we've got to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8461)|
| 2:21:03| a date to visit the Forensic Center and I'm going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8463)|
| 2:21:05| put it on the forum. But go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8465)|
| 2:21:07| Commissioner Schoonmaker. I was just going to say for your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8467)|
| 2:21:09| calendars for January, just remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8469)|
| 2:21:11| that we will not be meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8471)|
| 2:21:13| on the 21st, we're meeting on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8473)|
| 2:21:15| 22nd which is Tuesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8475)|
| 2:21:17| and prior to the work session we will have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8477)|
| 2:21:19| a finance committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8479)|
| 2:21:21| And I'm trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8481)|
| 2:21:23| to arrange, I think it might be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8483)|
| 2:21:25| relevant to have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8485)|
| 2:21:27| person come and speak regarding the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8487)|
| 2:21:29| internet sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8489)|
| 2:21:31| So that would be a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8491)|
| 2:21:33| 20 minute or 30 minute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8493)|
| 2:21:35| discussion that would be valuable for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8495)|
| 2:21:37| And just one other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8497)|
| 2:21:39| announcement. I just wanted to recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8499)|
| 2:21:41| Commissioner Gill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8501)|
| 2:21:43| for setting up the event last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8503)|
| 2:21:45| evening. It was great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8505)|
| 2:21:47| because a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8507)|
| 2:21:49| former Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8509)|
| 2:21:51| Commissioner was recognized last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8511)|

| 2:21:57| just thought that was very well done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8517)|
| 2:21:59| and I commend you for doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8519)|
| 2:22:01| that. Because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8521)|
| 2:22:03| knew that Commissioner personally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8523)|
| 2:22:05| and I thought I could tell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8525)|
| 2:22:07| she was very, very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8527)|
| 2:22:09| surprised and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8529)|

| 2:22:17| good turnout. And part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8537)|
| 2:22:19| the reason we wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8539)|
| 2:22:21| start a meet and greet during the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8541)|
| 2:22:23| holidays, maybe another Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8543)|
| 2:22:25| will pick it up and rotate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8545)|
| 2:22:27| so that people can have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8547)|
| 2:22:29| an opportunity to see other parts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8549)|
| 2:22:31| of the county and experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8551)|
| 2:22:33| simply a holiday meet and greet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8553)|
| 2:22:35| with their Commissioner and other elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8555)|
| 2:22:37| officials. We really appreciate the support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8557)|
| 2:22:39| of the city that came out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8559)|
| 2:22:41| and we just had a really good time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8561)|
| 2:22:43| Thank you. Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8563)|
| 2:22:45| And I need to say it was Commissioner Diane Jordan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8565)|
| 2:22:47| that we recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8567)|
| 2:22:51| I want to remind everybody that the Joint Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8571)|
| 2:22:53| Committee meets Wednesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8573)|

| 2:22:57| the first floor of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8577)|
| 2:22:59| the AJ building. In addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8579)|
| 2:23:01| to somebody from the state being there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8581)|
| 2:23:03| to go over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8583)|
| 2:23:05| BEP formula, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8585)|
| 2:23:07| I would highly advise everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8587)|
| 2:23:09| to try to attend that to figure it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8589)|
| 2:23:11| I'm going to have some questions that I'm going to bounce off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8591)|
| 2:23:13| them to see what kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8593)|
| 2:23:15| how they compare to what I got off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8595)|
| 2:23:17| somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8597)|
| 2:23:19| And also there's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8599)|
| 2:23:21| school budget 101,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8601)|

| 2:23:27| school's budget is a very complex thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8607)|
| 2:23:29| It would probably be a very good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8609)|
| 2:23:31| idea to also hear that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181217?start=8611)|
