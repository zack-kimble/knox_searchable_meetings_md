| 0:07:33| There are no items to be postponed for, or do we vote on this to remove from postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=453)|
| 0:07:43| I said that was the only one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=463)|

| 0:08:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=491)|
| 0:08:12| I thought we discussed that the city charter says that we can only visit those items quarterly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=492)|
| 0:08:18| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=498)|

| 0:08:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=502)|
| 0:08:23| The action taken by this commission to make any recommendation would not move forward to the city council until February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=503)|
| 0:08:29| The neighborhood and the applicants have been notified that it was on automatic postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=509)|
| 0:08:35| I don't know if they're ready to present their either side of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=515)|
| 0:08:38| So when we get to that for discussion, staff will strongly recommend postponement for 60 days because of those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=518)|

| 0:12:50| Thank you, Carlene Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=770)|
| 0:12:51| I would just ask for what Mr. Green has requested, that 36 and 37 be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=771)|

| 0:13:00| Motion to hear consent with the exceptions of items number 36 and 37.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=780)|
| 0:13:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=784)|
| 0:13:06| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=786)|
| 0:13:08| Yes, this is the time to, do you have something you'd like removed from consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=788)|
| 0:13:11| Yes, I'd like to remove item number 17, Beacon Development of Tennessee from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=791)|
| 0:13:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=798)|
| 0:13:24| Is there anyone else wanting to have something removed from consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=804)|
| 0:13:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=814)|
| 0:13:35| Name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=815)|

| 0:13:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=832)|
| 0:13:53| Yes, both of those will be heard at their regularly scheduled time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=833)|
| 0:13:57| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=837)|

| 0:14:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=845)|
| 0:14:06| Madam Chair, I'll amend my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=846)|
| 0:14:09| I make a motion that we hear consent with the exceptions of items 17, 23, 36, and 37.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=849)|
| 0:14:18| Second motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=858)|
| 0:14:19| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Phillips to hear consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=859)|
| 0:14:24| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=864)|
| 0:14:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=866)|
| 0:14:27| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=867)|
| 0:14:28| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=868)|
| 0:14:30| Motion to approve consent is read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=870)|
| 0:14:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=872)|
| 0:14:33| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Phillips to approve consent as read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=873)|
| 0:14:38| I see no lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=878)|
| 0:14:39| I see no one at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=879)|
| 0:14:41| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=881)|
| 0:14:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=882)|
| 0:14:43| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=883)|
| 0:14:44| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=884)|
| 0:14:51| First item on the agenda is item number nine, which came off of postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=891)|
| 0:15:05| The applicant is Jennifer Reynolds, Baxter Properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=905)|
| 0:15:09| The location is at the intersection of Adair Drive and Sanders Drive, west of Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=909)|
| 0:15:16| The tract information is .52 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=916)|
| 0:15:20| Present plan designation and zoning is LDR, Low Density Residential, R1, Low Density Residential, and R2, General Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=920)|
| 0:15:33| Proposed plan designation and zoning is GC, General Commercial, for 220 Adair Drive only, C3, General Commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=933)|
| 0:15:45| The existing land use is O, Office, and SFR, Single Family Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=945)|
| 0:15:51| All structures have been demolished, so the parcels are now vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=951)|
| 0:15:55| The proposed use is a beer garden, commercial use of similar character to commercial node at the corner of Sanders Drive, Tazewell Pike, and Jacksboro Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=955)|
| 0:16:07| The staff recommendation is to postpone the one-year plan amendment request for 60 days, and also to postpone the rezoning request for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=967)|
| 0:16:20| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=980)|
| 0:16:24| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=984)|
| 0:16:28| Carlene Malone, 6051 Fountain Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| This is a little confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=991)|
| 0:16:36| I'm not here in opposition to the 60-day postponement, which the applicant has agreed to and the staff has recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=996)|
| 0:16:43| I am here in opposition, though, to the idea that postponements for the one-year plan can only be heard four times a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1003)|
| 0:16:52| That has not been the policy or the practice since the one-year plan went into effect back in the 80s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1012)|
| 0:17:01| I can give you, and you can get for yourself if you go through the archives, example after example where there has been a postponement for one month, two months, seven months, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1021)|
| 0:17:15| I also disagree with the idea or the statement that this is set out in the City of Knoxville Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1035)|
| 0:17:28| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1048)|
| 0:17:30| It is set out in the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1050)|
| 0:17:33| The language may not be specific as to whether or not it's talking about four times a year for the initial application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1053)|
| 0:17:43| In other words, a new application can't come in four times a year, but a postponement can be for any amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1063)|
| 0:17:51| To set a postponement at a minimum of three months is to do away with postponements because it is so draconian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1071)|
| 0:18:00| You'll get somebody beyond even a building season, so you'll have to go as soon as it's on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1080)|
| 0:18:08| I suggest you look carefully at what has been done since the 1980s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1088)|
| 0:18:15| Look at the practice, which has been one-month postponements and more, and seriously consider clarifying the language in the one-year plan document regarding this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1095)|
| 0:18:30| It is not in the Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| As an indication of how the practice has worked, your own rules say that the applicant can request a one-time 30-day postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1112)|
| 0:18:48| It doesn't say, except for plan amendments, which are for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1128)|
| 0:18:55| That's an indication of how the practice has operated over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1135)|
| 0:19:00| Again, we have no opposition to the 60-day postponement for this item, but we do have opposition and serious questions about the 90-day interpretation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1140)|
| 0:19:12| which we think is just fallacious and is in no one's best interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1152)|
| 0:19:16| Thank you, Ms. Malone. I'm going to ask Mr. Green to address your concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1156)|
| 0:19:20| The City Council hears one-year plan amendments quarterly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1160)|
| 0:19:24| We understand the importance that the community places on the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1164)|
| 0:19:28| Our attempt is to not continue to do things the way we've always done them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1168)|
| 0:19:34| If we did that, we'd still be living in caves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1174)|
| 0:19:37| So we're trying to bring all aspects of our review of one-plan amendments into sync and doing all aspects quarterly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1177)|
| 0:19:46| Again, placing the importance on the one-year plan that the City intended through its charter amendment and charter statements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1186)|
| 0:19:53| that one-year plan amendments are heard by City Council once a quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| The applicant did not request this postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1197)|
| 0:20:02| It was recommended by staff, and the applicant agreed to it in order to address concerns of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1202)|
| 0:20:09| and also understanding that the City Council would only hear this request quarterly for the one-year plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1209)|
| 0:20:16| Commissioner Hill, your light was on and then off and then on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1216)|
| 0:20:19| Is it on? It's off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1219)|
| 0:20:22| Is mine on or off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1222)|
| 0:20:24| Yours is off. Do you want yours on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1224)|
| 0:20:27| Okay, I'm going to call on Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1227)|
| 0:20:30| I just want to make sure I understand. The City Council will hear this four times a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1230)|
| 0:20:36| What we're hearing complaints on is the fact that we don't go ahead and hear them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1236)|
| 0:20:42| If the next City Council hears this three months from now, why would we not go ahead and hear it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1242)|
| 0:20:50| and be able to send our recommendation on to them even if it's two months early?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1250)|
| 0:20:55| Unless I'm missing something, it would seem logical that we could go ahead and act on ours if we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1255)|
| 0:21:01| and we wait until right up against the City Council's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1261)|
| 0:21:05| There may be neighbors, there may be opposition, we may have a postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1265)|
| 0:21:09| which would delay this guy not 90 days but another 90 days for the next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1269)|
| 0:21:12| What I'm saying is why wouldn't we go ahead as MPC and hear that when it comes in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1272)|
| 0:21:17| I think that's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1277)|
| 0:21:19| One of the reasons on this one was that the applicant wanted more time to address concerns of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1279)|
| 0:21:25| to see if they could address those legitimate concerns of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1285)|
| 0:21:30| That's the reason they consented to the postponement also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1290)|
| 0:21:35| Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1295)|
| 0:21:37| It's the same thing as Scott here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1297)|
| 0:21:40| We control our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1300)|
| 0:21:45| City Council controls theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1305)|
| 0:21:47| We go ahead and hear it, hear it through, send it to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1307)|
| 0:21:53| They can act on it in their time according to their rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1313)|
| 0:21:58| But I think that our rules, if they're vague, should state exactly that one-year plan amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1318)|
| 0:22:07| once they're introduced or once the item is introduced, is on our agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1327)|
| 0:22:16| that the postponements follow the same track as any other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1336)|
| 0:22:23| And we can make those clarifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1343)|
| 0:22:25| Staff will bring something to the commission to clarify that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1345)|
| 0:22:29| and we'll provide options what we think is the best route and accept input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1349)|
| 0:22:33| Again, on this one, I think it's best to postpone because the applicant wants to work with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1353)|
| 0:22:39| We weren't really addressing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1359)|
| 0:22:41| It's just a way to get on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1363)|
| 0:22:44| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1364)|
| 0:22:46| Ms. Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1366)|
| 0:22:47| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1367)|
| 0:22:48| If I can just say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| I sat on City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1370)|
| 0:22:52| We heard plan amendments 12 months a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1375)|
| 0:22:56| I don't know where anyone is getting the idea that council only hears them four times a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1376)|
| 0:23:02| And, again, it's not in the charter, if that's what you've been told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1382)|
| 0:23:07| Second, we may want to do, you all may want to do things in a way that is different from how you've done it before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1387)|
| 0:23:14| Fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1394)|
| 0:23:18| But let's not pretend that this is something that's always been done this way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1398)|
| 0:23:24| or that this is some rule or charter regulation or something of council because it isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1404)|
| 0:23:31| It just simply isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| And if you think it is, ask them to show it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| Don't take their word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| And I will say that in the time I've been here, the City Council, yes, hears sector plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1418)|
| 0:23:44| One-year plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1424)|
| 0:23:45| But one-year plan amendments are heard quarterly, and that's the way it's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1425)|
| 0:23:50| One-year plan amendments are heard whenever they get on the council agenda, and that is not quarterly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1430)|
| 0:23:56| It has never been limited to quarterly, ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1436)|
| 0:24:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1441)|
| 0:24:02| From the time that I've been on Planning Commission and also as a resident of South Knoxville, that has been my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1442)|
| 0:24:10| Well, are you forgetting the Harvey at Morelia thing a few months ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1450)|
| 0:24:18| That was postponed one month here and was right on the next council agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1458)|
| 0:24:24| Look it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1464)|
| 0:24:25| Go through your, you know, the minutes are available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1468)|
| 0:24:30| Sounds like some research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1470)|
| 0:24:31| Madam Chair, my light's not functioning, but I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| We've postponed for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| And I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1476)|
| 0:24:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1477)|
| 0:24:38| We have a motion by Commissioner Phillips, a second by Commissioner Clancy to postpone for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1478)|
| 0:24:44| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1484)|
| 0:24:48| I see no one else at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| No other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1490)|
| 0:24:51| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1491)|
| 0:24:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1492)|
| 0:24:53| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1493)|
| 0:24:54| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1494)|
| 0:25:00| Now we're moving on to agenda item number 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1500)|
| 0:25:05| The applicant is Peter Dadsey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1505)|
| 0:25:09| The location is the north side, Western Avenue, east of Minder's Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1509)|
| 0:25:15| My goodness, I haven't heard of that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1515)|
| 0:25:17| Minder's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1517)|
| 0:25:18| Minder's Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1518)|
| 0:25:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1519)|
| 0:25:21| Approximate size of the tract is .7 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1521)|
| 0:25:24| Present zoning is I-3, General Industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1524)|
| 0:25:28| Zoning requested is C-6, General Commercial Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1528)|
| 0:25:33| The existing land use is vacant parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1533)|
| 0:25:36| The proposed use is used automobile sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1536)|
| 0:25:40| Staff recommendation is to deny C-6, General Commercial Park district zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1540)|
| 0:25:46| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1546)|
| 0:25:48| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1548)|
| 0:25:49| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1549)|
| 0:25:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1552)|
| 0:25:53| Your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1553)|
| 0:25:55| My name is Peter Dadsey, 2553 Western Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1555)|
| 0:26:02| Yes, and what would you like to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1562)|
| 0:26:05| Well, I want the commissioner to please hear me out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1565)|
| 0:26:09| I have done everything possible to establish an automobile dealership on that area of tract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1569)|
| 0:26:16| I've spent a lot of money on this particular project right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1576)|
| 0:26:21| But the current zoning shows that automobile assembling and stuff like that is allowed at this zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1581)|
| 0:26:28| And truck sale and leasing are also allowed at this zone currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1588)|
| 0:26:33| That's one reason I bought the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| Now we're moving on to a recall coming up the next coming year that it takes away all of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1595)|
| 0:26:42| This property was bought purposely for this reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1602)|
| 0:26:47| Please, I need your help on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1607)|
| 0:26:51| I want you to hear me out on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1611)|
| 0:26:53| On this piece of property that I have, I'm intending to improve the property for the community use of sedan automobiles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1613)|
| 0:27:00| and keeping the environment clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| Now, we have a used car dealership just a few blocks away from me, which has done used cars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1622)|
| 0:27:08| just a few blocks away from me, and that is allowed to sell used cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1628)|
| 0:27:13| And I also currently have a business called Africa Modus on the same Western Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1633)|
| 0:27:18| That is just one mile away from this actual location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1638)|
| 0:27:22| And now on this location, my current location, I'm getting a hard time of parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1642)|
| 0:27:29| If the vehicle parks at the Bojangles parking lot, the next thing, the Bojangles is going to complain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1649)|
| 0:27:35| And this park on the right-hand side, they also complain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| So for that reason, I bought this property that is a little bit farther from even the Dollar General| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1658)|
| 0:27:43| and other properties around so that I'll be able to rezone it to a C6 zone and do something peacefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1663)|
| 0:27:50| I came down in this country to find a living and a better future for me, myself, and my community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1670)|
| 0:27:56| I'm appealing to all of you to please rethink it, to give me that C6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1676)|
| 0:28:01| And I promise, any condition, I will accept it, to keep it clean and live by the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1681)|
| 0:28:06| I just want to live in peace and do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1686)|
| 0:28:10| I'm just appealing to please rethink it and give me that zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1690)|
| 0:28:14| It's just an appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1696)|
| 0:28:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1697)|
| 0:28:19| Ms. Portier, can you address the issues here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1699)|
| 0:28:24| Can you give us a little bit more background?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1704)|
| 0:28:26| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1706)|
| 0:28:27| So the property that Mr. Dadzie is speaking of is located in the I-3 district currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1707)|
| 0:28:32| It does not allow used car sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1712)|
| 0:28:34| It does allow vehicle storage facility, which the ordinance defines as storage of wrecked vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1714)|
| 0:28:40| The other automobile allowed use in I-3 is automobile assembling, painting, upholstering, rebuilding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1720)|
| 0:28:46| reconditioning, body fender works, truck repairing and overhaul, tire retreading, and so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1726)|
| 0:28:54| Typically, whenever there's a use that's defined and the use is in a district, we look for that use elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1734)|
| 0:29:00| So used car sales and vehicle sales are allowed in C-4, for example, using that verbiage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1740)|
| 0:29:05| but that verbiage is absent under I-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| So we've advised Mr. Dadzie that if he wanted to rezone to C-6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1748)|
| 0:29:14| that's the only commercial zoning that's allowed within the light industrial sector plan designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1754)|
| 0:29:19| So it would be allowed currently under the LI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| However, once the new zoning ordinance takes effect in January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1762)|
| 0:29:26| that C-6 zoning becomes IMU or industrial mixed use, which does not allow vehicle sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1766)|
| 0:29:35| And we've been, as part of the review of our zoning code, zoning map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1775)|
| 0:29:41| we've been asked by the Chamber of Commerce to try to preserve industrial areas in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1781)|
| 0:29:47| And this one property is in the midst of an industrial zoning, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1787)|
| 0:29:54| industrially zoned area, so we're trying to preserve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1794)|
| 0:29:58| One additional item of information, the planning has been asked by County Commissioner Randy Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1798)|
| 0:30:05| and now City Council Member Seema Singh to do a corridor study for all of Western Avenue and Oak Ridge Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1805)|
| 0:30:13| to look at the best uses of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1813)|
| 0:30:16| That may change the zoning of some areas, looking at it more comprehensively sometime next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1816)|
| 0:30:23| Excuse me, next year. That won't happen. It won't help Mr. Dodsey now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1823)|
| 0:30:29| But that review may identify appropriate locations for auto sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1829)|
| 0:30:34| that would not infringe on the industrial areas of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1834)|
| 0:30:42| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1842)|
| 0:30:44| Thank you, Madam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1844)|
| 0:30:46| I'm a little confused as if we vote in favor of the C-6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1846)|
| 0:30:53| is there a mechanism such as a letter to the building department that he now qualifies under the vested?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1853)|
| 0:31:02| That would be one option that we could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1862)|
| 0:31:05| Also, as we transformed our current zoning into the new zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1865)|
| 0:31:11| C-6 sometimes went to IMU and sometimes to commercial category depending on the use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1871)|
| 0:31:17| So we would look not only at the character of the surrounding area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1877)|
| 0:31:20| and uniformity of zoning and making that change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1880)|
| 0:31:24| but at the individual use and the individual use in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1884)|
| 0:31:29| If the commission recommends approval of the rezoning and City Council approves that rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1889)|
| 0:31:36| we'd look at the intended use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1896)|
| 0:31:39| There might be a low island of a commercial highway in the midst of an IMU district there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1899)|
| 0:31:51| Okay, so then in effect he would be grandfathered in, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1911)|
| 0:31:54| Yes, he would. Either grandfathered or made for permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1914)|
| 0:31:59| I mean, simply ask what's the harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1919)|
| 0:32:02| I mean, I think in this condition we're probably not going to assemble industrial property for an industrial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1922)|
| 0:32:10| It's a small parcel. I know that I would be in favor of rezoning to a C-6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1930)|
| 0:32:16| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1936)|
| 0:32:17| Yes, Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| Michelle, there's a C-4, I mean, right down the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1939)|
| 0:32:25| and I know C-4 allows for used car sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1945)|
| 0:32:31| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1951)|
| 0:32:32| When recode comes through, what will happen to that piece of C-4 property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1952)|
| 0:32:38| I'd ask staff if they could pull up the recode compare map and we can see what that parcel will go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1958)|
| 0:32:45| So the C-4 district that he's talking about is northwest of the DADC property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1965)|
| 0:32:53| It'll be C-8? Is that it? C-H-1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1978)|
| 0:33:01| And C-H-1 allows for car sales?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1981)|
| 0:33:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1985)|
| 0:33:07| I'm with Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1987)|
| 0:33:12| If there was nothing there, and that piece of property is not going to be able to be used for any type of industrial use, I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=1992)|
| 0:33:21| So I'd like to go ahead and make a motion that we approve C-6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2001)|
| 0:33:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2005)|
| 0:33:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2006)|
| 0:33:28| That was the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2008)|
| 0:33:30| Commissioner Hill, we have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2010)|
| 0:33:35| Commissioner, your light was on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| Did you have something you'd like to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| I hate to say that Mr. Clancy made a little sense, but he's probably said enough for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2019)|
| 0:33:46| It would be the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| So I see no other lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2028)|
| 0:33:52| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2032)|
| 0:33:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2034)|
| 0:33:55| Is there any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2037)|
| 0:33:58| Sir, you've got your spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2038)|
| 0:34:05| At least we didn't make somebody mad today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2045)|
| 0:34:08| What in the world's wrong with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2048)|
| 0:34:11| That was a first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2051)|
| 0:34:14| Give us time, Mark. Give us time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2054)|
| 0:34:16| Be patient. Be patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2056)|
| 0:34:18| Next on the agenda is item number 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2058)|
| 0:34:22| The applicant is Jason Baker, B&B Builders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2062)|
| 0:34:27| The location is the south side of East Emery Road, northeast of Brown Gap Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2067)|
| 0:34:33| Approximate size of the tract is 17.4 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2073)|
| 0:34:37| Present zoning is A, agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| The zoning requested is PR, planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2080)|
| 0:34:44| Existing land use is vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2084)|
| 0:34:46| Proposed use is single family attached residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2086)|
| 0:34:50| And the density proposed is five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2090)|
| 0:34:54| Staff recommendation is to approve PR, planned residential, up to 3.5 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2094)|
| 0:35:01| The applicant requested up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2101)|
| 0:35:06| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2106)|
| 0:35:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2107)|
| 0:35:08| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2108)|
| 0:35:11| I see no opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2111)|
| 0:35:12| Mr. Harbin, your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| David Harbin, 4334 Paper Mill Drive here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2115)|
| 0:35:19| And I'm going to ask that Ms. Patterson pass out a handout, if that would be okay, to assist us in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2119)|
| 0:35:28| This 17.5 acre tract right here is directly onto Emery Road, which is an arterial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2128)|
| 0:35:34| We have water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2134)|
| 0:35:35| We have sewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2135)|
| 0:35:36| The land lays really good for a residential subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2136)|
| 0:35:41| There is a creek that goes through the front part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2141)|
| 0:35:43| We'll adhere to the Knox County standards for creek buffers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2143)|
| 0:35:49| What Ms. Patterson is passing out right now is just another little map that we've prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2149)|
| 0:35:57| I believe NPC staff has prepared another map as well that shows the comparable densities around that area there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2157)|
| 0:36:07| And on that one, you can see a little bit further away from us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2167)|
| 0:36:12| there's a couple of developments there at 1.9, 3.4 units an acre, and 3.7 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2172)|
| 0:36:19| And they use that as justification to allow 3.5, which is what staff has recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2179)|
| 0:36:28| For us, after we have made the application, we've surveyed the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2188)|
| 0:36:32| and determined how much right-of-way dedication we'll have to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2192)|
| 0:36:37| we can actually get by with four units an acre out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2197)|
| 0:36:41| and be able to implement the plan that Mr. Baker desires to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2201)|
| 0:36:46| And so that's our request to rezone it at PR at four units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2206)|
| 0:36:51| If you look at the handout there that Ms. Patterson handed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2211)|
| 0:36:56| you can see that there's several other developments nearby, a little bit closer to town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2216)|
| 0:37:01| which is well in excess of four units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2221)|
| 0:37:04| Tyler's Garden has 4.6 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2224)|
| 0:37:07| One we're doing right now, Snowmass, we got that approved at 4.83,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2227)|
| 0:37:12| and Tara's Point was 4.1 units an acre, a little bit closer to town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2232)|
| 0:37:17| So we're here just asking that you would allow a density for us of four units an acre right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2237)|
| 0:37:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2244)|
| 0:37:25| Ms. Albertson, would you like to make any comments on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2245)|
| 0:37:29| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2249)|
| 0:37:31| We recommended 3.5 based on the surrounding density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2251)|
| 0:37:37| Again, as on your screen, you can see that there's a range of 1.9 to 3.7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2257)|
| 0:37:45| These are a little bit closer to the subject property than what Mr. Harbin has shown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2265)|
| 0:37:52| This location is about 1.3 miles to the intersection of Maynardville Pike and East Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2272)|
| 0:38:03| His other developments that he's referenced are quite a bit closer to that commercial node,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2283)|
| 0:38:13| but the existing zoning out there has recommended up to five dwelling units an acre in some places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2293)|
| 0:38:20| However, they weren't actually built out as that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2300)|
| 0:38:23| So staff holds that 3.5 should be the recommended density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2303)|
| 0:38:30| Thank you. Commissioner Hooten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2310)|
| 0:38:33| Yeah, we had a little bit of discussion on this on Tuesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2313)|
| 0:38:36| and I don't want to get down into the weeds of the weighted average of the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2316)|
| 0:38:43| and how old some of these comparable zoning densities, how old they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2323)|
| 0:38:49| different lot sizes, and what people build today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| But if we're a half an acre more on a zoning request from what staff is recommending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2333)|
| 0:39:00| and the applicant has got a creek to deal with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2340)|
| 0:39:04| which means he's going to have to provide a buffer in some common areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2344)|
| 0:39:07| we also talked on Tuesday that we would want to make sure that the appropriate common areas set aside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2347)|
| 0:39:12| would match the density that would be requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2352)|
| 0:39:15| So I would be in favor of the four per the acre, and I would make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2355)|
| 0:39:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| We have a motion by Commissioner Hooten and a second by Commissioner Clancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2361)|
| 0:39:25| to approve planned residential up to four dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2365)|
| 0:39:30| And I see the two lights that were on over here just went off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2370)|
| 0:39:35| And I don't see any other lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2375)|
| 0:39:36| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2376)|
| 0:39:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| Are there any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2380)|
| 0:39:41| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2381)|
| 0:39:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2382)|
| 0:39:47| To agenda item number 17,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2387)|
| 0:39:54| this is Beacon Development of Tennessee, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| The location is the south side of Middlebrook Pike east of Old Cedar Bluff Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2398)|
| 0:40:04| Approximate size of the tract is 6.87 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2404)|
| 0:40:08| Present zoning is A, agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2408)|
| 0:40:11| Zoning requested is PR, planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2411)|
| 0:40:15| Existing land use is a dwelling which is to be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2415)|
| 0:40:19| The proposed use is senior housing development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2419)|
| 0:40:22| And the density proposed is five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2422)|
| 0:40:26| The staff recommendation is to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2426)|
| 0:40:30| PR, planned residential, at five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2430)|
| 0:40:33| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2433)|
| 0:40:36| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2436)|
| 0:40:39| Sir, as the applicant, would you like to go first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2439)|
| 0:40:42| or hear from the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2442)|
| 0:40:44| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| Sir, name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| Stephen Sullivan, 825 Plainfield Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| I'm a property owner adjacent to the zoning change requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2450)|
| 0:40:54| My first point in opposition is the density request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2454)|
| 0:40:57| of five dwelling units per acre is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2457)|
| 0:41:00| inconsistent with surrounding zoning of four dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2463)|
| 0:41:06| That would be an additional six units built on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2466)|
| 0:41:09| Six additional units means additional parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2469)|
| 0:41:12| Additional parking spaces means additional asphalt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2472)|
| 0:41:15| We have stormwater runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| And in the Cedar Bluff area in this spring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| we experienced severe stormwater issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| which basically shut down main arteries in and out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2481)|
| 0:41:23| of that city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| We'd like to avoid any sort of future development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| that causes more asphalt than land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2487)|
| 0:41:31| Actually, in support of that first point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| I'd like to quote from the actual existing property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| owner's letter in support of this application, where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2495)|
| 0:41:39| he says basically, and I'll get to it in just one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2499)|
| 0:41:42| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2502)|
| 0:41:46| We're excited that the developer's plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| will enable a good amount of the property aesthetics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2508)|
| 0:41:51| and integrity that my family has built over the years to remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2511)|
| 0:41:54| I find that in stark contrast to the request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2514)|
| 0:41:57| to support five dwelling units per acre, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2517)|
| 0:41:59| at a 6.6 or so acre property, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2519)|
| 0:42:03| looking at 30 units or so to be developed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2523)|
| 0:42:07| The other thing I'd like to mention is that I'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| like to commend the commission and the applicant's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2529)|
| 0:42:13| use of Google Maps liberally to point out things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2533)|
| 0:42:16| I'd like to also say that when one is running a Google Map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2536)|
| 0:42:19| search of senior housing that's already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| available in the Knoxville area, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| get a map that has more thumbtacks than a kindergarten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2543)|
| 0:42:26| bulletin board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2546)|
| 0:42:27| So it can be used both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| And I would just like to make the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2549)|
| 0:42:31| that I believe we have adequate senior housing already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| available in the Knoxville area, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| don't believe the zoning change in support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2555)|
| 0:42:36| of additional senior housing warrants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2556)|
| 0:42:39| the change in the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2559)|
| 0:42:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2560)|
| 0:42:41| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2561)|
| 0:42:42| Applicant, would you like to address the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2562)|
| 0:42:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2566)|
| 0:42:46| Name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2566)|

| 0:42:55| I have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2575)|
| 0:42:56| Can you go ahead and take it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2576)|
| 0:42:58| The time won't start until you go ahead and write that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2578)|

| 0:43:15| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2595)|
| 0:43:26| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| I believe the gentleman had a concern about the density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2611)|
| 0:43:37| being a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2617)|
| 0:43:38| At five dwelling units per acre, that does fit into your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2618)|
| 0:43:47| sector plan designation for that area, which is medium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2627)|
| 0:43:51| density residential or office for that particular property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2631)|
| 0:43:56| And the planned residential at five units per acre would fall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2636)|
| 0:44:00| within that designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2640)|
| 0:44:06| I feel also that this density would be less impactful than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2646)|
| 0:44:13| most other commercial uses that this property would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2653)|
| 0:44:20| avail itself to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| So I don't have much more to comment on as far as density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2662)|
| 0:44:29| As far as storm water and runoff, I'm in the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2669)|
| 0:44:35| business, and it is my responsibility as a builder to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2675)|
| 0:44:41| control any of the storm water, any water that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| generated by the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2684)|
| 0:44:47| And that is part of the engineering and is part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2687)|
| 0:44:50| building process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2690)|
| 0:44:55| And there are strict inspections regarding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2695)|
| 0:44:59| So I'm held to the Knox County codes as far as drainage and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2699)|
| 0:45:05| storm requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2705)|
| 0:45:06| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2706)|
| 0:45:07| If you want to stay close, because commissioners may have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2707)|
| 0:45:11| a question of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2711)|
| 0:45:12| So if you want to stay close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| Ms. Albertson, would you like to lend any more comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2714)|
| 0:45:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2719)|
| 0:45:20| As Mr. Growl noted, if we look at the sector plan for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2720)|
| 0:45:24| area, which is the long range land use plan, this is located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2724)|
| 0:45:28| within 1,000 feet of the North Cedar Bluff Road and Middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2728)|
| 0:45:33| Brook Pike intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2733)|
| 0:45:36| It is designated as a community commercial area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2736)|
| 0:45:40| And then this specific parcel sort of bleeding out into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2740)|
| 0:45:43| more low density residential uses, we stagger from more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2743)|
| 0:45:47| intense commercial uses, generally using medium density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2747)|
| 0:45:51| residential and office before we transition to low density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2751)|
| 0:45:55| residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2755)|
| 0:45:56| Since this is adjacent to commercial areas, it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2756)|
| 0:46:02| appropriate for medium density residential and office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2762)|
| 0:46:06| As Mr. Growl noted, his density request falls within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2766)|
| 0:46:09| that, and his proposed use, he's noted, is senior housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2769)|
| 0:46:15| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2775)|
| 0:46:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2776)|
| 0:46:17| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2777)|
| 0:46:18| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| Based on the project is consistent with the sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2780)|
| 0:46:23| plan, I will make a motion to approve PR plan residential at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2783)|
| 0:46:27| five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2787)|
| 0:46:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2789)|
| 0:46:30| We have a motion by Commissioner Phillips, a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2790)|
| 0:46:32| second by Commissioner Clancy to approve the planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2792)|
| 0:46:35| residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2795)|
| 0:46:36| Commissioner Clancy, your light was on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| I'm good now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2798)|
| 0:46:43| Commissioner Graf?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2803)|
| 0:46:44| No, his light was on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2804)|
| 0:46:46| It was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2806)|
| 0:46:47| He made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2807)|
| 0:46:48| No, Commissioner Phillips made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2810)|
| 0:46:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2811)|
| 0:46:52| What exactly is senior housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2812)|
| 0:46:56| Mr. Graf, could you answer that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2816)|
| 0:46:59| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| There are various forms of senior housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2821)|
| 0:47:02| There are assisted living, which the gentleman referred to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2822)|
| 0:47:06| This would be falling under the heading of assisted living, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2826)|
| 0:47:09| it is senior independent living, where there would be no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2829)|
| 0:47:14| medications dispensed, no nursing facility or doctors on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2834)|
| 0:47:20| staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2840)|
| 0:47:21| It is not licensed by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| Is there an age limit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2843)|
| 0:47:26| Do you have to be 55 to move in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2846)|
| 0:47:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2848)|
| 0:47:29| Do you have to be 55 and over to move in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2849)|
| 0:47:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2851)|
| 0:47:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2852)|
| 0:47:33| Well, that's even less impact then because a lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2853)|
| 0:47:37| don't go out before 930 in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2857)|
| 0:47:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2864)|
| 0:47:45| We end by 630, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2865)|
| 0:47:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2869)|
| 0:47:50| We have a motion by Commissioner Phillips, a second by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2870)|
| 0:47:53| Commissioner Clancy to approve up to five dwelling units per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2873)|
| 0:47:56| acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2876)|
| 0:47:57| I see no more lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2877)|
| 0:47:59| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2879)|
| 0:48:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2880)|
| 0:48:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2881)|
| 0:48:02| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2882)|
| 0:48:03| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2883)|
| 0:48:04| Mr. Sullivan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2884)|
| 0:48:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2885)|
| 0:48:06| Mr. Sullivan, there is a regulation with the stormwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2886)|

| 0:48:33| and keep in touch with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2913)|
| 0:48:36| And additionally, Mr. Sullivan, as a planned residential zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2916)|
| 0:48:40| the development plan would have to come back to this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=2920)|

| 0:50:40| I live at 1635 Old Andy's Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3040)|
| 0:50:43| I've been there since 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3043)|

| 0:50:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3052)|
| 0:50:53| In regards to this item, rezoning the rear one-half of the farm, 17 acres at 1617 Andy's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3053)|
| 0:50:59| Road from agricultural to planned residential 4.5, I recommend denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3059)|
| 0:51:06| 1617 Andy's Road property is adjoining 30 acres at 1609 Old Andy's Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3066)|
| 0:51:12| The property at 1609 Old Andy's Road was approved for rezoning in September planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3072)|
| 0:51:18| meeting for three dwelling units per acre, and then changed to four dwelling units per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3078)|
| 0:51:23| acre in October by the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3083)|
| 0:51:28| This applicant has expressed the property at 1617 Andy's Road and the property at 1609| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3088)|
| 0:51:34| Old Andy's Road will be developed together as part of the same development with sole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3094)|
| 0:51:38| access from Old Andy's Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3098)|
| 0:51:43| I would recommend approval with the following change, amendment to 2.68 dwelling units per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3103)|
| 0:51:49| acre in line with what the staff is recommending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3109)|
| 0:51:53| And this is for their reasons and also to my original reasons for the recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3113)|
| 0:52:00| for the applicant's request rezoning of the 30 acres from two months ago at 1609 Old Andy's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3120)|
| 0:52:06| Road from agricultural to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3126)|
| 0:52:14| The intersection at Chirp Pit and Andy's Road is dangerous intersection, but we cannot handle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3134)|
| 0:52:19| additional traffic result from this rezoning, a total of 47 acres at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3139)|
| 0:52:25| I believe increased traffic on Andy's Road caused the rezoning of this subject property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3145)|
| 0:52:31| is not desirable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3151)|
| 0:52:32| Andy's Road is way too narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3152)|
| 0:52:35| Old Andy's Road, the property in which the 30 acre plus the additional 17 acres will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3155)|
| 0:52:38| be located on is narrow, a very narrow one lane, one third mile long that the staff has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3158)|
| 0:52:48| pointed out that only has a right of way of 13 feet over part of this length.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3168)|
| 0:52:56| It's also out of character with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3176)|
| 0:52:59| All the surrounding units, the higher density is three dwelling units per acre and the seeds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3179)|
| 0:53:05| are also surrounded by additional agricultural land, which I'm sure will follow suit whenever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3185)|
| 0:53:12| dwelling units per acre is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3192)|
| 0:53:17| Finally, the 17 acres attached to the original 30 acres is very hilly, steep, has two farm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3197)|
| 0:53:27| ponds and a sinkhole on an adjoining property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3207)|
| 0:53:31| I just think it cannot handle the 4.5 dwelling units per acre that is being proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3211)|
| 0:53:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3219)|
| 0:53:40| Ma'am, you've got a couple of minutes there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3220)|

| 0:54:37| to Middlebrook?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3277)|
| 0:54:39| Have you experienced the dangerous intersection of Chert Pit and Andy's Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3279)|
| 0:54:44| Do you know that Old Andy's Road is 7 feet wide and it's barely paved and there are houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3284)|
| 0:54:49| right on the edge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3289)|
| 0:54:51| These are rolling farm hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3291)|
| 0:54:55| Has anyone discussed the impact of what this subdivision will do to Cedar Bluff, to Carnes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3295)|
| 0:55:01| and to Hardin Valley Schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3301)|
| 0:55:05| Has there been a traffic study as directed at our last meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3305)|

| 0:55:16| Do you know that there's water in that land that saturates our yards every single rainfall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3316)|
| 0:55:25| Do you know that there's a rogue cow that was abandoned by one of these farmers 10 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3325)|
| 0:55:29| ago and has just been roaming alone and we all take care of her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3329)|
| 0:55:38| I find it really difficult to understand that any reasonable committee member here who loves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3338)|
| 0:55:44| Knox County and the beauty of Knox County can travel that road, can look at this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3344)|
| 0:55:52| and approve four or three units per an acre on this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3352)|
| 0:55:59| We hear that Mr. Hickey has received four acres, even though it was recommended at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3359)|
| 0:56:05| last meeting, three houses per an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3365)|
| 0:56:09| So I just have to ask this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3369)|
| 0:56:16| I ask you, who do you serve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3376)|
| 0:56:17| Do you serve Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3377)|
| 0:56:19| Do you serve the residents of this community or do you serve the builders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3379)|
| 0:56:22| I was heartened and love to see what you just awarded Mr. Dazzle earlier and I appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3382)|
| 0:56:29| to see that humanity here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3389)|

| 0:56:47| Oh, I am so sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3407)|
| 0:56:52| Mr. Valiant, would you like to speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3412)|
| 0:56:55| Somebody left their material up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3415)|
| 0:57:02| What the lady said and the gentleman said is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3422)|
| 0:57:06| This body recommended three on the adjacent 30 acres, recommended three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3426)|
| 0:57:11| County Commission heard from us and heard from traffic engineering and they voted for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3431)|
| 0:57:25| four dwelling units per acre on the adjacent track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3445)|
| 0:57:28| Now, what Ball Homes has agreed to do for the roads is do whatever the traffic study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3448)|
| 0:57:35| indicated that should be done and they are working with traffic engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3455)|
| 0:57:40| So what this development is going to do is it's going to redo the 13-foot narrow road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3460)|
| 0:57:47| or whatever else county engineering determines ought to be done in order for this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3467)|
| 0:57:53| to proceed forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3473)|
| 0:57:57| With regard to the slope analysis that's been done by the staff, I have trouble with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3477)|
| 0:58:10| way it was done because on the 0 to 15 percent slopes, they recommended three dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3490)|
| 0:58:16| per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3496)|
| 0:58:17| That's 12.36 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| It's 0 to 15 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3499)|
| 0:58:22| If you can't put five dwelling units on 0 to 15 percent, when can you do it when you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3502)|
| 0:58:27| doing low density residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3507)|
| 0:58:30| They put their average in three for that 12.36 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3510)|
| 0:58:40| Low density residential allows for one to five and it seems to me that the 2.68 is somewhat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3520)|
| 0:58:47| of an arbitrary number and I'm not sure how they arrived at it, especially in lieu of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3527)|
| 0:58:53| the fact that they're using the three dwelling units per acre on a 0 to 15 percent slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3533)|
| 0:59:01| We think this is a good development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3541)|
| 0:59:03| You guys know Ball Homes is a good developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3543)|
| 0:59:06| They do what they say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3546)|
| 0:59:07| They do a lot to help the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3547)|
| 0:59:08| They've done a lot to help the schools in the area and so we request that this be zoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3548)|
| 0:59:16| at the same density as the adjacent tract of 30 acres at four dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3556)|
| 0:59:29| Thank you, Mr. Fowler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3569)|
| 0:59:30| If you have any questions, Ryan's here and we have people from Ball Homes that can answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3570)|
| 0:59:35| about anything you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3575)|
| 0:59:36| Super.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3576)|
| 0:59:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3577)|
| 0:59:38| Ms. Johnson, now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3578)|
| 0:59:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3581)|
| 0:59:42| So everything that's been stated so far is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3582)|
| 0:59:46| The adjacent property was recommended for rezoning up to three dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3586)|
| 0:59:53| by this potty but then in October at the county commission meeting, they recommended that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3593)|
| 1:00:01| parcel be rezoned for up to four dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3601)|
| 1:00:06| The city staff did run a slope analysis on the back 17 acres that are in question today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3606)|
| 1:00:13| The entire parcel falls within the hillside and ridgetop protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3613)|
| 1:00:20| We looked at three dwelling units an acre, which is what we would recommend even in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3620)|
| 1:00:24| non-hillside areas for the 0 to 15 percent sloped areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3624)|
| 1:00:30| We also designated the same recommended density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3630)|
| 1:00:36| Again, we came out with 2.68 for the recommended density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3636)|
| 1:00:42| Staff last time on the adjacent property also recommended these same numbers for the hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3642)|
| 1:00:51| and non-hillside areas and came up with a density that was what staff recommended at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3651)|
| 1:00:57| that time as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3657)|
| 1:00:59| So the 2.68 is in line with the same rationale for what we recommended for the adjacent property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3659)|
| 1:01:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3667)|
| 1:01:09| I do have one question with regards to the traffic study and perhaps county engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3669)|
| 1:01:14| can answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3674)|
| 1:01:15| Was this additional 17 acres included in that or just the original 32?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3675)|
| 1:01:22| There has been no traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3682)|
| 1:01:24| The traffic study is required as part of the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3684)|
| 1:01:27| The only way they wouldn't have to do a traffic study is if they came in with less than 75| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3687)|
| 1:01:33| lots, which is unlikely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3693)|
| 1:01:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3695)|
| 1:01:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3696)|
| 1:01:37| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3697)|
| 1:01:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3698)|
| 1:01:39| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3699)|
| 1:01:45| I have driven these roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3705)|
| 1:01:47| I actually have never been down Old Andy's Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3707)|
| 1:01:50| It's just too narrow, but I've spent a lot of time in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3710)|
| 1:01:56| We work for the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3716)|
| 1:01:59| We make decisions on what's best for everyone in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3719)|
| 1:02:04| Probably when Mrs. Goldman's subdivision was put in, we heard the same arguments that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3724)|
| 1:02:11| shouldn't put one to three units per acre on this beautiful farmland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3731)|
| 1:02:15| If we did that, nobody in Knoxville would have a place to live and you wouldn't be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3735)|
| 1:02:21| to have one either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| I would like to make a motion that we approve PR plan residential up to three dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3743)|
| 1:02:29| per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3749)|
| 1:02:30| I think that three is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3750)|
| 1:02:31| If City Council knows more about density or has a better opinion, or the County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3751)|
| 1:02:36| a better opinion, then they can bump it to four if they want, but I think three is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3756)|
| 1:02:41| right number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3761)|
| 1:02:42| I'll second Commissioner Clancy's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3762)|
| 1:02:44| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3764)|
| 1:02:48| However, we still have some lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3768)|
| 1:02:50| Commissioner Graf?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3770)|
| 1:02:51| Commissioner Eason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3771)|
| 1:02:53| I think this is similar to the previous property that we heard, I guess, in September, perhaps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3773)|
| 1:03:00| or October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3780)|
| 1:03:01| I think that the staff's recommendation of 2.68 is correct on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3781)|
| 1:03:06| Looking at the other parcels, some other things that we heard earlier today, I think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3786)|
| 1:03:11| appropriate to have higher density on parcels that are on Middlebrook Pike or on Emory Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3791)|
| 1:03:16| or on flat parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3796)|
| 1:03:19| This parcel is completely in the hillside protection area, and so I do think it's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3799)|
| 1:03:23| that we use the hillside protection charts as our guidelines and would stick with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3803)|
| 1:03:30| 2.68.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3810)|
| 1:03:31| Commissioner Roth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3811)|
| 1:03:32| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3812)|
| 1:03:33| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3813)|
| 1:03:34| I agree with the three units per acre because it's kind of consistent with what's around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3814)|
| 1:03:41| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3821)|
| 1:03:43| But also, one of the things I think about when I'm looking at this property, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3823)|
| 1:03:47| when there is a traffic study, there's going to have to be some work done to the intersections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3827)|
| 1:03:52| at Andes, and the roads are going to have to be improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3832)|
| 1:03:55| So I think that's a benefit for everybody around the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3835)|
| 1:03:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3839)|
| 1:04:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3840)|
| 1:04:02| I see no other lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3842)|
| 1:04:04| We had a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Phillips to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3844)|
| 1:04:08| planned residential up to three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3848)|
| 1:04:13| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3853)|
| 1:04:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3854)|

| 1:04:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3857)|
| 1:04:20| Can we do a roll call, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3860)|
| 1:04:25| Commissioner Boyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3865)|

| 1:04:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3894)|
| 1:04:55| The motion carries 10 to 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3895)|
| 1:05:03| And the folks that are here from the community, as Mr. Green had mentioned previously, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3903)|
| 1:05:11| is only the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3911)|
| 1:05:13| This will come back before us with a concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3913)|
| 1:05:16| And I imagine, County Engineering, would you, once there is a concept plan, I'm assuming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3916)|
| 1:05:23| that it will include both tracts, so the traffic study will include the entire parcel development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3923)|
| 1:05:31| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3931)|
| 1:05:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3932)|
| 1:05:33| So we'll look forward to hearing back from you again once the concept plan is presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3933)|
| 1:05:46| Next on our agenda is item number 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3946)|
| 1:05:51| And Commissioner Smith is recusing on this particular agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3951)|
| 1:06:00| I'm going to give just a bit for the room to settle down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3960)|
| 1:06:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3967)|
| 1:06:11| The subdivision is the Glen at West Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3971)|
| 1:06:14| The applicant developer is Knox TL.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=3974)|

| 1:06:51| Also to approve the development plan for up to 64 detached dwelling units on individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4011)|

| 1:07:02| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4022)|
| 1:07:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4023)|
| 1:07:04| There are several folks in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4024)|
| 1:07:07| And have you guys got a spokesperson, or are you going to share the time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4027)|
| 1:07:13| I have no idea who's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4033)|

| 1:07:33| I'd like to go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4053)|
| 1:07:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4055)|

| 1:07:45| I'm here on behalf of the applicant, Knox TL.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4065)|
| 1:07:49| As this body's aware, as the members of this commission are aware, this is phase two of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4069)|
| 1:07:55| the residential subdivision that went at West Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4075)|
| 1:08:00| Back in January 2017, January 23rd of 2017, Knox County Commission approved the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4080)|
| 1:08:08| of this tract to PR with the-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4088)|
| 1:08:10| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4090)|
| 1:08:11| Mr. Forrester, could you pull the microphone a little bit closer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4091)|
| 1:08:16| Knox County Commission approved the rezoning to plan residential up to three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4096)|
| 1:08:24| This is, again, just phase two of this residential subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4104)|
| 1:08:30| It was always intended to be phase two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4110)|
| 1:08:34| There was some opposition at the beginning of phase one, and that was resolved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4114)|
| 1:08:39| and that's been developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4119)|
| 1:08:41| I believe some of the opposition, at least I'm familiar with one of the people objecting to the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4121)|
| 1:08:48| is a tract that neighbors the northwest side of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4128)|
| 1:08:54| I believe the objection I understand from MPC staff there is based on the peripheral setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4134)|
| 1:09:00| The subdivision guidelines for this development require a peripheral setback of 35 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4140)|
| 1:09:06| which the development plan does provide for the 35-foot setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4146)|
| 1:09:12| I believe the opposition there or the objection there is that that property owner wants there to be more setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4152)|
| 1:09:20| I would point out that I believe for the improvements on that tract, the peripheral,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4160)|
| 1:09:26| I mean, I would submit that that is likely less than 35 feet setback from that peripheral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4166)|
| 1:09:36| And I'd just like to reserve the remaining of my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4176)|
| 1:09:40| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4180)|
| 1:09:41| Until the opposition speaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4181)|
| 1:09:46| Yes, sir, and have you written down your?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4186)|
| 1:09:48| I will do that now as I introduce myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4188)|
| 1:09:50| I'm Bo Sanford, 900 Southgate Street, Suite 2300, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4190)|
| 1:09:55| I'm here with Mr. Rainey Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4195)|
| 1:09:58| If you want to go ahead and write down your name, we'll not start the clock until.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4198)|
| 1:10:23| OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4223)|
| 1:10:24| I'm here today with Mr. Rainey Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4224)|
| 1:10:26| Mr. Smith, as we just pointed out, lives at 740s Ola Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4226)|
| 1:10:30| The house that you see just immediately west of phase two of the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4230)|
| 1:10:35| His house is directly adjacent to what would be lots 30, 93, 94 and 95, as shown on the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4235)|
| 1:10:45| I can press those up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4245)|
| 1:10:54| That concept plan that's going around shows the location of those three lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4254)|
| 1:10:59| We are not here to oppose necessarily the concept plan or its approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4259)|
| 1:11:04| Instead, we do request that a additional condition be placed on the approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4264)|
| 1:11:10| Specifically, we would like to request a 20 foot landscape buffer be added to the western boundary of lots 93, 94 and 95.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4270)|
| 1:11:19| To be clear, Mr. Smith is not asking for the developer to incur any additional cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4279)|
| 1:11:24| In fact, Mr. Smith is willing to plant some vegetation himself, perhaps some Leland cypress trees or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4284)|
| 1:11:31| to form a natural barrier between his home and these three homes that will be built immediately east of him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4291)|
| 1:11:38| As counsel for the applicant has pointed out, the concept plan does contemplate the required 35 foot peripheral setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4298)|
| 1:11:48| To be clear, this would not be in addition to that 35 feet. This would be within the 35 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4308)|
| 1:11:58| Given the proximity of Mr. Smith's home to the buildable areas of lot 93, 94 and 95,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4318)|
| 1:12:05| we think this would be both in his interest and in the interest of those three lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4325)|
| 1:12:10| and preserving the value of those three lots and his lot in creating that natural barrier between the properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4330)|
| 1:12:17| We respectfully ask that the approval of the concept plan for phase two of the subvision be conditioned upon the inclusion of a condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4337)|
| 1:12:26| The condition being a 20 foot landscape buffer on the western portion of lots 93, 94 and 95.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4346)|
| 1:12:33| And I'd like to reserve the rest of our time for others in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4353)|
| 1:12:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4357)|
| 1:12:43| Yes, ma'am. And if you have not yet written down your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4363)|
| 1:12:58| Good afternoon. My name is Sherry Whitaker. My address is 823 Zola Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4378)|
| 1:13:03| I also own 819 Zola Lane, which is the property that's affected by this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4383)|
| 1:13:09| My number one concern is the stormwater drainage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4389)|
| 1:13:13| Currently there's one detention basin at the back of the property, which the entire first phase of the development drains to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4393)|
| 1:13:20| The majority of the second phase will also drain to that pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4400)|
| 1:13:24| I have some concerns about the capacity and design of that detention pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4404)|
| 1:13:29| The creation of so many new paved roads and driveways means that there's going to be a lot of water draining our way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4409)|
| 1:13:39| My family will bear the burden of the failure of that system as the water travels towards Zola Lane and ultimately across our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4419)|
| 1:13:48| During a heavy rain event, if the pond cannot hold all the water, where will that water go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4428)|
| 1:13:53| Whose property do you think will be affected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4433)|
| 1:13:56| We should see no increase in the flow rate across our property due to the development of this subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4436)|
| 1:14:02| And if there's an emergency spillway on that pond, I'd like to know which way that's directed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4442)|
| 1:14:10| The Knox County Stormwater Ordinance Section 4.3.1.5 says that stormwater ponds shall not be located in a stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4450)|
| 1:14:19| If a developer wants a variance from this policy, they must have a Section 404 permit under the Clean Water Act or an aquatic resource alteration permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4459)|
| 1:14:30| This pond is clearly located in the middle of a blue-lined stream as denoted on the KGIS map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4470)|
| 1:14:36| Has the developer obtained those required permits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4476)|
| 1:14:40| The ordinance also says stormwater ponds shall not be located on slopes greater than 15 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4480)|
| 1:14:46| And I'd be interested to know what the slope is where this pond sits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4486)|
| 1:14:50| I've submitted some pictures to you through a letter to show the quality of the water that we and Fort Loudoun Lake have been receiving during the last year and a half of construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4490)|
| 1:15:00| I don't know if you can pull those pictures up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4500)|
| 1:15:03| So that's my issue with the stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4503)|
| 1:15:06| Also, I'd like to note that their common area, amenity area, is located at the mouth of the stormwater pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4506)|
| 1:15:13| I don't think I'd want my children playing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4513)|
| 1:15:16| The second issue that I'd like to bring up is the road improvement promises that were made or were required as a condition of the Phase 1 approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4516)|
| 1:15:30| Condition 1 of the concept plan that was approved in April of 2017 said the developer would improve Millstone Lane to a minimum pavement width of 20 feet as shown on the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4530)|
| 1:15:41| That widening was to start near the development entrance and extend approximately 200 feet east of Frills Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4541)|
| 1:15:47| And while there was some widening in front of the subdivision entrance, if you go to the east of Frills Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4547)|
| 1:15:53| it doesn't appear that what was shown on the concept plan was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4553)|
| 1:15:57| Specifically, the road was supposed to abut all the way next to a wooden fence that's along Millstone Lane, and I was there yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4557)|
| 1:16:06| Clearly, that road is five or six feet off of that fence, so they did not do what that concept plan showed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4566)|
| 1:16:13| And perhaps the developer can speak to whether those improvements were made or why they were not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4573)|
| 1:16:19| In summary, before you approve this plan, I ask that you be sure that the stormwater basin is sufficient to contain all the water that will be generated by this expansion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4579)|
| 1:16:28| that all the applicable permits have been obtained, and that all other requirements of the Knox County Stormwater Ordinance have been met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4588)|
| 1:16:36| I also ask that no further development be approved unless the required roadwork conditions of Phase 1 have been met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4596)|
| 1:16:42| Thank you. The community depends on Knox County Government to enforce the conditions of an approved plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4602)|
| 1:16:48| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4608)|
| 1:16:51| Madam Chair, I'd like to request some more time for the opposition so she can be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4611)|
| 1:16:57| Thank you. How much more time would you like? Two minutes? Three minutes? Two minutes. Ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4617)|
| 1:17:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4622)|
| 1:17:04| My name is Kim Thomas. I live at 711 Valley Glen Boulevard, Phase 1 of the Glenette West Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4624)|
| 1:17:26| I'm not in objection to the approval, but I am asking that the committee please take a look at the compliance of the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4646)|
| 1:17:33| to provide all utility services to Phase 2, because we were not provided all utility services in Phase 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4653)|
| 1:17:39| I'm talking about residential mail service, basic mail service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4659)|
| 1:17:44| Not one resident in Phase 1 receives any residential mail service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4664)|
| 1:17:49| This commission approved Phase 1 during their final plaque approval on December 13, 2018,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4669)|
| 1:17:55| and I am afraid that we are not exercising due diligence by approving this plaque without utility service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4675)|
| 1:18:02| I am concerned that the Commissioner Smith and Eric Mosley are knowingly failing to apply for and provide for simple basic residential service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4682)|
| 1:18:10| We are not being served. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4690)|
| 1:18:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4694)|
| 1:18:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4697)|
| 1:18:22| Applicant, you have some additional time reserved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4702)|
| 1:18:31| To address some of the opposition's comments, first as to the landscape buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4711)|
| 1:18:37| my dealings with NPC staff and my understanding is that staff does not require landscape buffers and residential subdivisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4717)|
| 1:18:45| such as that that's being requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4725)|
| 1:18:47| Again, this peripheral kind of setback isn't a setback necessarily for a landscape buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4727)|
| 1:18:57| That is the developer's property on there, and that will be some residential homeowner's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4737)|
| 1:19:04| It is created to create some separation between the improvements on these adjacent tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4744)|
| 1:19:11| Again, it's not necessarily required or intended for every 35-foot setback to necessarily be a landscape buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4751)|
| 1:19:20| In regard to the stormwater, as is required on the approval or certain conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4760)|
| 1:19:28| and even outside of those conditions, the developer is going to have to comply with Knox County Stormwater Ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4768)|
| 1:19:34| and the developer will comply with Knox County Stormwater Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4774)|
| 1:19:38| Likewise, the developer is going to have to get Knox County Department of Engineering approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4778)|
| 1:19:44| which will be reviewing these stormwater plans and the detention basin plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4784)|
| 1:19:49| and determining the runoffs and the water flows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4789)|
| 1:19:53| The developer will, again, have to comply and meet all those requirements to proceed with this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4793)|
| 1:19:58| In regard to the comment of this being a blue-line stream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4798)|
| 1:20:01| my understanding is that in phase one that that potential issue was studied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4801)|
| 1:20:06| and it was determined that this was not, in fact, a blue-line stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4806)|
| 1:20:10| It was essentially a drainage ditch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4810)|
| 1:20:12| I know the developer's engineer is here and can probably speak further on that more competently than I can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4812)|
| 1:20:17| should this body wish to hear from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4817)|
| 1:20:22| So at this time we request that the NPC Commission approve the proposed concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4822)|
| 1:20:29| and the development plan subject to the conditions of NPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4829)|
| 1:20:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4833)|
| 1:20:37| Mr. Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4837)|
| 1:20:38| I have one comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4838)|
| 1:20:39| I believe Ms. Thomas talked about the lack of utilities, specifically mail service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4839)|
| 1:20:45| I understand that Mr. Mosley may be able to speak more to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4845)|
| 1:20:49| but the Postal Service has at times in the middle of developments advised the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4849)|
| 1:20:57| that the only way of receiving mail service is through a cluster mailbox unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4857)|
| 1:21:03| which was not planned for because the developer was not made aware of that prior to the initiation of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4863)|
| 1:21:09| So I think Mr. Mosley is in a tough position with the Postal Service at this time, like other developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4869)|
| 1:21:16| and we're working, developers, some planning staff, the Area Association of Realtors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4876)|
| 1:21:22| and others are trying to work with the Postal Service to come to some type of resolution with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4882)|
| 1:21:28| We're sorry for that inconvenience, but it's something that we have no control over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4888)|
| 1:21:33| and I doubt if Mr. Mosley or other developers have much control over either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4893)|
| 1:21:40| Sir, did you have something to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4900)|
| 1:21:42| Yeah, I was going to add my name is Eric Mosley, 405 Mountain Brook Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4902)|
| 1:21:46| The mail service apparently is now implementing in normal subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4906)|
| 1:21:50| that there be installed central delivery units inside the development for the people's mail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4910)|
| 1:21:56| and we are currently in the process of putting one in, phase one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4916)|
| 1:22:00| We hadn't planned for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4920)|
| 1:22:01| We have installed mailboxes at all of our residences, homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4921)|
| 1:22:05| and the mail people will not deliver the mail, and this is an ongoing situation all over Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4925)|
| 1:22:11| and it's being battled at the state level politically, but we're not going to wait on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4931)|
| 1:22:16| We're going to go ahead and put a CPU unit in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4936)|
| 1:22:18| One of the partners actually met with the post office today to figure out a location for that unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4938)|
| 1:22:23| and there will be a unit for phase two as well, so that should solve that mail issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4943)|
| 1:22:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4951)|
| 1:22:32| If there's any other questions, I'd be glad to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4952)|
| 1:22:35| Stay close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4955)|
| 1:22:36| Ma'am, you still do have some time left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4956)|
| 1:22:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4959)|
| 1:22:40| I would respectfully ask Mr. Mosley for details on that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4960)|
| 1:22:44| This is not a new law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4964)|
| 1:22:45| This is not a state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4965)|
| 1:22:46| This is a federal law that was passed in 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4966)|
| 1:22:50| It is on your guidelines, the Knox County Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4970)|
| 1:22:53| that all utility services will be provided before a final plat is issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4973)|
| 1:22:58| You approved the final plat for phase one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4978)|
| 1:23:00| And we do not consider mail service as a utility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4980)|
| 1:23:03| It is listed on the item as all utilities, including mail, on your guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4983)|
| 1:23:08| That was amended September 12, 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4988)|
| 1:23:11| I agree, and I hear Mr. Mosley, and I appreciate him installing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4991)|
| 1:23:15| I would like to know the details, and I'd be happy to share those with everyone in the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4995)|
| 1:23:19| as if he wants to share them, including myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=4999)|
| 1:23:22| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5002)|
| 1:23:23| I do not see anything on the phase two for any plan for that either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5003)|
| 1:23:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5008)|
| 1:23:30| Mr. Breschke, do you have anything that you would like to add before we go to commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5010)|
| 1:23:38| On the issue of amenity, there was an amenity area that was identified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5018)|
| 1:23:44| basically adjacent to the stormwater facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5024)|
| 1:23:49| It's a small area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5029)|
| 1:23:50| We had recommended to the applicant that they look at finding additional amenity area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5030)|
| 1:23:56| that can be used by the neighborhood, and we have talked to them about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5036)|
| 1:24:00| It's not a condition of the approval, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5040)|
| 1:24:03| As the comment had been made earlier about the issue of buffer requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5043)|
| 1:24:09| as a rule we have not recommended or required any kind of landscape buffer between single-family homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5049)|
| 1:24:15| single-family development adjacent to single-family property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5055)|
| 1:24:18| If it was an attached or multi-dwelling development, we would have some type of recommendation on buffering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5058)|
| 1:24:26| But when you do it on the individual homes, it becomes an enforcement issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5066)|
| 1:24:30| because once somebody builds their home and they go out there and start to thin out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5070)|
| 1:24:34| or clear out the backyard, it becomes more of an enforcement problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5074)|
| 1:24:40| Engineering is here to respond to any of the stormwater or road issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5080)|
| 1:24:45| Great. Commissioner Newton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5085)|
| 1:24:47| Yeah, the question I have is directly related to that buffer question for Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5087)|
| 1:24:57| Somebody just brought us a copy of the grading plan, and it appears to me that on those lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5097)|
| 1:25:04| 93, 94, and 95, 94 and 95 do not look to me like there's any new grading lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5104)|
| 1:25:12| that go into that peripheral setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5112)|
| 1:25:15| It looks like on lot 93, there's only about five feet of that 35 feet that looks to me like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5115)|
| 1:25:25| it's showing new grades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5125)|
| 1:25:26| And I'm curious if Mr. Mosley would entertain not clearing in that peripheral setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5126)|
| 1:25:34| in lieu of not having to do a buffer or any other new plantings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5134)|
| 1:25:38| I find it, if you try to go in there and clear and thin out and do buffers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5138)|
| 1:25:43| you're going to make a bigger mess than you would have if you just left it the way it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5143)|
| 1:25:46| And it looked to me like on the aerial that that part of the property was wooded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5146)|
| 1:25:50| Is that fair? No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5150)|
| 1:25:52| Yeah, I mean, if the grading ends up taking the form that's on that plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5152)|
| 1:25:56| then obviously we would not be in the area that we're even talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5156)|
| 1:26:01| It costs a lot of money to clear and get rid of the brush and how that stuff goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5161)|
| 1:26:06| but it's hard to have a commitment of something up front not knowing exactly how it's going to end up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5166)|
| 1:26:13| Well, maybe we don't do the whole 35 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5173)|
| 1:26:15| but you might want to consider doing a non-disturbance buffer at least 20 feet or so to protect that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5175)|
| 1:26:28| That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5188)|
| 1:26:30| Commissioner Clancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5190)|
| 1:26:35| I don't know how you make commitments on grading until you're out there grading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5195)|
| 1:26:42| but can Mr. Smith not plant a buffer in his backyard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5202)|
| 1:26:48| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5208)|
| 1:26:50| If I may, Mr. Smith, as you can see, and the topo doesn't show up entirely on the screen there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5210)|
| 1:26:58| but due to the lay of the land and the situation of his improvements, there's not a great deal of room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5218)|
| 1:27:03| There's a bit of a steep hill there that you see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5223)|
| 1:27:08| and I don't think there's sufficient room for those type of trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5228)|
| 1:27:13| or any type of planting to go in there retroactively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5233)|
| 1:27:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5237)|
| 1:27:18| And I'd also like to hear what Mr. Mosley's engineer has to say about the blue line stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5238)|
| 1:27:27| It looks like one, but maybe it is just a ditch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5247)|
| 1:27:29| You said your engineer is here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5249)|
| 1:27:34| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5254)|
| 1:27:38| A nice lady outside asked me if I was intending to speak, and I said not unless I have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5258)|
| 1:27:42| That's why I called for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5262)|
| 1:27:57| My name is David Campbell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5277)|
| 1:27:58| I'm with my company's Ideal Engineering Solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5278)|
| 1:28:01| We prepare the phase one designs for phase one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5281)|
| 1:28:04| Sorry, just to read into the record your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5284)|
| 1:28:07| Oh, I'm sorry, 325 Wooded Lane, Knoxville, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5287)|
| 1:28:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5291)|
| 1:28:12| I'm the engineer of record for the phase one of Glen at West Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5292)|
| 1:28:16| and I'll be the engineer of record for the phase two as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5296)|
| 1:28:19| The stream, I'm not a consulting biologist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5299)|
| 1:28:22| but a consulting biologist visited the site and prepared a report, which was presented to the TDEC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5302)|
| 1:28:28| which identified that the water course passing through the site was actually what is considered a wet weather conveyance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5308)|
| 1:28:34| which means it is not a blue line stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5314)|
| 1:28:36| So I did not personally prepare that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5316)|
| 1:28:38| but I can attest to the fact that it was submitted to Knox County and to the TDC and accepted by them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5318)|
| 1:28:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5325)|
| 1:28:48| Commissioner Easton, your light was on, and that answers the question that I was going to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5328)|
| 1:28:53| Okay. Commissioner Graf?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5333)|
| 1:28:55| I'd like to go back to the mailbox issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5335)|
| 1:29:00| I think that we don't have any influence, really, with the federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5340)|
| 1:29:08| If they're not going to deliver the mail, except on their terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5348)|
| 1:29:14| then it's up to the residents of the community to go after them and get a rule change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5354)|
| 1:29:24| or whatever it is they need to do, but I don't see where it concerns us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5364)|
| 1:29:31| And I think that the fact that the developer did install mailboxes on Unit 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5371)|
| 1:29:39| and the post office refuses to use them kind of takes it out of our hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5379)|
| 1:29:46| That's a different issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5386)|
| 1:29:48| I don't think we should be considering that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5388)|
| 1:29:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5394)|
| 1:29:56| I did have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5396)|
| 1:29:58| I believe it was Ms. Whitaker, I think, that had mentioned something about road improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5398)|
| 1:30:06| that were supposed to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5406)|
| 1:30:10| If you will pull up the concept plan, I don't know if you have the ability to do that, from April of 2017,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5410)|
| 1:30:16| you'll see where there was to be an expansion of the pavement east of Frills Lane toward the middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5416)|
| 1:30:25| The pavement was supposed to be extended several feet back, like I said, all the way to that fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5425)|
| 1:30:30| It showed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5430)|
| 1:30:31| Actually, the pavement looked like it was going to be abutted right next to that fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5431)|
| 1:30:35| There was a utility pole that was to be taken out right across from the entrance to Frills Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5435)|
| 1:30:40| and the pavement was supposed to extend behind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5440)|
| 1:30:43| And I took a picture of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5443)|
| 1:30:45| It does not look like that power pole was moved and the pavement goes in front of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5445)|
| 1:30:50| so it does not look like that pavement was extended as per the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5450)|
| 1:30:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5456)|
| 1:30:57| I think they're still working on bringing that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5457)|
| 1:30:58| Mr. Mosley, can you address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5458)|
| 1:31:00| I can show you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5460)|
| 1:31:01| Maybe you'll see what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5461)|
| 1:31:06| There's that power pole that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5466)|
| 1:31:10| I believe we were required to install a plan that was designed by David Campbell, and it was 20 feet of asphalt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5470)|
| 1:31:17| I'm pretty sure that what we have out there is what was on the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5477)|
| 1:31:21| I don't know where that pole was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5481)|
| 1:31:23| That pole is the same pole that was there that said was going to be relocated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5483)|
| 1:31:27| I think they set a new pole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5487)|
| 1:31:29| The plan shows that the road goes all the way up to that fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5489)|
| 1:31:34| But that's not the same pole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5494)|
| 1:31:35| Did the fence get moved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5495)|
| 1:31:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5496)|
| 1:31:37| Those houses along Millstone Lines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5497)|
| 1:31:39| Yes, that fence was replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5499)|
| 1:31:40| Those wood fences?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5500)|
| 1:31:41| This is not the same pole that was in there before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5501)|
| 1:31:43| That's a new pole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5503)|
| 1:31:46| They pulled the old pole and put a new pole in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5506)|
| 1:31:48| There's 20 feet of asphalt there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5508)|
| 1:31:50| It showed that the asphalt was to go up to those wooden fences along Millstone Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5510)|
| 1:31:55| Are you telling me those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5515)|
| 1:31:56| The asphalt never went to the fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5516)|
| 1:31:58| Can anyone pull the plan up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5518)|
| 1:32:01| There's a concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5521)|
| 1:32:04| I have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5524)|
| 1:32:05| I can show you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5525)|
| 1:32:08| Mr. Breschke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5528)|
| 1:32:11| May I answer that from county engineering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5531)|
| 1:32:16| Ms. Williams' e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5536)|
| 1:32:21| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5541)|
| 1:32:22| Can you hold off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5542)|
| 1:32:23| We're checking with county engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5543)|
| 1:32:26| There have been several e-mails back and forth between Ms. Williams and our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5546)|
| 1:32:31| After one of the e-mails, Steve Elliott, who's over all of our inspectors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5551)|
| 1:32:36| went out to observe the work out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5556)|
| 1:32:39| And he said that the work is in per the approved plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5559)|
| 1:32:43| and he sent an e-mail to Ms. Williams to that effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5563)|
| 1:32:46| Whitaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5566)|
| 1:32:49| Ms. Whitaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5569)|
| 1:32:50| So that Ms. Whitaker had e-mailed recently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5570)|
| 1:32:57| Yes, I did e-mail Mr. Elliott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5577)|
| 1:32:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5579)|
| 1:33:01| Let me get some answers from our engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5581)|
| 1:33:06| So the work is in progress?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5586)|
| 1:33:09| The work is completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5589)|
| 1:33:11| Completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5591)|
| 1:33:12| The road is widened and the sidewalk is in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5592)|
| 1:33:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5594)|
| 1:33:15| So based on engineering, that work is completed as per the concept plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5595)|
| 1:33:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5600)|
| 1:33:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5602)|
| 1:33:23| Mr. Breschke, did you still have something you wanted to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5603)|
| 1:33:25| He's answered that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5605)|
| 1:33:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5606)|
| 1:33:27| So, Ms. Whitaker, it sounds like it was completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5607)|
| 1:33:30| Well, I would ask that someone look at the concept plan that was submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5610)|
| 1:33:34| and see that it shows the pavement goes up to the wooden fence that's along Millstone Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5614)|
| 1:33:40| The pavement is not up to that wooden fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5620)|
| 1:33:42| So I can say it's not – if there's 20 feet of pavement there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5622)|
| 1:33:47| it's not to this design that was shown on the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5627)|
| 1:33:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5630)|
| 1:33:51| I think that that is something that you can go and speak to county engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5631)|
| 1:33:57| I'm looking to Mr. Green for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5637)|
| 1:33:59| I would say also that the concept plan is just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5639)|
| 1:34:02| It's a concept plan, and it shows the general location for improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5642)|
| 1:34:06| Following the concept plan, there's a more detailed engineered design drawings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5646)|
| 1:34:10| and then construction drawings that further refine that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5650)|
| 1:34:13| So we often find slight variations from what's shown on the concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5653)|
| 1:34:18| to those final design and construction drawings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5658)|
| 1:34:22| What we rely on is engineering, public works and engineering staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5662)|
| 1:34:27| inspecting the finished work to make sure it's in compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5667)|
| 1:34:30| with the construction drawings and the approved design plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5670)|
| 1:34:34| Again, the transition from a concept plan, which is just that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5674)|
| 1:34:38| somewhat conceptual to the design and engineering drawings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5678)|
| 1:34:41| and then the actual construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5681)|
| 1:34:43| As county engineering pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5683)|
| 1:34:45| the roads based on the inspection met the requirement of 20 feet in width| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5685)|
| 1:34:50| and the sidewalk placement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5690)|
| 1:34:52| Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5692)|
| 1:34:54| Certainly, Ms. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5694)|
| 1:34:56| It's hard to follow the progression from all those plans, and we apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5696)|
| 1:35:01| I ask if it met the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5701)|
| 1:35:03| That was all I had privy to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5703)|
| 1:35:06| And those design drawings and other plans are available to the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5706)|
| 1:35:11| if you want to look at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5711)|
| 1:35:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5713)|
| 1:35:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5714)|
| 1:35:16| Those would be at county engineering, public works and engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5716)|
| 1:35:19| Ms. Thomas, did you have something quickly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5719)|
| 1:35:21| I would like to address the commissioner's comment about the mail service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5721)|
| 1:35:24| This was approved back in 2017, or the concept plan was then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5724)|
| 1:35:28| There's postal guidelines that the developer must adhere to, not the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5728)|
| 1:35:33| Ms. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5733)|
| 1:35:34| But I don't understand his comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5734)|
| 1:35:35| We have had a presentation by the postal service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5735)|
| 1:35:38| We get training, believe it or not, but we do get some training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5738)|
| 1:35:42| He said it was the resident's responsibility to obtain postal service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5742)|
| 1:35:47| That's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5747)|
| 1:35:48| No, it's the resident's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5748)|
| 1:35:50| It's a federal law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5750)|
| 1:35:53| It's the resident's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5753)|
| 1:35:54| We need to talk to our representatives and tell them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5754)|
| 1:35:59| but we don't have the purveyance to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5759)|
| 1:36:03| But you do have a regulation in your state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5763)|
| 1:36:06| to provide utility services to members of Knox County before you approve the plat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5766)|
| 1:36:11| That's all I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5771)|
| 1:36:13| Take it to your state representative, your senator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5773)|
| 1:36:17| It's a federal law, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5777)|
| 1:36:18| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5778)|
| 1:36:21| It's not a federal law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5781)|
| 1:36:23| It's the guidelines of the U.S. Postal Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5783)|
| 1:36:25| It's not a law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5785)|
| 1:36:26| It's their guidelines for providing mail service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5786)|
| 1:36:29| And, again, we're trying to work with the U.S. Postal Service to reach some resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5789)|
| 1:36:34| And, Mr. Mosley, in your neighborhood with Cotter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5794)|
| 1:36:37| I can only speak personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5797)|
| 1:36:38| I will say one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5798)|
| 1:36:39| I'm in contempt of court, but I did not receive my jury summons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5799)|
| 1:36:42| I'm not talking about mail catalogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5802)|
| 1:36:45| I'm talking about my driver's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5805)|
| 1:36:47| New things that I receive as a new resident, as a homeowner of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5807)|

| 1:38:10| and neither this commission or the county commission or anybody else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399191114part1?start=5890)|
