| 1:58:20| really across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7100)|
| 1:58:22| This shows you that our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7102)|
| 1:58:24| rental rate has been trending down for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7104)|
| 1:58:26| number of years. This is true| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7106)|
| 1:58:28| of the homeowner vacancy rate as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7108)|
| 1:58:30| well, so these are both really good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7110)|
| 1:58:32| indicators of housing demand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7112)|
| 1:58:34| and they're both trending downwards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7114)|
| 1:58:36| meaning our supply is just not simply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7116)|
| 1:58:38| keeping up with the demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7118)|
| 1:58:40| The commercial market is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7120)|
| 1:58:42| despite some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7122)|
| 1:58:44| pretty unfortunate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7124)|
| 1:58:46| conditions in a pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7126)|
| 1:58:48| is still really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7128)|
| 1:58:50| resilient. They're constrained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7130)|
| 1:58:52| but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7132)|
| 1:58:54| the vacancy rate has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7134)|
| 1:58:56| remained really low| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7136)|
| 1:58:58| and down from pre-COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7138)|
| 1:59:00| so overall, Knoxville's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7140)|
| 1:59:02| commercial market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7142)|
| 1:59:04| the outlook is pretty positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7144)|
| 1:59:06| Looking ahead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7146)|
| 1:59:08| the challenge is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7148)|
| 1:59:10| housing shortage, and it's not a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7150)|
| 1:59:12| bubble. I've heard a lot of conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7152)|
| 1:59:14| about a bubble, but there really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7154)|
| 1:59:16| is no indication that a bubble| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7156)|
| 1:59:18| specifically in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7158)|
| 1:59:20| is something that we should be worrying about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7160)|
| 1:59:22| We could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7162)|
| 1:59:24| potentially see a decline in home sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7164)|
| 1:59:26| in the latter half of this year, simply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7166)|
| 1:59:28| because we do not have inventory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7168)|
| 1:59:30| to sustain what we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7170)|
| 1:59:32| doing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7172)|
| 1:59:34| The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7174)|
| 1:59:36| takeaway here is meeting the rising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7176)|
| 1:59:38| demand for housing is really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7178)|
| 1:59:40| critical for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7180)|
| 1:59:42| One, to remain the affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7182)|
| 1:59:44| area that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7184)|
| 1:59:46| brand ourselves as,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7186)|
| 1:59:48| and also to be able to attract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7188)|
| 1:59:50| new talent and investment and retain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7190)|
| 1:59:52| people who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7192)|
| 1:59:54| graduating from UT or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7194)|
| 1:59:56| the ability to attract these big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7196)|
| 1:59:58| companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7198)|
| 2:00:00| These are just some policy recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7200)|
| 2:00:02| that I will gloss over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7202)|
| 2:00:04| Permitting process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7204)|
| 2:00:06| is something that we should always be looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7206)|
| 2:00:08| at to expedite reduced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7208)|
| 2:00:10| fees. Developing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7210)|
| 2:00:12| financial literacy and homeowner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7212)|
| 2:00:14| education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7214)|
| 2:00:16| Developing CTE programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7216)|
| 2:00:18| and trade education that we already have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7218)|
| 2:00:20| but enhancing those. Addressing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7220)|
| 2:00:22| vacant, abandoned properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7222)|
| 2:00:24| Upzoning underutilized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7224)|
| 2:00:26| commercial zones should certainly be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7226)|
| 2:00:28| re-evaluated for use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7228)|
| 2:00:30| as potential housing developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7230)|
| 2:00:32| Expanded transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7232)|
| 2:00:34| public transportation is a great way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7234)|
| 2:00:36| to expand the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7236)|
| 2:00:38| That is all I have, so I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7238)|
| 2:00:40| happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7240)|

| 2:00:54| also just email this to commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7254)|

| 2:00:58| to all the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7258)|

| 2:01:02| happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7262)|

| 2:01:44| start public forum, we had already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7304)|
| 2:01:46| agreed to suspend the rules and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7306)|

| 2:02:14| We already voted to suspend the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7334)|
| 2:02:16| on this one item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7336)|
| 2:02:18| so that's already been voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7338)|

| 2:02:24| consent calendar and the education calendar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7344)|
| 2:02:26| which has been publicly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7346)|
| 2:02:28| available, you are now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7348)|
| 2:02:30| voting on approving both of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7350)|

| 2:02:38| There's a motion. Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7358)|

| 2:03:02| public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7382)|
| 2:03:04| As agreed upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7384)|
| 2:03:06| at the beginning, we will invite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7386)|
| 2:03:08| people to speak for three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7388)|
| 2:03:10| We'll start a timer on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7390)|
| 2:03:12| board up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7392)|
| 2:03:14| We have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7394)|
| 2:03:16| lengthy list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7396)|
| 2:03:18| I suggest that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7398)|
| 2:03:20| run through this list until...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7400)|
| 2:03:24| We can probably run it right up to zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7404)|
| 2:03:26| unless people want to break before zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7406)|
| 2:03:28| Do we want to break before zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7408)|

| 2:04:04| responding to all my emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7444)|

| 2:04:08| We need more like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7448)|
| 2:04:10| This has been a long process and I will keep my remarks brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7450)|
| 2:04:12| Since July 3rd, Knox County has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7452)|
| 2:04:14| suffered under restrictive mandates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7454)|
| 2:04:16| from the Board of Health. As if COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7456)|
| 2:04:18| was not bad enough, the Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7458)|
| 2:04:20| restrictions and mandates have caused more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7460)|
| 2:04:22| unnecessary suffering, including| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7462)|
| 2:04:24| but not limited to business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7464)|
| 2:04:26| closures and fines, job losses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7466)|
| 2:04:28| kids losing a year of education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7468)|
| 2:04:30| activities and sports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7470)|
| 2:04:32| broken families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7472)|
| 2:04:34| an explosion of mental health issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7474)|
| 2:04:36| including anxiety and depression,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7476)|
| 2:04:38| especially in our younger people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7478)|
| 2:04:40| And worst of all, according to the Knox County Regional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7480)|
| 2:04:42| Forensic Center, this was reported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7482)|
| 2:04:44| by WATE just simply five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7484)|
| 2:04:46| days ago. In 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7486)|
| 2:04:48| Knox County has experienced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7488)|
| 2:04:50| a 70% increase in homicides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7490)|
| 2:04:52| a 30%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7492)|
| 2:04:54| increase in drug overdose deaths,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7494)|
| 2:04:56| and a 14% increase in suicides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7496)|
| 2:04:58| It is well past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7498)|
| 2:05:00| time to remove mandate power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7500)|
| 2:05:02| from the Knox Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7502)|
| 2:05:04| No unaccountable board should have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7504)|
| 2:05:06| mandate power. Not a board of zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7506)|
| 2:05:08| not a board of taxation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7508)|
| 2:05:10| and certainly not a board of health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7510)|
| 2:05:12| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7512)|
| 2:05:14| Thank you, Mr. Cunningham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7514)|

| 2:05:26| are you with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7526)|
| 2:05:30| If you would, please approach the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7530)|
| 2:05:32| I believe there's a microphone there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7532)|
| 2:05:34| If you would please state your name and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7534)|
| 2:05:36| Oh, I'm sorry. Rebecca Reeves is up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7536)|
| 2:05:38| first. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7538)|
| 2:05:40| She's coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7540)|
| 2:05:42| down. Okay. Ms. Garrett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7542)|
| 2:05:44| we'll go ahead and start with you while she's making her way down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7544)|
| 2:05:46| If you would, please state your name and your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7546)|
| 2:05:48| county of residence, and you have three minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7548)|
| 2:05:50| please. My name is Sherry Garrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7550)|
| 2:05:52| I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7552)|
| 2:05:54| I have a speech prepared, but I'm not going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7554)|
| 2:05:56| to use it. It's very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7556)|
| 2:05:58| simple. I think it's very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7558)|
| 2:06:00| interesting that this week is the week that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7560)|
| 2:06:02| has brought forth this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7562)|
| 2:06:04| to a month ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7564)|
| 2:06:06| on removing the powers of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7566)|
| 2:06:08| the Board of Health. Easter week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7568)|
| 2:06:10| Today is Holy Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7570)|
| 2:06:12| It's the day after Palm Sunday when Jesus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7572)|
| 2:06:14| rose into Jerusalem, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7574)|
| 2:06:16| they shouted his praises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7576)|
| 2:06:18| and raised palm leaves at him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7578)|
| 2:06:20| This is Holy Monday, and guess what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7580)|
| 2:06:22| happened on Holy Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7582)|
| 2:06:24| Jesus cleared the temple. He was angry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7584)|
| 2:06:26| because of all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7586)|
| 2:06:28| stuff that was going on in the temple,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7588)|
| 2:06:30| and he cleared it. But he also talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7590)|
| 2:06:32| about faith. He talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7592)|
| 2:06:34| about the faith of the mustard seed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7594)|
| 2:06:36| And right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7596)|
| 2:06:38| I have that faith that you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7598)|
| 2:06:40| are going to do the right thing tonight and remove the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7600)|
| 2:06:42| powers of the Board of Health. And that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7602)|
| 2:06:44| all I have. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7604)|
| 2:06:46| Thank you, Ms. Garrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7606)|
| 2:06:48| Ms. Reeves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7608)|
| 2:06:50| Rebecca Reeves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7610)|
| 2:06:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7612)|
| 2:06:54| In the on-deck circle, Debbie Stafford,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7614)|
| 2:06:56| Christine Cruz, Vernon Henry, and Kathy Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7616)|
| 2:07:00| Ms. Reeves, if you would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7620)|
| 2:07:02| please state your name and your county of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7622)|
| 2:07:04| residence, and you have three minutes to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7624)|
| 2:07:06| the Commission. Okay. Well, my name is Rebecca| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7626)|
| 2:07:08| Reeves, and I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7628)|
| 2:07:10| And first of all, I just want to say thank you for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7630)|
| 2:07:12| time to be here. Put it down a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7632)|
| 2:07:14| Better? Okay. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7634)|
| 2:07:16| I just want to say to start off, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7636)|
| 2:07:18| here we are again to talk about the Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7638)|
| 2:07:20| of Health. But to me, it seems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7640)|
| 2:07:22| that we mostly talk about a board and not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7642)|
| 2:07:24| about health. And I want to remind the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7644)|
| 2:07:26| of Knox County that our pandemic has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7646)|
| 2:07:28| not ever been close to that of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7648)|
| 2:07:30| New York, California, and etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7650)|
| 2:07:32| We are not even in the same ballpark as them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7652)|
| 2:07:34| And according to our own Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7654)|
| 2:07:36| Health Department website, zero| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7656)|
| 2:07:38| children between the ages of 0 to 17| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7658)|
| 2:07:40| have died in COVID in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7660)|
| 2:07:42| In the age group of 18 through 44,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7662)|
| 2:07:44| there have only been 11 deaths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7664)|
| 2:07:46| this whole year. And all of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7666)|
| 2:07:48| in spite of the fact that we were a COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7668)|
| 2:07:50| hotspot for cases at one point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7670)|
| 2:07:52| The death numbers in our elderly population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7672)|
| 2:07:54| are higher, but still remarkably low,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7674)|
| 2:07:56| especially compared to the states I mentioned before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7676)|
| 2:07:58| Neighboring counties and states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7678)|
| 2:08:00| without boards of health and without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7680)|
| 2:08:02| mandates have fared just as well, if not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7682)|
| 2:08:04| better than us. Today, I listened to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7684)|
| 2:08:06| a Dr. Ryan Cole, who is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7686)|
| 2:08:08| a Mayo-trained, board-certified pathologist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7688)|
| 2:08:10| immunology and virology specialist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7690)|
| 2:08:12| He said a pandemic is a lack of vitamin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=7692)|

| 2:19:14| This resolution is about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8354)|
| 2:19:16| preserving our form of government and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8356)|
| 2:19:18| the American way of life. Here in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8358)|
| 2:19:20| America, we live in what is called a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8360)|
| 2:19:22| constitutional representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8362)|

| 2:19:28| In that, that means we have a constitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8368)|
| 2:19:30| that provides the framework which we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8370)|
| 2:19:32| all under, from the president down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8372)|
| 2:19:34| to the very lowest worker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8374)|
| 2:19:36| and I hate using that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8376)|
| 2:19:38| phrase, but basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8378)|
| 2:19:40| what it means for us is that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8380)|
| 2:19:42| the citizens elect representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8382)|
| 2:19:44| who then are charged by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8384)|
| 2:19:46| our constitution to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8386)|
| 2:19:48| pass laws and to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8388)|
| 2:19:50| write laws and then to pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8390)|
| 2:19:52| them. And in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8392)|
| 2:19:54| that, it means also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8394)|
| 2:19:56| that not only do the representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8396)|
| 2:19:58| pass the laws, but it also makes them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8398)|
| 2:20:00| accountable to the citizens they represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8400)|
| 2:20:02| Now it's attributed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8402)|
| 2:20:04| to Ben Franklin that he said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8404)|
| 2:20:06| this quote when asked what kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8406)|
| 2:20:08| government we had, he said a republic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8408)|
| 2:20:10| if you can keep it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8410)|
| 2:20:12| And if 2020 has taught| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8412)|
| 2:20:14| us anything, that little biggest word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8414)|
| 2:20:16| in the English language is indeed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8416)|
| 2:20:18| a big if.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8418)|
| 2:20:20| And if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8420)|
| 2:20:22| we are going to keep our republic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8422)|
| 2:20:24| we cannot have unelected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8424)|
| 2:20:26| and therefore unaccountable bureaucracies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8426)|
| 2:20:28| writing and passing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8428)|
| 2:20:30| laws. When we have that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8430)|
| 2:20:32| if we go down that road, we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8432)|
| 2:20:34| no longer a representative republic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8434)|
| 2:20:36| Now I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8436)|
| 2:20:38| to say there was a quote, somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8438)|
| 2:20:40| in the health board said something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8440)|
| 2:20:42| that, well, we aren't unaccountable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8442)|
| 2:20:44| we are accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8444)|
| 2:20:46| The point is they are not accountable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8446)|
| 2:20:48| to the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8448)|
| 2:20:50| They might be accountable to the governor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8450)|
| 2:20:52| they might be accountable to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8452)|
| 2:20:54| state legislature, even to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8454)|
| 2:20:56| county commission, but they're not accountable to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8456)|
| 2:20:58| the county and that is key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8458)|
| 2:21:00| Whoever is writing the laws and enforcing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8460)|
| 2:21:02| the rules needs to be accountable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8462)|
| 2:21:04| to the citizens they represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8464)|
| 2:21:06| And that's really the issue that we're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8466)|
| 2:21:08| about here. So in conclusion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8468)|
| 2:21:10| I believe this resolution needs to be passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8470)|
| 2:21:12| and it needs to be passed immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8472)|

| 2:21:54| to see the people that represent us out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8514)|
| 2:21:56| in the public. I think that's really cool because it's one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8516)|
| 2:21:58| of those things where you're like, they're a group of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8518)|
| 2:22:00| They don't just sit in this meeting every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8520)|
| 2:22:02| I don't have anything prepared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8522)|
| 2:22:04| and I really try to be thoughtful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8524)|
| 2:22:06| and respectful when I speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8526)|

| 2:22:10| But I was talking to my kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8530)|
| 2:22:12| and asking them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8532)|
| 2:22:14| And my oldest brought up to me that about two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8534)|
| 2:22:16| ago we went past the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8536)|
| 2:22:18| anniversary of 15| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8538)|
| 2:22:20| days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8540)|
| 2:22:22| to save the healthcare system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8542)|
| 2:22:26| And he said, so did we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8546)|
| 2:22:28| He'll be 19 on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8548)|
| 2:22:30| And I said, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8550)|
| 2:22:32| as far as I can tell, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8552)|
| 2:22:34| yeah, we did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8554)|
| 2:22:36| He said, well that was our goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8556)|
| 2:22:38| So what are we still doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8558)|
| 2:22:40| I don't have an answer for him anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8560)|
| 2:22:42| I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8562)|
| 2:22:44| that you all have an impossible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8564)|
| 2:22:46| job and I want you to know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8566)|
| 2:22:48| I respect that and I appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8568)|
| 2:22:50| it more than you will ever know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8570)|
| 2:22:52| And I've not told you personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8572)|
| 2:22:54| but I promise you I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8574)|
| 2:22:56| I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8576)|
| 2:22:58| But the one thing I want to make clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8578)|
| 2:23:00| is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8580)|
| 2:23:02| once we pass a line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8582)|
| 2:23:04| of saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8584)|
| 2:23:06| anyone can make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8586)|
| 2:23:08| policy, anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8588)|
| 2:23:10| can make law, anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8590)|
| 2:23:12| can make mandates, we're on a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8592)|
| 2:23:14| slippery slope, regardless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8594)|
| 2:23:16| of a pandemic, regardless of anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8596)|
| 2:23:18| else. We have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8598)|
| 2:23:20| be sure that the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8600)|
| 2:23:22| elected, and that is all of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8602)|
| 2:23:24| that your job, when we elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8604)|
| 2:23:26| you, is to stand for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8606)|
| 2:23:28| our rights, not to give them away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8608)|
| 2:23:30| And we want to be sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8610)|
| 2:23:32| that you know that that's where our heart is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8612)|
| 2:23:34| That's where our heart is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8614)|
| 2:23:36| Because we want to stand for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8616)|
| 2:23:38| We want to stand for our families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8618)|
| 2:23:40| And you know, I told you all that my 81| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8620)|
| 2:23:42| year old mama, and she's still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8622)|
| 2:23:44| kicking, she's still there, she's still mad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8624)|
| 2:23:46| at everybody because she doesn't understand why everybody's so crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8626)|
| 2:23:48| But that's another issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8628)|
| 2:23:50| She continues to say that nobody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8630)|
| 2:23:52| asked the old people or the kids what they wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8632)|
| 2:23:56| We didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8636)|
| 2:23:58| She wanted to hug her family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8638)|
| 2:24:00| She wanted to see her grandchildren happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8640)|
| 2:24:02| And that's what I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8642)|
| 2:24:04| as well. I want you to return| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8644)|
| 2:24:06| the responsibility to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8646)|
| 2:24:08| me. Make things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8648)|
| 2:24:10| optional. Let people decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8650)|
| 2:24:12| Because I think Knoxville is full of some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8652)|
| 2:24:14| really great, good people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8654)|
| 2:24:16| And I think that they make good choices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8656)|
| 2:24:18| for the most part. I hope that you'll do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8658)|
| 2:24:20| the same. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8660)|

| 2:24:38| I'll make it quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8678)|
| 2:24:40| I was listening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8680)|
| 2:24:42| to the Knox County Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8682)|

| 2:24:48| I guess that was the last meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8688)|
| 2:24:50| they had. And this is just a few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8690)|
| 2:24:52| things I picked up from Dr. James| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8692)|
| 2:24:54| Cho. This is raw data coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8694)|
| 2:24:56| from the medical examiner's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8696)|
| 2:24:58| from March 2020 through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8698)|
| 2:25:00| February 3rd of 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8700)|
| 2:25:02| A 72%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8702)|
| 2:25:04| increase in homicides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8704)|
| 2:25:06| 30% drug| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8706)|
| 2:25:08| related deaths. That's after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8708)|
| 2:25:10| we had our first decrease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8710)|
| 2:25:12| in 2018 to 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8712)|
| 2:25:14| But now we're on track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8714)|
| 2:25:16| to pass that in 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8716)|
| 2:25:18| And this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8718)|
| 2:25:20| is really horrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8720)|
| 2:25:22| Over a 500%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8722)|
| 2:25:24| increase in female| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8724)|
| 2:25:26| homicides. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8726)|
| 2:25:28| your wives, that's your daughters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8728)|
| 2:25:30| that's your grandchildren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8730)|
| 2:25:32| That's unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8732)|
| 2:25:34| And also an historic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8734)|
| 2:25:36| rise in juvenile homicides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8736)|
| 2:25:38| Again, something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8738)|
| 2:25:40| that's totally unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8740)|
| 2:25:42| We need to get this fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8742)|
| 2:25:44| We need to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8744)|
| 2:25:46| So out of respect for the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8746)|
| 2:25:48| and your time, I simply just request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8748)|
| 2:25:50| that you vote to dissolve the unelected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8750)|

| 2:26:18| to speak tonight. And it's a privilege| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8778)|
| 2:26:20| to use this first minute right to express| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8780)|
| 2:26:22| to our local government officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8782)|
| 2:26:24| that we the people have elected to govern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8784)|
| 2:26:26| all of Knox County. And we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8786)|
| 2:26:28| the people of Knox County did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8788)|
| 2:26:30| elect the Knox County Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8790)|
| 2:26:32| to govern us. Like many other counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8792)|
| 2:26:34| they should be advisory roles to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8794)|
| 2:26:36| community and not a governing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8796)|
| 2:26:38| body making decisions based on local findings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8798)|
| 2:26:40| but while utilizing national| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8800)|
| 2:26:42| recommendations that serves to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8802)|
| 2:26:44| best interest of all this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8804)|
| 2:26:46| And this issue I'm sure has been a challenging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8806)|
| 2:26:48| and difficult one for you to decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8808)|
| 2:26:50| whether or not to make it an advisory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8810)|
| 2:26:52| board or not. But I would like to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8812)|
| 2:26:54| issues that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8814)|
| 2:26:56| not only have been implemented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8816)|
| 2:26:58| in our own county but across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8818)|
| 2:27:00| The things that just really don't even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8820)|
| 2:27:02| make sense like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8822)|
| 2:27:04| closing restaurants at 10 o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8824)|
| 2:27:06| instead of 11 o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8826)|
| 2:27:08| after you've already made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8828)|
| 2:27:10| the capacity of restaurants to 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8830)|
| 2:27:14| And just closing those early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8834)|
| 2:27:16| that just doesn't even make any sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8836)|
| 2:27:18| Walking past a table if I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8838)|
| 2:27:20| sick I would stay at home. If I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8840)|
| 2:27:22| coughing I might want to wear a mask. But if I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8842)|
| 2:27:24| sick I do not need to wear a mask just to walk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8844)|
| 2:27:26| past the table to be able to take off a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8846)|
| 2:27:28| So those are some issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8848)|
| 2:27:30| that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8850)|

| 2:27:34| are implemented and they really don't do anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8854)|
| 2:27:36| for the common good to those extent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8856)|
| 2:27:38| Like I said, if the CDC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8858)|
| 2:27:40| says to stay at home, stay at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8860)|
| 2:27:42| If you're not symptomatic, even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8862)|
| 2:27:44| Dr. Fauci says, you cannot make a pandemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8864)|

| 2:27:48| So you have these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8868)|
| 2:27:50| illogical and irrational behaviors that you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8870)|
| 2:27:52| supposed to do all for the sake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8872)|
| 2:27:54| of the common good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8874)|
| 2:27:56| So that's saying, like I have, I've had COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8876)|
| 2:27:58| So let's just say I had COVID for 14 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8878)|
| 2:28:00| So 351 other days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8880)|
| 2:28:02| of the year I need to mask up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8882)|
| 2:28:04| because it's for everybody else's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8884)|
| 2:28:06| health and safety. But where's my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8886)|
| 2:28:08| freedom and safety? I'm not sick anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8888)|
| 2:28:10| So also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8890)|
| 2:28:12| I would like to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8892)|
| 2:28:14| the Board of Health. They could be touching on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8894)|
| 2:28:16| issues. Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8896)|
| 2:28:18| They should be talking about health issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8898)|
| 2:28:20| of COVID. There's a big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8900)|
| 2:28:22| scare tactic that's going on. People are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8902)|
| 2:28:24| driven to fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8904)|
| 2:28:26| And that's just not the reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8906)|
| 2:28:28| There is a reason to have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8908)|
| 2:28:30| healthy fear. But these health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8910)|
| 2:28:32| issues are so much more than physical. People| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8912)|
| 2:28:34| have already talked about those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8914)|
| 2:28:36| Children and adults who are isolated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8916)|
| 2:28:38| who have had suicides, depression, alcoholism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8918)|
| 2:28:40| is up. And the emotional and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8920)|
| 2:28:42| mental health of fear, that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8922)|
| 2:28:44| bigger than the virus itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8924)|
| 2:28:46| And so if they teamed up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8926)|
| 2:28:48| community and to educate on the real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8928)|
| 2:28:50| facts, the national numbers of death| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8930)|
| 2:28:52| the last three years were higher than they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8932)|
| 2:28:54| this past year with COVID. What about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8934)|
| 2:28:56| that fact? What about the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8936)|
| 2:28:58| that COVID, that could be prevented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8938)|
| 2:29:00| by a healthier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8940)|

| 2:29:12| So let's have people be educated about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8952)|
| 2:29:14| how they can be healthy and be responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8954)|
| 2:29:16| There are people walking around with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8956)|
| 2:29:18| masks, have had the vaccine and they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8958)|
| 2:29:20| still scared. There's fear that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8960)|
| 2:29:22| needs to end so we can have life, liberty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8962)|

| 2:29:52| All of the population data I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=8992)|

| 2:30:04| I compared Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9004)|

| 2:31:10| apparent that the data shows that living in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9070)|

| 2:31:32| not real is the belief that a mask mandate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9092)|
| 2:31:34| or a curfew shows any quantifiable data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9094)|

| 2:32:14| whose unconstitutional measures have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9134)|
| 2:32:16| shown no quantifiable benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9136)|
| 2:32:18| Thanks for working so hard to take a deep look at the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9138)|
| 2:32:20| We all appreciate the work you've done on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9140)|

| 2:32:38| have been coming to many, many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9158)|
| 2:32:40| of these meetings. I want you to know I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9160)|
| 2:32:42| as well do respect your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9162)|

| 2:32:46| your service. I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9166)|
| 2:32:48| get pretty passionate, so please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9168)|
| 2:32:50| don't confuse that with being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9170)|
| 2:32:52| rude. I just want to make sure that my point gets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9172)|
| 2:32:54| across. I will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9174)|
| 2:32:56| quote some familiar words from our Declaration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9176)|

| 2:33:00| truths to be self-evident, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9180)|

| 2:33:06| unalienable rights, that among these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9186)|
| 2:33:08| are life, liberty, and the pursuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9188)|
| 2:33:10| of happiness, that to secure these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9190)|
| 2:33:12| rights, governments are instituted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9192)|

| 2:33:16| powers from the consent of the governed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9196)|
| 2:33:18| the consent of the governed, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9198)|
| 2:33:20| whenever any form of government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9200)|
| 2:33:22| becomes destructive of these ends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9202)|
| 2:33:24| it is the right of the people to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9204)|
| 2:33:26| alter or to abolish it, and to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9206)|
| 2:33:28| institute new government, laying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9208)|
| 2:33:30| its foundation on such principles and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9210)|
| 2:33:32| organizing its powers in such form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9212)|
| 2:33:34| as to them shall seem most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9214)|
| 2:33:36| likely to affect their safety and happiness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9216)|
| 2:33:38| Prudence, indeed, will dictate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9218)|
| 2:33:40| that governments long established should not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9220)|
| 2:33:42| be changed for light and transient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9222)|

| 2:33:50| sufferable, than to right themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9230)|
| 2:33:52| by abolishing the forms to which they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9232)|
| 2:33:54| are accustomed. But when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9234)|
| 2:33:56| a long train of abuses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9236)|
| 2:33:58| and usurpations, pursuing invariably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9238)|
| 2:34:00| the same object evinces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9240)|
| 2:34:02| a design to reduce them under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9242)|
| 2:34:04| absolute despotism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9244)|
| 2:34:06| it is their right, it is their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9246)|
| 2:34:08| duty to throw off such| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9248)|
| 2:34:10| government, and to provide new guards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9250)|
| 2:34:12| for their future security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9252)|
| 2:34:14| The Knox County Board of Health was not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9254)|
| 2:34:16| installed by we the people. We the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9256)|
| 2:34:18| people had to say no, or had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9258)|
| 2:34:20| no say, had no voting right, to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9260)|
| 2:34:22| put the members of this board into a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9262)|
| 2:34:24| position they are in, especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9264)|
| 2:34:26| giving the board the right to apply mandates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9266)|
| 2:34:28| against our free will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9268)|
| 2:34:30| I am sure that a select few of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9270)|
| 2:34:32| members had good intentions of protecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9272)|
| 2:34:34| the health and well-being of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9274)|
| 2:34:36| residents during this so-called planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9276)|
| 2:34:38| pandemic. However, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9278)|
| 2:34:40| also believe if we were to dig as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9280)|
| 2:34:42| far as we could into the agenda at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9282)|
| 2:34:44| bottom of this board's actions, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9284)|
| 2:34:46| would find the same virus that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9286)|
| 2:34:48| plaguing every form of government around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9288)|
| 2:34:50| our nation, starting in every single| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9290)|

| 2:34:54| up to the very top. There is nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9294)|
| 2:34:56| in the world that by law can take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9296)|
| 2:34:58| away my constitutional rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9298)|
| 2:35:00| even a pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9300)|
| 2:35:02| Free agency and free will is given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9302)|

| 2:35:06| I thank our God in heaven that those rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9306)|
| 2:35:08| are protected in the Constitution of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9308)|
| 2:35:10| United States. I happened to run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9310)|
| 2:35:12| into Terri Hill at one of my very favorite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9312)|
| 2:35:14| local places of business several weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9314)|
| 2:35:16| She and I discussed the current situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9316)|
| 2:35:18| of the Board of Health and their actions in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9318)|
| 2:35:20| relation to the pandemic. I expressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9320)|
| 2:35:22| my concern for the board's overreach of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9322)|
| 2:35:24| power. Terri's response gave me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9324)|
| 2:35:26| great pause. She addressed that she understood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9326)|
| 2:35:28| my concern, as it is also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9328)|
| 2:35:30| obviously the concern of many of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9330)|
| 2:35:32| industriates. However, her reply was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9332)|
| 2:35:34| I just don't feel that right now is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9334)|
| 2:35:36| the time to do anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9336)|
| 2:35:38| Our conversation was very congenial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9338)|
| 2:35:40| She and I are both very respectful people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9340)|
| 2:35:42| However, as Terri walked away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9342)|
| 2:35:44| I turned to my husband and I said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9344)|
| 2:35:46| Now is exactly the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9346)|
| 2:35:48| to address the board's power because their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9348)|
| 2:35:50| actions were the result of the current problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9350)|
| 2:35:52| I believe the true agenda of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9352)|
| 2:35:54| Board of Health, as well as many other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9354)|
| 2:35:56| counties and cities around this nation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9356)|
| 2:35:58| has been completely exposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9358)|
| 2:36:00| There is definitely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9360)|
| 2:36:02| one good thing that has resulted from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9362)|
| 2:36:04| the economic shutdown of the world based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9364)|
| 2:36:06| the pandemic. It woke me up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9366)|
| 2:36:08| It woke up millions of people to what is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9368)|
| 2:36:10| actually happening to our country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9370)|
| 2:36:12| and to our planet. This is bigger than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9372)|
| 2:36:14| a virus, bigger than mask mandates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9374)|
| 2:36:16| and physical distancing, but the solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9376)|
| 2:36:18| has to start at the local level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9378)|
| 2:36:20| Ms. Hudson, if you could wrap up your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9380)|
| 2:36:22| Yes, I have so many other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9382)|
| 2:36:24| to say. We have more people to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9384)|
| 2:36:26| I understand. I understand. I will finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9386)|
| 2:36:28| I do want to say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9388)|
| 2:36:30| I'm so concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9390)|
| 2:36:32| about the children of our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9392)|
| 2:36:34| I have children ranging in age from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9394)|
| 2:36:36| 19, a freshman in college, down to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9396)|
| 2:36:38| 4-year-old who will start kindergarten next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9398)|
| 2:36:40| And I will not send my 4-year-old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9400)|
| 2:36:42| to a Knox County school if masks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9402)|
| 2:36:44| are required next year. Children need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9404)|
| 2:36:46| to see each other's faces. They need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9406)|

| 2:37:34| Thank you for the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9454)|
| 2:37:36| to speak to you once again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9456)|
| 2:37:38| I would like to bring to your attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9458)|
| 2:37:40| an issue that seems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9460)|
| 2:37:42| like nobody's talking about, but everybody should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9462)|
| 2:37:44| be at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9464)|
| 2:37:46| In July 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9466)|
| 2:37:48| Dr. O'Brien brought to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9468)|
| 2:37:50| the Board of Health his proposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9470)|
| 2:37:52| for mandates, curfew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9472)|
| 2:37:54| and mask mandates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9474)|
| 2:37:56| At that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9476)|
| 2:37:58| at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9478)|
| 2:38:00| Deputy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9480)|
| 2:38:02| Law Director Morton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9482)|
| 2:38:04| asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9484)|
| 2:38:06| Dr. O'Brien| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9486)|
| 2:38:08| for reasons for this. There had to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9488)|
| 2:38:10| credible reasons, because he said that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9490)|
| 2:38:12| when you do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9492)|
| 2:38:14| the state law automatically makes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9494)|
| 2:38:16| mandates misdemeanors, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9496)|
| 2:38:18| you have to have a credible reason for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9498)|
| 2:38:20| making mandates. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9500)|
| 2:38:22| Dr. O'Brien said this. He said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9502)|
| 2:38:24| it's because we've got to protect our elderly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9504)|
| 2:38:26| This is why he stayed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9506)|
| 2:38:28| We've got to protect our elderly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9508)|
| 2:38:30| Death rate is at 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9510)|
| 2:38:32| And that's unacceptable to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9512)|
| 2:38:34| So we've got to put these mandates in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9514)|
| 2:38:36| to protect our elderly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9516)|
| 2:38:38| the most vulnerable in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9518)|
| 2:38:40| Now, in the last nine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9520)|
| 2:38:42| months, Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9522)|
| 2:38:44| has obsessed over these mandates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9524)|
| 2:38:46| barely even talked about the other five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9526)|
| 2:38:48| core actions in their meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9528)|
| 2:38:50| They don't even pursue any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9530)|
| 2:38:52| other actions to mitigate the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9532)|
| 2:38:54| especially to our elderly. In the last nine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9534)|
| 2:38:56| months, folks, let me tell you what's happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9536)|
| 2:38:58| Look at your own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9538)|
| 2:39:00| health department's website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9540)|
| 2:39:02| The death rate for the elderly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9542)|
| 2:39:04| has risen to 14.15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9544)|
| 2:39:06| That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9546)|
| 2:39:08| almost five times of what Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9548)|
| 2:39:10| O'Brien said was unacceptable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9550)|
| 2:39:12| and the reason for doing these mandates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9552)|
| 2:39:14| This is outrageous. I can't believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9554)|
| 2:39:16| nobody's talking about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9556)|
| 2:39:20| For that reason alone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9560)|
| 2:39:22| you need to make this right tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9562)|
| 2:39:24| The very reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9564)|
| 2:39:26| they were doing this has failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9566)|
| 2:39:28| The very people they said they were protecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9568)|
| 2:39:32| With all due respect, this is incompetence at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9572)|
| 2:39:34| You need to make this right tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9574)|
| 2:39:36| Make it right. Would you please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9576)|
| 2:39:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9578)|

| 2:39:42| That concludes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9582)|

| 2:41:14| zoning up to three dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9674)|
| 2:41:16| by a vote of 8-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9676)|
| 2:41:22| Would you like to present any information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9682)|
| 2:41:24| on this project, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9684)|
| 2:41:26| Just briefly, we agree with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9686)|
| 2:41:28| Planning Commission's vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9688)|
| 2:41:30| We originally asked for four dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9690)|
| 2:41:32| with a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9692)|
| 2:41:34| We settled on three because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9694)|
| 2:41:36| with the traffic impact analysis that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9696)|
| 2:41:38| accepted by the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9698)|
| 2:41:40| it didn't require a sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9700)|
| 2:41:42| and we can go up to three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9702)|
| 2:41:44| This is a relatively small piece of property out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9704)|
| 2:41:46| seven acres, and that will give us about 21 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=9706)|

| 2:47:02| different, I don't think they had many concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10022)|
| 2:47:04| They knew we were going to get in there and develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10024)|
| 2:47:06| it. We have a good concept plan, which I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10026)|
| 2:47:08| I don't know if I copied the entire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10028)|

| 2:47:20| It's one of our larger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10040)|

| 2:47:26| a higher price point than we normally offer in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10046)|

| 2:47:50| build it up or put some sort of retaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10070)|
| 2:47:52| wall or something, because it does go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10072)|
| 2:47:54| downhill quite fast. It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10074)|
| 2:47:56| The engineering calculations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10076)|
| 2:47:58| and I know we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10078)|
| 2:48:00| talking only about 19 acres right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10080)|
| 2:48:02| but now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10082)|
| 2:48:04| that we've acquired the land next door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10084)|
| 2:48:06| I'm going to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10086)|

| 2:48:14| we will bring it up. I don't know exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10094)|
| 2:48:16| how many feet that will be, but it is 10,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10096)|
| 2:48:18| yards of dirt. We will bring it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10098)|

| 2:48:28| Thank you. Mr. Snowden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10108)|
| 2:48:32| Josh, stay right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10112)|
| 2:48:36| Rob or someone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10116)|
| 2:48:38| is it possible to get the top| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10118)|

| 2:48:42| Is Rob still here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10122)|
| 2:48:44| or anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10124)|
| 2:48:50| Jim, you sent this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10130)|
| 2:48:52| letter to Drew,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10132)|
| 2:48:54| and she forwarded it on? Yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10134)|
| 2:48:56| Commissioner. What is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10136)|
| 2:48:58| drop-dead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10138)|
| 2:49:00| elevation? Is it 961| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10140)|
| 2:49:02| or 963?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10142)|
| 2:49:04| The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10144)|
| 2:49:06| what we would set as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10146)|
| 2:49:08| minimum finish floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10148)|
| 2:49:10| is that what you're asking, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10150)|
| 2:49:12| Yeah, down here at the bottom, it says the drainage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10152)|
| 2:49:14| the current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10154)|
| 2:49:16| 100-year flood stage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10156)|
| 2:49:18| needs to be a minimum of one foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10158)|
| 2:49:20| above the current 500-year flood stage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10160)|
| 2:49:22| or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10162)|
| 2:49:24| probably will be 963| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10164)|
| 2:49:26| feet. Yes, that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10166)|
| 2:49:28| let me read it again, make sure I tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10168)|
| 2:49:30| correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10170)|
| 2:49:32| This way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10172)|
| 2:49:40| Yeah, the current...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10180)|
| 2:49:42| Mr. Daley, is one of these maps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10182)|
| 2:49:44| one you're asking about specifically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10184)|
| 2:49:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10188)|
| 2:49:50| That one might work there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10190)|
| 2:49:52| We could go KGIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10192)|
| 2:49:54| See if you can expand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10194)|
| 2:49:56| that one up while...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10196)|
| 2:49:59| My question is, can you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10199)|
| 2:50:01| go to the site map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10201)|
| 2:50:03| link on that and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10203)|
| 2:50:05| get to the till poles and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10205)|
| 2:50:07| KGIS from there? I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10207)|
| 2:50:09| it's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10209)|
| 2:50:11| Well, that map shows, Jim, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10211)|
| 2:50:13| for everyone at 963| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10213)|
| 2:50:15| starts over to the left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10215)|
| 2:50:17| or 960, I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10217)|
| 2:50:19| starts to the left in the white,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10219)|
| 2:50:21| goes up onto the property in question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10221)|
| 2:50:23| goes up almost to the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10223)|
| 2:50:25| at the house, goes over to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10225)|
| 2:50:27| next property that Josh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10227)|
| 2:50:29| or Smithfield is buying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10229)|
| 2:50:31| So my question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10231)|
| 2:50:33| is the housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10233)|
| 2:50:35| going to be above that line or below that line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10235)|
| 2:50:37| It's going to be, elevation-wise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10237)|
| 2:50:39| it'll be above. We'll require that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10239)|
| 2:50:41| every finished floor of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10241)|
| 2:50:43| homes that Mr. Sandison proposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10243)|
| 2:50:45| to be above finished floor elevation of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10245)|
| 2:50:47| 963.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10247)|
| 2:50:49| That's one foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10249)|
| 2:50:51| above the 500-year flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10251)|
| 2:50:53| As Josh mentioned, FEMA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10253)|
| 2:50:55| has regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10255)|
| 2:50:57| Those regulations actually call for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10257)|
| 2:50:59| just one foot above the 100-year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10259)|
| 2:51:01| Our regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10261)|
| 2:51:03| are more stringent than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10263)|
| 2:51:05| FEMA's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10265)|
| 2:51:07| We require one foot above the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10267)|
| 2:51:09| 500-year, as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10269)|
| 2:51:11| FEMA allows you to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10271)|
| 2:51:13| fill within the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10273)|
| 2:51:15| floodplain all the way down to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10275)|
| 2:51:17| floodway. We require that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10277)|
| 2:51:19| no-fill zone to be halfway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10279)|
| 2:51:21| between the two. So our regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10281)|
| 2:51:23| are quite a bit more stringent than if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10283)|
| 2:51:25| you're building in some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10285)|
| 2:51:27| other surrounding counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10287)|
| 2:51:29| Hey, Josh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10289)|
| 2:51:31| Did you follow what I said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10291)|
| 2:51:33| Yes, sir. So you're going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10293)|
| 2:51:35| building above the 960 line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10295)|
| 2:51:37| Yes, sir. So your homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10297)|
| 2:51:39| will be kind of up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10299)|
| 2:51:41| near the road and back over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10301)|
| 2:51:43| Yeah, not only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10303)|
| 2:51:45| the homes but the lots as well. So we won't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10305)|
| 2:51:47| just put the lot right on the 960. We'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10307)|
| 2:51:49| actually move it forward and have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10309)|

| 2:51:53| an embankment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10313)|
| 2:51:55| It looks like you're going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10315)|
| 2:51:57| 70% of your property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10317)|
| 2:51:59| going to be floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10319)|
| 2:52:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10321)|
| 2:52:03| On our concept, we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10323)|
| 2:52:05| seven or eight lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10325)|
| 2:52:07| that will be property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10327)|
| 2:52:09| lines all the way down to the creek. So on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10329)|
| 2:52:11| average, they're two and a half to three acre tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10331)|
| 2:52:13| So they'll be able to have a house out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10333)|
| 2:52:15| the floodplain, meaning they don't have to carry flood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10335)|
| 2:52:17| insurance. And then their property and their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10337)|
| 2:52:19| property will go all the way down to the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10339)|
| 2:52:21| So our concept shows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10341)|
| 2:52:23| seven or eight of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10343)|
| 2:52:25| I'm trying to find. There was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10345)|
| 2:52:27| concept plan I've seen somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10347)|
| 2:52:29| I meant to send it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10349)|
| 2:52:31| I know Chairman was on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10351)|
| 2:52:33| I think a few others was on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10353)|
| 2:52:35| It's not on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10355)|
| 2:52:37| I forgot where I've seen it, but I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10357)|
| 2:52:39| it showed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10359)|
| 2:52:41| they're going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10361)|
| 2:52:43| condominiums there or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10363)|
| 2:52:45| where's that at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10365)|
| 2:52:47| It kind of looks like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10367)|
| 2:52:49| You're through three fish bowls, so I can...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10369)|
| 2:52:51| No, this is something completely different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10371)|
| 2:52:53| The concept showed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10373)|
| 2:52:55| I divided it into the two parts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10375)|
| 2:52:57| red and orange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10377)|
| 2:52:59| That's it. If you want to pass that around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10379)|
| 2:53:01| after you're done, Mr. Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10381)|
| 2:53:03| Yeah, that was in an email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10383)|
| 2:53:11| You answered my question? Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10391)|
| 2:53:13| Commissioner Bealey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10393)|
| 2:53:15| Just wanted to know which other parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10395)|
| 2:53:17| it was you had acquired. Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10397)|
| 2:53:19| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10399)|
| 2:53:21| I'm going to go through a round of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10401)|
| 2:53:23| then we're going to bring you up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10403)|
| 2:53:25| Sure, I'm good. Thank you. Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10405)|
| 2:53:33| So, Josh, you won't be building in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10413)|
| 2:53:35| 100-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10415)|
| 2:53:37| floodplain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10417)|
| 2:53:39| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10419)|
| 2:53:41| Or the 500-year? No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10421)|
| 2:53:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10423)|
| 2:53:45| I appreciate you going to the extra effort of coming up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10425)|
| 2:53:47| with a concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10427)|
| 2:53:49| the extra expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10429)|
| 2:53:51| I did have, and I know this is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10431)|
| 2:53:53| where we talk about these things, but I did have a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10433)|
| 2:53:55| about it. And my concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10435)|
| 2:53:57| was that those slots are going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10437)|
| 2:53:59| really, really deep in the back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10439)|
| 2:54:01| and I worry about maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10441)|
| 2:54:03| Yes, sir. If people will let those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10443)|
| 2:54:05| grow up and if that will affect the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10445)|
| 2:54:07| floodplain, we're at nice moat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10447)|
| 2:54:09| fields right now. We would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10449)|
| 2:54:11| like to work with Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10451)|
| 2:54:13| Law Department and Engineering to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10453)|
| 2:54:15| make some stringent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10455)|
| 2:54:17| HOA rules to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10457)|
| 2:54:19| the homeowner who's buying that property, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10459)|
| 2:54:21| we're going to price them at a point where it's going to be over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10461)|
| 2:54:23| $100,000 a lot, so hopefully that buyer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10463)|
| 2:54:25| will not only not follow the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10465)|
| 2:54:27| rules, but take advantage of having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10467)|
| 2:54:29| that beautiful piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10469)|
| 2:54:31| I just wondered if you considered using that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10471)|
| 2:54:33| as a common area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10473)|
| 2:54:35| where the homeowners association would take care of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10475)|
| 2:54:37| and it would just be a field for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10477)|
| 2:54:39| cats to fly cats and have picnics in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10479)|
| 2:54:41| Absolutely. We were talking about doing maybe a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10481)|
| 2:54:43| 50-foot easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10483)|
| 2:54:45| right away or common area or strip| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10485)|
| 2:54:47| that all the community, whether you live on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10487)|
| 2:54:49| front road or on the back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10489)|
| 2:54:51| wherever you live on the subdivision, you can access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10491)|
| 2:54:53| the creek. Okay, because a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10493)|
| 2:54:55| of people with lots that are this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10495)|
| 2:54:57| size frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10497)|

| 2:55:01| equipment to mow two acres behind them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10501)|
| 2:55:03| No, they don't. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10503)|
| 2:55:05| keep it down like it is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10505)|
| 2:55:07| We have a lot of problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10507)|
| 2:55:09| when we have flooding events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10509)|
| 2:55:11| with debris,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10511)|
| 2:55:13| brush, getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10513)|
| 2:55:15| pushed downstream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10515)|
| 2:55:17| into culverts and bridges and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10517)|
| 2:55:19| creating additional flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10519)|
| 2:55:21| I just wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10521)|
| 2:55:23| to throw that out there. No, that's a legit concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10523)|
| 2:55:25| and a good point and we'd be more than happy to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10525)|
| 2:55:27| implement it on our concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10527)|
| 2:55:29| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10529)|
| 2:55:33| Thank you, Chairman Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10533)|
| 2:55:35| Mr. Sanderson? Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10535)|
| 2:55:37| In the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10537)|
| 2:55:39| paperwork that you supplied to Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10539)|
| 2:55:41| you're showing both tracts of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10541)|
| 2:55:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10543)|
| 2:55:47| Had the thought occurred to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10547)|
| 2:55:49| since you're going to be going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10549)|
| 2:55:51| the Knoxville Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10551)|
| 2:55:53| for the second parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10553)|
| 2:55:55| in the month of April| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10555)|
| 2:55:57| to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10557)|
| 2:55:59| come back to us when you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10559)|
| 2:56:01| that parcel and we talk about both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10561)|
| 2:56:03| parcels at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10563)|
| 2:56:05| I guess that would be 60 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10565)|
| 2:56:07| from tonight. Because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10567)|
| 2:56:09| your concept plan showing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10569)|
| 2:56:11| driveway of where it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10571)|
| 2:56:13| the road surface where it goes into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10573)|
| 2:56:15| the parcel number two, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10575)|
| 2:56:17| 11.08 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10577)|
| 2:56:19| Since we're kind of talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10579)|
| 2:56:21| one development, even though it's two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10581)|
| 2:56:23| parcels, does it not make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10583)|
| 2:56:25| sense to be doing this all at the same time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10585)|
| 2:56:29| Very fair question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10589)|
| 2:56:31| I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10591)|
| 2:56:35| practically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10595)|
| 2:56:37| we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10597)|
| 2:56:39| At the same time, it's almost like we're getting punished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10599)|
| 2:56:41| for acquiring that and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10601)|
| 2:56:43| showing you that we're going to go ahead and tie in because we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10603)|
| 2:56:45| actually did submit for our concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10605)|
| 2:56:47| just on this 19 acres, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10607)|
| 2:56:49| we got ahold of each neighbor on each side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10609)|
| 2:56:51| One said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10611)|
| 2:56:53| go wherever. And then the other one said, yeah, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10613)|
| 2:56:55| interested in selling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10615)|
| 2:56:57| So I'd like to go ahead and get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10617)|
| 2:56:59| this one so we can move forward with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10619)|
| 2:57:01| We can start the processing with TDEC and everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10621)|
| 2:57:03| else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10623)|
| 2:57:05| On the document that you supplied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10625)|
| 2:57:07| to us, you're showing two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10627)|
| 2:57:09| lots that would be cut in half if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10629)|
| 2:57:11| we approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10631)|
| 2:57:13| just the parcel number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10633)|
| 2:57:15| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10635)|
| 2:57:17| Obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10637)|
| 2:57:19| like my email said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10639)|
| 2:57:21| fast track the engineering on this part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10641)|
| 2:57:23| just because we've had so many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10643)|
| 2:57:25| neighbors and constituents concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10645)|
| 2:57:27| about the flooding. So we went ahead and expedited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10647)|
| 2:57:29| the engineering to move this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10649)|
| 2:57:31| And as we laid it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10651)|
| 2:57:33| back out and we have this final concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10653)|
| 2:57:35| and not holding any cards back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10655)|
| 2:57:37| wanted to go ahead and submit to the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10657)|
| 2:57:39| and say, look, this is our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10659)|
| 2:57:41| This is what we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10661)|
| 2:57:43| And we'd like to, I know it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10663)|
| 2:57:45| I don't want to say piecing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10665)|
| 2:57:47| together, but we were already on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10667)|
| 2:57:49| the road to this one, and I'd like to go ahead and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10669)|
| 2:57:51| stick on this road to get this one approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10671)|
| 2:57:53| and follow the track that we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10673)|
| 2:57:55| going on this piece as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10675)|
| 2:57:57| Okay, last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10677)|
| 2:57:59| It's true, but the other side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10679)|
| 2:58:01| is, you know, right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10681)|
| 2:58:03| you don't know if the NOx| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10683)|
| 2:58:05| planning is going to approve parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10685)|
| 2:58:07| two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10687)|
| 2:58:09| Well, in my experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10689)|
| 2:58:11| I don't see when the next door neighbor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10691)|
| 2:58:13| also has three units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10693)|
| 2:58:15| why they would go back and have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10695)|
| 2:58:17| a different opinion, even though it has less flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10697)|
| 2:58:19| We're not even accessing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10699)|
| 2:58:21| it with the entrance. We'll come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10701)|
| 2:58:23| in off our subdivision, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10703)|
| 2:58:25| I don't want to say we're making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10705)|
| 2:58:27| it easier because instead of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10707)|
| 2:58:29| if someone else went in here and bought that, they'd have to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10709)|
| 2:58:31| all the planning and flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10711)|
| 2:58:33| and everything that we'd have to engineer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10713)|
| 2:58:35| but also have a separate entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10715)|
| 2:58:37| would have to have their own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10717)|
| 2:58:39| it'd be a whole separate neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10719)|
| 2:58:41| So us acquiring it and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10721)|
| 2:58:43| mixing in with us and showing it on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10723)|
| 2:58:45| front end, I feel like I'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10725)|
| 2:58:47| like to move forward with what we have in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10727)|
| 2:58:49| Okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10729)|
| 2:58:51| last question before we hear from the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10731)|
| 2:58:53| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10733)|
| 2:58:55| Not so much of a question as a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10735)|
| 2:58:57| As a builder myself, I could get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10737)|
| 2:58:59| a two-month head start to start prepping that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10739)|
| 2:59:01| land and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10741)|
| 2:59:03| once I get the earthing signed off on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10743)|
| 2:59:05| next property, it'd be more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10745)|
| 2:59:07| the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10747)|
| 2:59:09| time is money in this industry and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10749)|
| 2:59:11| we're coming out of wet season right now, going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10751)|
| 2:59:13| into the dry season, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10753)|
| 2:59:15| the quicker you can get the land prepping, get things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10755)|
| 2:59:17| going, the better. So I understand why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10757)|
| 2:59:19| this is coming first and then the second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10759)|
| 2:59:21| property's coming later. It makes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10761)|
| 2:59:23| sense to me at least. This way you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10763)|
| 2:59:25| start the ball rolling and get moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10765)|
| 2:59:27| and like you said, if you're getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10767)|
| 2:59:29| three acres, I don't see why your property next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10769)|
| 2:59:31| to you won't get three acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10771)|
| 2:59:33| We are voting just on the zoning on the concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10773)|
| 2:59:35| and it's very nice of you to show us the concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10775)|
| 2:59:37| but I want to make sure we focus on the zoning and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10777)|
| 2:59:39| what's fair zoning-wise. So thank you for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10779)|
| 2:59:41| your extra information you gave tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10781)|
| 2:59:43| Okay, Ms. Julie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10783)|
| 2:59:45| If you would, Josh, I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10785)|
| 2:59:47| You can either stay there or join us at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10787)|
| 2:59:49| I'll stand here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10789)|
| 2:59:51| And I'll give you ample time as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10791)|
| 2:59:53| Good evening. If you could just state your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10793)|
| 2:59:55| name. Oh, you already did. You did that. Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10795)|
| 2:59:57| Welcome. Good evening. I appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10797)|
| 2:59:59| your time this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10799)|
| 3:00:01| Like I said, my name is Julie McBee. I do live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10801)|
| 3:00:03| in the Carnes community and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10803)|
| 3:00:05| kind of represent a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10805)|
| 3:00:07| citizens in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10807)|
| 3:00:09| I'm here to speak in direct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10809)|
| 3:00:11| opposition to the property that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10811)|
| 3:00:13| we've spoken about by Smithfield and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10813)|
| 3:00:15| this land at the 8520| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10815)|
| 3:00:17| Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10817)|
| 3:00:19| address. Let me begin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10819)|
| 3:00:21| by stating I passed down a copy of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10821)|
| 3:00:23| papers. Unfortunately, it looks more like a packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10823)|
| 3:00:25| But on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10825)|
| 3:00:27| first sheet that I sent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10827)|
| 3:00:29| out, that was an email that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10829)|
| 3:00:31| hopefully sent to each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10831)|
| 3:00:33| of you. It is from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10833)|
| 3:00:35| a longtime family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10835)|
| 3:00:37| friend of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10837)|
| 3:00:39| originally from 1950s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10839)|
| 3:00:41| I think 1956. And he talks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10841)|
| 3:00:43| about even then the amount of flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10843)|
| 3:00:45| that has been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10845)|
| 3:00:47| He even, and I read over it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10847)|
| 3:00:49| and he even referenced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10849)|
| 3:00:51| that his concern was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10851)|
| 3:00:53| the problem was not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10853)|
| 3:00:55| above the ground, it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10855)|
| 3:00:57| below the surface of the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10857)|
| 3:00:59| He knows if at least one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10859)|
| 3:01:01| funnel or tunnel, and that was his verbiage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10861)|
| 3:01:03| that came up in the middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10863)|
| 3:01:05| of the field, there was a large hole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10865)|
| 3:01:07| that opened up in the pasture as to what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10867)|
| 3:01:09| they called the bull lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10869)|
| 3:01:11| In describing that, he also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10871)|
| 3:01:13| stated that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10873)|
| 3:01:15| when the waters came up through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10875)|

| 3:01:29| that hole. And he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10889)|
| 3:01:31| said it was kind of unique to be on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10891)|
| 3:01:33| a farm and all of this water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10893)|
| 3:01:35| that then receded in a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10895)|
| 3:01:37| of days or a week, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10897)|

| 3:01:45| had always stated that this was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10905)|
| 3:01:47| not a great piece of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10907)|
| 3:01:49| property to develop. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10909)|
| 3:01:51| if you look at some pictures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10911)|
| 3:01:53| you will notice one house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10913)|
| 3:01:55| and one barn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10915)|

| 3:02:01| because that's the only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10921)|
| 3:02:03| high point on that whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10923)|
| 3:02:05| piece of property. They already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10925)|

| 3:03:11| at the very bottom. I'm sorry, those really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=10991)|

| 3:05:09| He had to go in, gut everything out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11109)|
| 3:05:11| rebuild, and then in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11111)|
| 3:05:13| 2020, guess what happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11113)|
| 3:05:15| Had another flooding event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11115)|
| 3:05:17| That flooding was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11117)|
| 3:05:19| not as significant, but that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11119)|
| 3:05:21| flooding also went up underneath the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11121)|
| 3:05:23| He had to tear out all the ductwork,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11123)|
| 3:05:25| put yet another HVA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11125)|

| 3:05:31| since the 1950s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11131)|
| 3:05:35| Those are some pictures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11135)|

| 3:05:39| Then the pictures that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11139)|
| 3:05:41| I actually sent, like I said, those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11141)|
| 3:05:43| were pictures specifically from this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11143)|

| 3:05:47| nor go to Staples and make copies of all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11147)|
| 3:05:49| that. But anyway, that's one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11149)|
| 3:05:51| of our concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11151)|

| 3:06:47| to mention that FEMA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11207)|

| 3:07:07| that we have with flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11227)|

| 3:07:17| going to do it because I think the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11237)|
| 3:07:19| comment was, it's one mile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11239)|

| 3:07:23| for FEMA to come out and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11243)|
| 3:07:25| reassess and look at those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11245)|

| 3:07:29| that number is correct. I know it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11249)|
| 3:07:31| quite a bit of money. Beaver Creek is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11251)|

| 3:07:43| that not every piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11263)|

| 3:07:59| You really can't change that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11279)|
| 3:08:01| a whole lot. You can add some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11281)|
| 3:08:03| field dirt, but what does that do for the foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11283)|
| 3:08:05| of a home? Not a whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11285)|
| 3:08:07| I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11287)|
| 3:08:09| want to ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11289)|
| 3:08:11| we're talking about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11291)|
| 3:08:13| what is the financial responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11293)|
| 3:08:15| that people are going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11295)|
| 3:08:17| have to undertake, and as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11297)|
| 3:08:19| a government, and as a state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11299)|
| 3:08:21| for putting homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11301)|
| 3:08:23| in this flood area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11303)|
| 3:08:25| Granted, there may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11305)|
| 3:08:27| be a couple of homes on the frontage that are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11307)|
| 3:08:29| going to have major problems, but those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11309)|
| 3:08:31| homes on the back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11311)|
| 3:08:33| it was called late| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11313)|

| 3:08:37| owners, and I wonder why they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11317)|
| 3:08:39| termed that phrase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11319)|
| 3:08:41| that phrase. When it rains,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11321)|
| 3:08:43| get your kayak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11323)|
| 3:08:45| get a boat, you can go right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11325)|
| 3:08:47| on down to Mountain Hill if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11327)|
| 3:08:49| you wanted to from all of that flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11329)|

| 3:08:55| those homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11335)|
| 3:08:57| that are sitting back there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11337)|
| 3:08:59| they're going to have water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11339)|
| 3:09:01| They're going to have possibly mold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11341)|
| 3:09:03| mildew, and we all know what water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11343)|
| 3:09:05| does to a house and the sheetrock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11345)|
| 3:09:07| and the foundation and things like that, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11347)|
| 3:09:09| I did want to mention that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11349)|
| 3:09:13| A few more things, if I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11353)|

| 3:09:41| When we take these supposed homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11381)|
| 3:09:43| and we add that to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11383)|
| 3:09:45| an area that is already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11385)|

| 3:11:02| about the intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11462)|

| 3:11:55| Mr. Schoomaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11515)|
| 3:11:57| he had to sit there for just a few minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11517)|
| 3:11:59| so he could even get onto| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11519)|
| 3:12:01| Beaver Ridge Road and get to Oak Ridge Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11521)|

| 3:13:21| that all as one piece because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11601)|
| 3:13:23| they're going to affect each other, how the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11603)|
| 3:13:25| land layout is and the number of homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11605)|

| 3:13:29| like to ask, stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11609)|
| 3:13:31| this development or delay the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11611)|
| 3:13:33| until some of the road conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11613)|
| 3:13:35| are improved. That was my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11615)|
| 3:13:37| thing. We need a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11617)|
| 3:13:39| traffic study, an accurate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11619)|

| 3:14:07| improve our intersection. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11647)|
| 3:14:09| even a possibility that we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11649)|
| 3:14:11| maybe ask for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11651)|
| 3:14:13| We would ask that there not be any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11653)|

| 3:15:11| start off by just asking Mr. Snowden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11711)|
| 3:15:13| two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11713)|

| 3:15:27| question eventually leads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11727)|
| 3:15:29| to what if this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11729)|
| 3:15:31| went through and FEMA came back in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11731)|
| 3:15:33| in two years or five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11733)|
| 3:15:35| years and did the next six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11735)|
| 3:15:37| miles and went, oh, by the way, this line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11737)|
| 3:15:39| actually needs to be up here and that happens to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11739)|
| 3:15:41| right in the middle of somebody's house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11741)|
| 3:15:43| What would that do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11743)|
| 3:15:45| Yeah. We looked at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11745)|
| 3:15:47| We had a, you're right, FEMA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11747)|
| 3:15:49| obviously we don't control. Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11749)|
| 3:15:51| County really has no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11751)|
| 3:15:53| control over what FEMA, how they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11753)|
| 3:15:55| map and what their schedule is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11755)|
| 3:15:57| One of the things that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11757)|
| 3:15:59| looked at, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11759)|
| 3:16:01| Ogden, a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11761)|
| 3:16:03| geotechnical and flood consultant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11763)|
| 3:16:05| that we work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11765)|
| 3:16:07| in the past, done a study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11767)|
| 3:16:09| and I think the current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11769)|
| 3:16:11| flood maps are 97, don't hold me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11771)|
| 3:16:13| to that, I think that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11773)|
| 3:16:15| They looked at a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11775)|
| 3:16:17| situation where if the entirety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11777)|
| 3:16:19| of the watershed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11779)|
| 3:16:21| was developed in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11781)|
| 3:16:23| consistency with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11783)|
| 3:16:25| what Josh is doing or residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11785)|
| 3:16:27| development at that reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11787)|
| 3:16:29| density, that essentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11789)|
| 3:16:31| the 100-year elevation would change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11791)|
| 3:16:33| by 1.5 feet, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11793)|
| 3:16:35| is what I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11795)|
| 3:16:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11797)|
| 3:16:39| 1.55 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11799)|
| 3:16:41| So that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11801)|
| 3:16:43| be the absolute worst case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11803)|
| 3:16:45| scenario| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11805)|
| 3:16:47| assuming that the entirety of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11807)|
| 3:16:49| watershed was developed. Obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11809)|
| 3:16:51| that's not going to occur, but that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11811)|
| 3:16:53| we've kind of set that as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11813)|
| 3:16:55| upper end of the threshold, if that can give you an idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11815)|
| 3:16:57| And that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11817)|
| 3:16:59| and our standard of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11819)|
| 3:17:01| one foot above the 500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11821)|
| 3:17:03| for this would be, let's say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11823)|
| 3:17:05| that got recategorized and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11825)|
| 3:17:07| did occur, these finished floors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11827)|
| 3:17:09| would still be above that elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11829)|
| 3:17:11| So our higher standard in FEMA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11831)|
| 3:17:13| is going to create situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11833)|
| 3:17:15| to where we don't feel like these homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11835)|
| 3:17:17| would flood should that watershed be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11837)|
| 3:17:19| developed as proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11839)|
| 3:17:21| Second question is, can you update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11841)|
| 3:17:23| us on any traffic related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11843)|
| 3:17:25| improvements, TDOT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11845)|
| 3:17:27| is this all state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11847)|
| 3:17:29| Help us understand, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11849)|
| 3:17:31| it is a concern, I know it's growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11851)|
| 3:17:33| It is, it is. And it's an odd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11853)|
| 3:17:35| intersection because you've got two legs that stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11855)|
| 3:17:37| and that eastbound leg does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11857)|
| 3:17:39| stop. One of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11859)|
| 3:17:41| primary reasons of that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11861)|
| 3:17:43| line of sight, looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11863)|
| 3:17:45| back to the west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11865)|
| 3:17:47| you know, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11867)|
| 3:17:49| part of the reason why we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11869)|
| 3:17:51| can't really pull that stop sign up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11871)|
| 3:17:53| and make it more of a traditional T intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11873)|
| 3:17:55| The state route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11875)|
| 3:17:57| state route 131, actually turns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11877)|
| 3:17:59| there. So if you're traveling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11879)|
| 3:18:01| north on Beaver Ridge Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11881)|
| 3:18:03| and make a right to go east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11883)|
| 3:18:05| onto Emory, that 131| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11885)|
| 3:18:07| state route, just dog legs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11887)|
| 3:18:09| there. And then the Carnes Valley Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11889)|
| 3:18:11| or that section of West Emory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11891)|
| 3:18:13| is our road. We do have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11893)|
| 3:18:15| that project identified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11895)|
| 3:18:17| as a need in the mobility plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11897)|
| 3:18:19| So it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11899)|
| 3:18:21| something that we're aware of. We've asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11901)|
| 3:18:23| the state to partner with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11903)|
| 3:18:25| us. We've offered that we would pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11905)|
| 3:18:27| for one-third of the cost of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11907)|
| 3:18:29| They have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11909)|
| 3:18:31| not expressed an interest in that at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11911)|
| 3:18:33| point in time due to some funding constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11913)|
| 3:18:35| They actually reached out to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11915)|
| 3:18:37| us about safety projects in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11917)|
| 3:18:39| our region, and this was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11919)|
| 3:18:41| the number one project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11921)|
| 3:18:43| that we mentioned to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11923)|
| 3:18:45| The problem is those funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11925)|
| 3:18:47| have time frames attached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11927)|
| 3:18:49| to them, and due to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11929)|
| 3:18:51| right-of-way acquisitions and possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11931)|
| 3:18:53| permitting due to the hydrology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11933)|
| 3:18:55| that project was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11935)|
| 3:18:57| denied by TDOT, but it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11937)|
| 3:18:59| is one that is very high on our priority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11939)|
| 3:19:01| list. We're very aware of the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11941)|
| 3:19:03| What would be the total amount of doing that project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11943)|
| 3:19:05| You said we would be open to a third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11945)|
| 3:19:07| What's the total?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11947)|
| 3:19:09| We examined two different alternatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11949)|
| 3:19:11| a roundabout and a traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11951)|
| 3:19:13| signal with turn lanes, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11953)|
| 3:19:15| due to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11955)|
| 3:19:17| turning movement volumes, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11957)|
| 3:19:19| traffic signal with turn lanes worked a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11959)|
| 3:19:21| better. I mean, I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11961)|
| 3:19:23| estimate to put turn lanes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11963)|
| 3:19:25| on all three approaches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11965)|
| 3:19:27| put in a traffic signal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11967)|
| 3:19:29| You're probably looking somewhere in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11969)|
| 3:19:31| $800 to $1 million range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11971)|
| 3:19:33| Is this a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11973)|
| 3:19:35| project that if Knox County wanted to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11975)|
| 3:19:37| in its totality, it could ask the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11977)|
| 3:19:39| to give us permission to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11979)|
| 3:19:41| without them? Yes, they would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11981)|
| 3:19:43| be willing to work with us in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11983)|
| 3:19:45| Very much so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11985)|
| 3:19:47| So you feel like if we could obtain that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11987)|
| 3:19:49| money internally, we could do it without them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11989)|
| 3:19:51| Yes, yes. That's what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11991)|
| 3:19:53| we did with partnership with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11993)|
| 3:19:55| SmithBuild on Emory at Kate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11995)|
| 3:19:57| The state's really good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11997)|
| 3:19:59| to work with. We're good partners with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=11999)|
| 3:20:01| them, and they would certainly look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12001)|
| 3:20:03| fondly upon that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12003)|
| 3:20:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12005)|

| 3:20:49| We're actually across from the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12049)|
| 3:20:51| that's been discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12051)|
| 3:20:53| In 2003,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12053)|
| 3:20:55| we moved across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12055)|
| 3:20:57| from this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12057)|
| 3:20:59| Three weeks later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12059)|
| 3:21:01| it flooded all the way up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12061)|
| 3:21:03| to Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12063)|
| 3:21:05| Do you remember the big flood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12065)|
| 3:21:07| Forest Ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12067)|
| 3:21:09| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12069)|
| 3:21:11| troubles there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12071)|
| 3:21:13| We were involved with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12073)|
| 3:21:15| Our daughter lived there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12075)|
| 3:21:17| Anyway, that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12077)|
| 3:21:19| the first time I saw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12079)|
| 3:21:21| We keep talking about the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12081)|
| 3:21:23| 2019 and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12083)|
| 3:21:25| 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12085)|
| 3:21:27| The floods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12087)|
| 3:21:29| came all the way to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12089)|
| 3:21:31| Emory Road again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12091)|
| 3:21:33| We didn't keep records| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12093)|
| 3:21:35| because we were told that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12095)|
| 3:21:37| was the flood area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12097)|
| 3:21:39| So, it was just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12099)|
| 3:21:41| something that happened there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12101)|
| 3:21:43| and you just knew it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12103)|
| 3:21:45| going to happen. But surprisingly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12105)|
| 3:21:47| sometimes you thought it was going to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12107)|
| 3:21:49| and it didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12109)|
| 3:21:51| But, I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12111)|
| 3:21:53| tell you it went up to Emory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12113)|
| 3:21:55| Road between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12115)|
| 3:21:57| 2003 and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12117)|
| 3:21:59| 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12119)|
| 3:22:01| More times than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12121)|
| 3:22:03| you would know. I've seen it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12123)|
| 3:22:05| pace the 100 and the 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12125)|
| 3:22:07| The other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12127)|
| 3:22:09| thing is that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12129)|
| 3:22:11| did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12131)|
| 3:22:13| went online and learned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12133)|
| 3:22:15| that, according| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12135)|
| 3:22:17| to FEMA, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12137)|
| 3:22:19| is a 6 out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12139)|

| 3:22:23| high risk for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12143)|
| 3:22:25| flooding. They| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12145)|
| 3:22:27| predict that there will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12147)|
| 3:22:29| more flooding on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12149)|

| 3:23:39| of flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12219)|

| 3:23:55| on the front end instead of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12235)|
| 3:23:57| keeping the concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12237)|
| 3:23:59| and volunteering that information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12239)|
| 3:24:01| so we can squash some of these concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12241)|
| 3:24:03| Again, they've done the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12243)|
| 3:24:05| We've run the math, we've got the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12245)|

| 3:24:17| from any of the commissioners here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12257)|

| 3:24:29| And I walked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12269)|
| 3:24:31| down to the, right at the barn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12271)|

| 3:24:35| even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12275)|

| 3:24:47| that no more water run off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12287)|
| 3:24:49| the property now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12289)|

| 3:24:55| Even if it does that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12295)|
| 3:24:57| according to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12297)|
| 3:24:59| Mr. Snowden, we're only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12299)|
| 3:25:01| going to raise it about a half a foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12301)|
| 3:25:03| because we already got the other foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12303)|
| 3:25:05| built in. What do you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12305)|
| 3:25:07| say about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12307)|
| 3:25:09| Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12309)|
| 3:25:11| I know the professionals say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12311)|
| 3:25:15| there's no guarantee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12315)|
| 3:25:17| There's nothing supposed to be past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12317)|
| 3:25:19| that red line. We keep hearing about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12319)|
| 3:25:21| this red line, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12321)|

| 3:25:25| And some of the homes that we have plans for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12325)|
| 3:25:27| actually have some of those back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12327)|
| 3:25:29| homes in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12329)|

| 3:25:35| that we've looked at and the maps that we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12335)|
| 3:25:37| been provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12337)|
| 3:25:39| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12339)|
| 3:25:41| we're greatly concerned about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12341)|
| 3:25:43| And there's no guarantee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12343)|
| 3:25:45| there is not going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12345)|
| 3:25:47| any shunting, I mean, unless Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12347)|
| 3:25:49| Sanderson, I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12349)|
| 3:25:51| being dismissive or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12351)|
| 3:25:53| want to guarantee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12353)|
| 3:25:55| the community and those homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12355)|
| 3:25:57| they're not going to have flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12357)|
| 3:25:59| problems. I don't know that anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12359)|
| 3:26:01| is going to guarantee that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12361)|
| 3:26:03| So, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12363)|
| 3:26:05| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12365)|
| 3:26:07| Is it a gamble?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12367)|
| 3:26:09| Yeah, toss the dice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12369)|
| 3:26:11| and see what you get, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12371)|
| 3:26:13| We all got traffic problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12373)|
| 3:26:15| I understand. Come out in my neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12375)|
| 3:26:17| at 24 and 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12377)|
| 3:26:19| come to Stock Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12379)|
| 3:26:21| when Tennessee River backs up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12381)|
| 3:26:23| Stock Creek backs up, it backs up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12383)|
| 3:26:25| it floods all the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12385)|
| 3:26:27| up at the library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12387)|
| 3:26:29| We all got that type of problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12389)|
| 3:26:31| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12391)|
| 3:26:33| we've got 19 places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12393)|
| 3:26:35| in Beaver Creek that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12395)|
| 3:26:37| so-called dammed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12397)|
| 3:26:39| A lot more than that. Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12399)|
| 3:26:41| A lot more than that. A lot more than that, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12401)|
| 3:26:43| We've heard the number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12403)|
| 3:26:45| 19, so that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12405)|
| 3:26:47| Well, I seen the one at the bridge yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12407)|
| 3:26:49| Pretty little waterfall there. Is it the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12409)|
| 3:26:51| little beaver? I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12411)|
| 3:26:53| The one-lane bridge there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12413)|
| 3:26:55| Oh, yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12415)|
| 3:26:57| That waterfall at the one-lane bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12417)|
| 3:26:59| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12419)|
| 3:27:01| I...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12421)|
| 3:27:03| So, you don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12423)|
| 3:27:05| want Smithville to build anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12425)|
| 3:27:07| You know, even a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12427)|
| 3:27:09| concession, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12429)|
| 3:27:11| could do two units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12431)|
| 3:27:13| Two units an acre. I know that's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12433)|
| 3:27:15| going to be hugely profitable for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12435)|
| 3:27:17| but when you build less homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12437)|
| 3:27:19| you also decrease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12439)|
| 3:27:21| the soil erosion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12441)|
| 3:27:23| with that, and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12443)|
| 3:27:25| soil erosion then adds to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12445)|
| 3:27:27| all that water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12447)|
| 3:27:29| going back into, and the dirt going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12449)|
| 3:27:31| back into the creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12451)|
| 3:27:33| and then adding water to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12453)|
| 3:27:35| Does that sound about right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12455)|
| 3:27:37| In a very simplistic way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12457)|
| 3:27:39| Where did I see, maybe you can answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12459)|
| 3:27:41| or Josh can answer, the 2.8?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12461)|
| 3:27:43| Where did you see what? I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12463)|
| 3:27:45| 2.8 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12465)|
| 3:27:47| I know it says three, but somewhere...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12467)|
| 3:27:49| Yeah, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12469)|
| 3:27:51| some of that is very confusing because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12471)|
| 3:27:53| the Metropolitan Planning Commission said this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12473)|
| 3:27:55| I think Mr. Sanderson said something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12475)|
| 3:27:57| else. Then we did the math and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12477)|
| 3:27:59| numbers, and then the engineers did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12479)|
| 3:28:01| other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12481)|
| 3:28:03| So, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12483)|
| 3:28:05| we don't have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12485)|
| 3:28:07| specific, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12487)|
| 3:28:09| is what we're doing. Would that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12489)|
| 3:28:11| be correct, Josh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12491)|
| 3:28:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12493)|
| 3:28:17| I originally sent out an email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12497)|
| 3:28:19| saying we have a 30 acre farm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12499)|
| 3:28:21| on paper. We have a 30 acre farm, take flood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12501)|
| 3:28:23| take everything out of it. We have two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12503)|
| 3:28:25| parcels that equal 30 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12505)|
| 3:28:27| and we have a concept for 42| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12507)|
| 3:28:29| houses. So I did the math,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12509)|
| 3:28:31| there's like 1.86| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12511)|
| 3:28:33| units per acre, and I sent that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12513)|
| 3:28:35| The neighbors were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12515)|
| 3:28:37| we discussed it this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12517)|
| 3:28:39| and that was kind of misleading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12519)|
| 3:28:41| because Knox County does not let you zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12521)|
| 3:28:43| the flood area. So, me saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12523)|
| 3:28:45| there's a 30 acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12525)|
| 3:28:47| farm and we're only doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12527)|
| 3:28:49| 42 acres or 42 lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12529)|
| 3:28:51| is kind of misleading. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12531)|
| 3:28:53| on paper, that's the truth, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12533)|
| 3:28:55| Knox County will only let me zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12535)|
| 3:28:57| so much above the flood and so much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12537)|
| 3:28:59| a little bit in the flood. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12539)|
| 3:29:01| I think on this particular track, it's 11.08| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12541)|
| 3:29:03| acres is what Leo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12543)|
| 3:29:05| and Knox County staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12545)|
| 3:29:07| calculated, and at three units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12547)|
| 3:29:09| that'd be 33 homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12549)|
| 3:29:11| and I think we only have 23. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12551)|
| 3:29:13| when I ran back the numbers, I sent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12553)|
| 3:29:15| out an email again saying this thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12555)|
| 3:29:17| on paper, above| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12557)|
| 3:29:19| the flood, would be like 2.8 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12559)|
| 3:29:21| per acre, once we get the exact survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12561)|
| 3:29:23| and exactly how much it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12563)|
| 3:29:25| Are you talking about both parcels? I'm talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12565)|
| 3:29:27| both parcels. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12567)|

| 3:29:31| And I'm jumping ahead with both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12571)|
| 3:29:33| parcels. What about this one parcel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12573)|
| 3:29:35| That's what I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12575)|

| 3:30:11| is the development. If we say five acres, we can put those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12611)|
| 3:30:13| based on every math problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12613)|

| 3:31:03| forward with the zoning of three units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210329-combined?start=12663)|
