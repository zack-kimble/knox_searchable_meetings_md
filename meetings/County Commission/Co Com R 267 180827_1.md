| 2:56:31| Speak for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10591)|
| 2:56:35| Vote to go ahead with one, which is the lesser of all intrusion on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10595)|
| 2:56:41| We don't let this thing go to phase two and phase three with the expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10601)|
| 2:56:45| Enough's enough, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10605)|
| 2:56:47| We've lived with this for years and years, but times have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10607)|
| 2:56:52| This is a neighborhood they're coming into now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10612)|
| 2:56:57| Not agriculture, not farm, but a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10617)|
| 2:57:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10620)|
| 2:57:01| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10621)|
| 2:57:03| Mr. Chairman, Pastor Ford, do you have anyone else that would wish to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10623)|
| 2:57:07| Because you still have seven minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10627)|
| 2:57:09| Anyone else want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10629)|
| 2:57:10| Anyone else want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10630)|
| 2:57:11| Come on, brother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10631)|
| 2:57:23| Hi there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10643)|
| 2:57:24| Dan Anderson at 3050 Cox Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10644)|
| 2:57:28| My property butts up to the bluffs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10648)|
| 2:57:32| As we moved into this area, we were told about the walking land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10652)|
| 2:57:40| and the caves and stuff that are around that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10660)|
| 2:57:44| My property butts up to some of those areas that we can get into the caves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10664)|
| 2:57:49| and things that go all the way across Thorn Grove Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10669)|
| 2:57:54| that go all the way up to the church and stuff up Thorn Grove Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10674)|
| 2:58:00| These are areas that if the blasting keeps coming forward, how can they not be affected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10680)|
| 2:58:10| Are we going to close down some of the history and stuff that are inside those caves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10690)|
| 2:58:15| because of it being called the walking lands that the Indians and stuff used to use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10695)|
| 2:58:22| The part of my bluffs that are there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10702)|
| 2:58:25| I have several things that are on them like decks and things of this sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10705)|
| 2:58:30| If those bluffs start giving away, what's going to happen to my home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10710)|
| 2:58:36| What's going to happen to the area around us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10716)|
| 2:58:40| We've got to say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10720)|
| 2:58:44| If you look at Mascot, the Quarry of Mascot, how close are the homes there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10724)|
| 2:58:50| I can tell you right now, they're nowhere to be seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10730)|
| 2:58:55| How close are the homes at the one in out West Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10735)|
| 2:59:02| Not close to be seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10742)|
| 2:59:04| You're putting a rock quarry beside homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10744)|
| 2:59:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10750)|
| 2:59:14| Yes, sir, if you would please give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10754)|
| 2:59:17| Wayne McMahon, 2954 Fulver Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10757)|
| 2:59:22| I think one of the things that Annette, that Ms. Brogdon, wasn't able to tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10762)|
| 2:59:29| was that it's the view, you can't buy a view that she's got across the river,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10769)|
| 2:59:36| of the river, of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10776)|
| 2:59:38| It's just beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10778)|
| 2:59:41| The caves and the bluff, and there's so much history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10781)|
| 2:59:45| I've been there all my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10785)|
| 2:59:46| My mom's been there all her life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10786)|
| 2:59:48| It goes back generations and generations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10788)|
| 2:59:52| That's all I've got to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10792)|
| 2:59:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10795)|
| 2:59:56| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10796)|
| 2:59:57| Is there anyone else from the opposition that wishes to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10797)|
| 3:00:07| Does the applicant wish to rebuttal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10807)|
| 3:00:11| It's not really rebuttal, Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10811)|
| 3:00:13| but I think as a result of this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10813)|
| 3:00:18| people that live in the Marbledale community know these gentlemen here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10818)|
| 3:00:22| They know how to get a hold of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10822)|
| 3:00:25| They are more than willing to talk to them at any time about any issues they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10825)|
| 3:00:31| and look forward to doing that as we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10831)|
| 3:00:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10834)|
| 3:00:37| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10837)|
| 3:00:40| Phase two and three, does it intrude farther into residential area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10840)|
| 3:00:44| or is that agricultural land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10844)|
| 3:00:46| It's all agricultural land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10846)|
| 3:00:47| Quarries in Knox County can be in either agriculturally zoned property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10847)|
| 3:00:53| industrially zoned property, or CB zoned property, which is a commercial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10853)|
| 3:01:03| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10863)|
| 3:01:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10864)|
| 3:01:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10865)|
| 3:01:06| Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10866)|
| 3:01:07| Phase one will be to do vegetation along John Sevier Highway and Thorn Grove Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10867)|
| 3:01:13| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10873)|
| 3:01:14| And I believe the height of some of the berms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10874)|
| 3:01:16| What about on the other side road at Asbury?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10876)|
| 3:01:18| Is that included or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10878)|
| 3:01:21| I don't think it is, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10881)|
| 3:01:22| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10882)|
| 3:01:23| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10883)|
| 3:01:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10884)|
| 3:01:25| Just on John Sevier Highway along Thorn Grove Pipe, that's phase one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10885)|
| 3:01:27| And if we approve phase one tonight to do all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10887)|
| 3:01:31| they have to come back to MPC, request for phase two, which can be turned down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10891)|
| 3:01:37| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10897)|
| 3:01:38| That's, you know, to me to look at, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10898)|
| 3:01:41| to make John Sevier Highway and Thorn Grove Pike better, it's better to look better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10901)|
| 3:01:46| We need to approve phase one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10906)|
| 3:01:49| And then in two years, you know, that's where the question comes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10909)|
| 3:01:52| do we approve phase two if I'm here or whoever's here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10912)|
| 3:01:56| That's, you know, I go that way every Sunday to church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10916)|
| 3:02:01| and I've already spoken to Blue Water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10921)|
| 3:02:05| You know, I think it looks like a war zone, and they've already agreed to fix that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10925)|
| 3:02:09| And so I'm in favor of phase one, getting the vegetation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10929)|
| 3:02:14| get it to look like there's trees, mountains, or a hill there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10934)|
| 3:02:18| and then in the future we'll have to discuss phase two in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10938)|
| 3:02:23| And I think that's what Mr. Ford, I think that's what Mr. Ford was trying to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10943)|
| 3:02:27| Is that correct, Pastor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10947)|
| 3:02:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10949)|
| 3:02:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10950)|
| 3:02:34| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10954)|
| 3:02:35| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10955)|
| 3:02:37| Yes, I just want to reemphasize what Commissioner Daley said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10957)|
| 3:02:41| and I was at the meeting at Marble Dale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10961)|
| 3:02:44| and I understand the concerns in my heart for the residents out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10964)|
| 3:02:53| and I realize how close it is, and also for the ones who work with the Corps, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10973)|
| 3:03:00| So just to say for tonight to go ahead and okay phase one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10980)|
| 3:03:11| and then like Commissioner Daley said, when it comes back again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10991)|
| 3:03:16| then we'll address those issues for phase two and three of what's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=10996)|
| 3:03:22| how these next two years progress in terms of what's being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11002)|
| 3:03:29| Commissioner Meisner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11009)|
| 3:03:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11011)|
| 3:03:33| To the applicant, and this may have been in a document I read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11013)|
| 3:03:37| how many years exactly have you all been in business at this site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11017)|
| 3:03:42| I just kind of want to get an understanding of how many years you've been operating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11022)|
| 3:03:46| how is the neighborhoods, how have things kind of evolved over the last 20, 30, 40, 50 years in that site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11026)|
| 3:03:53| And also thank you, Commissioner Daley, for kind of clarifying this question of one versus two versus three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11033)|
| 3:04:01| But if you could kind of just specify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11041)|
| 3:04:04| I will confess, Commissioner Nystrom, the life of this quarry spans my legal career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11044)|
| 3:04:09| When I got out of the Army and returned to practice law in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11049)|
| 3:04:13| I started working on the initial application for this quarry on the west side, which was 1972,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11053)|
| 3:04:22| and the quarry has been operational on the west side until 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11062)|
| 3:04:32| The plant remains on the west side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11072)|
| 3:04:34| That's where all the material is processed, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11074)|
| 3:04:38| and the mining takes place on the east side and the stone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11078)|
| 3:04:44| after running through a primary crusher on the east side just so it can go through the regular crushers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11084)|
| 3:04:50| is transported by a conveyor belt to the west side where all the processing of the material occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11090)|
| 3:04:58| To round off, we're talking almost 50 years that the site's been in some way, shape, or form operational out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11098)|
| 3:05:04| I'll confess to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11104)|
| 3:05:05| Okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11105)|
| 3:05:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11108)|
| 3:05:09| And has the neighborhood kind of grown into the site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11109)|
| 3:05:11| Is that sort of, have we seen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11111)|
| 3:05:13| I'm just kind of curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11113)|
| 3:05:14| I guess this is a chicken and egg kind of question, you know, the growth pattern out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11114)|
| 3:05:19| And some of Carson or Dave have been out there, but I want to shed some light on this, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11119)|
| 3:05:24| But that's the end of my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11124)|
| 3:05:27| I think most of these homes have been out there for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11127)|
| 3:05:32| I can't say how many have been built within the past 50 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11132)|
| 3:05:36| but that's been an active community in Marbledale for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11136)|
| 3:05:42| And the mining industry, or the surface mining industry in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11142)|
| 3:05:47| has been active in that area for a number of years right across the road from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11147)|
| 3:05:54| There is a permitted quarry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11154)|
| 3:05:56| East Tennessee Industries, they take out some sort of specialty stone there, not aggregates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11156)|
| 3:06:03| But if you look at an aerial photograph of that area, there is a vein of stone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11163)|
| 3:06:10| It starts somewhere out in Blount County, doesn't it, Walt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11170)|
| 3:06:13| and comes across that part of Knox County and goes on up into Granger County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11173)|
| 3:06:18| That actually is a quarry that is sometime operated for dimension stone or marble up in Granger County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11178)|
| 3:06:28| Yes, sir, did you want to add something, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11188)|
| 3:06:30| Speaking of that mic right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11190)|
| 3:06:32| To answer his question, there was homes on that road, Fogger Lane, before the West Plank was built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11192)|
| 3:06:43| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11203)|
| 3:06:46| Before it ever started on the west side, we opposed it up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11206)|
| 3:06:52| Sir, you have to come down to the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11212)|
| 3:06:55| He's handicapped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11215)|
| 3:07:01| Yeah, you can sit right there. That would be good, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11221)|
| 3:07:04| If you would, please give your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11224)|
| 3:07:08| My name is James Swagger at E2924 Fogger Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11228)|
| 3:07:16| I've lived at my home on Fogger Lane for 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11236)|
| 3:07:22| The quarry has not been in operation on this property anywhere near 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11242)|
| 3:07:34| I will get the exact date, but it hasn't been in operation that long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11254)|
| 3:07:41| He's talking about quarries back into the 1800s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11261)|
| 3:07:45| They were, but they were marble quarries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11265)|
| 3:07:49| There wasn't any blasting involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11269)|
| 3:07:53| But myself, Mrs. Brogdon, and Mr. Fulver, we've all lived on Fogger Lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11273)|
| 3:08:00| long before the quarry was even established on the west side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11280)|
| 3:08:06| And we opposed this move to the east side of John Sevier to no avail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11286)|
| 3:08:12| but I just want everybody to know that their homes and their livelihoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11292)|
| 3:08:23| and we are going to object vigorously to phase two and three of this operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11303)|
| 3:08:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11315)|
| 3:08:36| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11316)|
| 3:08:37| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11317)|
| 3:08:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11319)|
| 3:08:40| I couldn't see heads from this distance from the opposition or the homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11320)|
| 3:08:46| I just want to make sure that the homeowners are in favor of phase one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11326)|
| 3:08:52| and all 15 conditions that are before us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11332)|
| 3:08:56| So if somebody could just say yes or no, but I can't see shaking of heads from where I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11336)|
| 3:09:02| You're in favor of, okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11342)|
| 3:09:06| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11346)|
| 3:09:07| I mean, I'm sorry, Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11347)|
| 3:09:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11350)|
| 3:09:12| I guess I'm confused here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11352)|
| 3:09:15| If there's no support for phase two and phase three, why are we supporting phase one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11355)|
| 3:09:21| That just leads to phase two and phase three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11361)|
| 3:09:27| And I ask that question to you, citizens, because you're supporting phase one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11367)|
| 3:09:34| If I could, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11374)|
| 3:09:37| Phase one, MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11377)|
| 3:09:40| Phase one was kind of a compromise that we came up with with a dialogue with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11380)|
| 3:09:46| that gave them Burtbrook Lane, if you can look at the map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11386)|
| 3:09:51| Burtbrook Lane right straight across to the river was a compromise with the mine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11391)|
| 3:09:58| and with where they already had the state permit at that time to mine that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11398)|
| 3:10:08| And it doesn't, all the properties off of, that they have just bought that come off of Fall River Lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11408)|
| 3:10:15| are like six or seven acre tracks, and they stop at Burtbrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11415)|
| 3:10:20| Close?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11420)|
| 3:10:21| At the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11421)|
| 3:10:22| At the end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11422)|
| 3:10:23| And that was the line across through there that we were willing to live with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11423)|
| 3:10:27| that gave them seven or eight more acres, but it doesn't intrude in then on Fall River Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11427)|
| 3:10:34| Compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11434)|
| 3:10:35| Well, I don't see how this lady's compromising about her house shaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11435)|
| 3:10:40| and the dishes and the glasses shaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11440)|
| 3:10:42| I don't understand how you would approve more action like you're getting now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11442)|
| 3:10:50| and think that's a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11450)|
| 3:10:52| I mean, if I heard her correctly when she was crying here, she's really upset about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11452)|
| 3:10:56| and it's not good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11456)|
| 3:10:58| We'll support you if you vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11458)|
| 3:11:03| I think I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11463)|
| 3:11:05| And, sir, if I may, some of the items in Phase 1, the conditions apply to re-vegetation of the berms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11465)|
| 3:11:14| making, softening the impact, and unfortunately some of the blasting is occurring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11474)|
| 3:11:21| because of the current operation, not because of expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11481)|
| 3:11:25| And regardless of what we do with Phase 1, the quarry will continue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11485)|
| 3:11:32| and I'm assuming will continue in operation where it is, and that blasting will continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11492)|
| 3:11:36| We're hoping that with vegetation of some of those berms, improving the buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11496)|
| 3:11:42| that maybe that impact will be lessened somewhat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11502)|
| 3:11:46| And we can't go back and redo the decisions that were made in 1970| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11506)|
| 3:11:52| or whenever the date was that started the quarry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11512)|
| 3:11:55| but we can try to, to the extent we can, mitigate the impacts that are there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11515)|
| 3:12:02| Commissioner Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11522)|
| 3:12:04| I think it was Ms. Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11524)|
| 3:12:06| Was it you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11526)|
| 3:12:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11527)|
| 3:12:09| I'd like to speak to that issue, and I'd like to respond to some of what the community has said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11529)|
| 3:12:14| because the length of time the quarry has been present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11534)|
| 3:12:19| it's only to the point that we come to the expansion that we want to look at vegetation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11539)|
| 3:12:26| and issues of mitigation to deal with some of the concerns of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11546)|
| 3:12:31| But for years we decided not to do anything, planting trees, planting growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11551)|
| 3:12:39| and making any sort of remediation to help support the needs of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11559)|
| 3:12:45| So at the moment they want to expand the plant, then we have 15 requirements under MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11565)|
| 3:12:51| but no will prior to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11571)|
| 3:12:55| And the only time MPC can take action is when an application comes before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11575)|
| 3:12:59| If there's any requirement for anything before that, it lies on the county's lap, not MPC's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11579)|
| 3:13:05| Right. I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11585)|
| 3:13:08| So then they did not see a need to plant any vegetation, none whatsoever, prior to the moment of expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11588)|
| 3:13:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11601)|
| 3:13:22| I suppose they weren't asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11602)|
| 3:13:26| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11606)|
| 3:13:29| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11609)|
| 3:13:30| May I respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11610)|
| 3:13:34| We weren't asked to by any of the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11614)|
| 3:13:37| These folks here, this is the first time that we're aware of that's come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11617)|
| 3:13:43| We weren't required to by any of our permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11623)|
| 3:13:46| And when I say we, we now is a different group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11626)|
| 3:13:50| Blue Water Industries is a new company that owns and operates this site as of December 30, 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11630)|
| 3:13:56| So us four gentlemen here, when all this was back in the 70s in 2003 when they moved across the road and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11636)|
| 3:14:03| we weren't a part of those companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11643)|
| 3:14:05| I have no idea what went on with those people and what their decisions were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11645)|
| 3:14:09| why they didn't do it other than the fact that they weren't required to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11649)|
| 3:14:13| But at this point, we're Blue Water Industries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11653)|
| 3:14:17| We've gone for this expansion and through the process with MPC and the dialogue with the neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11657)|
| 3:14:23| we're doing it, and it's going to get done, and it's going to get done right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11663)|
| 3:14:29| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11669)|
| 3:14:30| Yes, but you said you've owned it since 2014?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11670)|
| 3:14:34| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11674)|
| 3:14:35| Blue Water Industries bought this site December 30, 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11675)|
| 3:14:39| That hasn't happened yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11679)|
| 3:14:41| Oh, 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11681)|
| 3:14:44| Back to the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11684)|
| 3:14:45| I've been watching too many D.C. Legends of Tomorrow on Netflix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11685)|
| 3:14:50| So when was the actual date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11690)|
| 3:14:52| December 30, 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11692)|
| 3:14:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11694)|
| 3:14:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11695)|
| 3:14:56| But you saw no need to do any of that when you bought it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11696)|
| 3:15:02| Well, when our owners bought the company, we were in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11702)|
| 3:15:06| I was putting together this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11706)|
| 3:15:08| I just didn't have it together until March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11708)|
| 3:15:09| For the expansion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11709)|
| 3:15:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11710)|
| 3:15:11| I got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11711)|
| 3:15:12| Yeah, it took me until March to get it all together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11712)|
| 3:15:13| There was a lot of mapping work and stuff I had to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11713)|
| 3:15:18| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11718)|
| 3:15:21| The berm that's suddenly in question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11721)|
| 3:15:24| the landscaping on that berm looked tremendously different a year or two ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11724)|
| 3:15:28| There was a power line that needed to be relocated to get prepared for the expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11728)|
| 3:15:34| It needed to be moved off of the mining area and moved to the outside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11734)|
| 3:15:38| and that's the new power poles and the lines you see down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11738)|
| 3:15:42| Well, as part of that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11742)|
| 3:15:43| the power company came through there and removed all of the existing vegetation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11743)|
| 3:15:48| which was quite a bit higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11748)|
| 3:15:50| and provided a much different barrier a year or two ago than what you see today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11750)|
| 3:15:57| Now the power company is done, and the first planting season we had is coming up in October,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11757)|
| 3:16:02| and as Walt said, we're going to replant it and start the process over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11762)|
| 3:16:07| But what you see today is not what it's looked like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11767)|
| 3:16:12| When was the power line moved exactly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11772)|
| 3:16:16| At the end of 2017 is when the power line was actually relocated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11776)|
| 3:16:20| and all that vegetation at the base of the berm was removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11780)|
| 3:16:24| If you ride through there now, you can see where they just mulched,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11784)|
| 3:16:27| basically the vegetation that was there and left mulch piles and things at the base of the berm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11787)|
| 3:16:32| But I think that's the big thing that is really highlighting this issue right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11792)|
| 3:16:37| is that that landscape has changed tremendously because of the relocation of that power line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11797)|
| 3:16:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11804)|
| 3:16:47| I was looking at all the KGIS, all the other quarries in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11807)|
| 3:16:55| and this particular one, without the expansion, has residential areas close to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11815)|
| 3:17:05| Honestly, it doesn't seem like a good place to expand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11825)|
| 3:17:08| I understand you're there now, and that's what you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11828)|
| 3:17:11| And I don't understand approving Phase 1 if you don't want 2 and 3, because that's coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11831)|
| 3:17:17| and it's going to shake more, and it's going to get worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11837)|
| 3:17:22| So I don't know if maybe the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11842)|
| 3:17:28| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11848)|
| 3:17:34| It just seems like that 2 and 3, you'll be gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11854)|
| 3:17:47| Mr. Chairman, can he use the microphone every time he speaks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11867)|
| 3:17:51| so the people in the audience can understand what's going on and makes it easier for the county clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11871)|
| 3:17:56| I apologize. I'm used to preaching, and they can usually hear me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11876)|
| 3:18:01| but this is not a church, so I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11881)|
| 3:18:05| The MPC hearing, as I thought what was coming tonight was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11885)|
| 3:18:11| none of this conversation would be held about Phase 2 and 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11891)|
| 3:18:14| This was just up and down vote on Phase 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11894)|
| 3:18:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11897)|
| 3:18:18| I thought Phase 2 and 3 were completely off the table, and they had to reapply as if they didn't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11898)|
| 3:18:26| So that's why we were trying to say we could live with that if that's all we ever have to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11906)|
| 3:18:33| I love what they're doing to the cosmetics, but that's not the issue to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11913)|
| 3:18:38| That's fine as long as they stay right where they are and don't advance and don't extend the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11918)|
| 3:18:44| That's what we're for. Amen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11924)|
| 3:18:50| No more of the expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11930)|
| 3:18:56| I like what they're doing to take the landscape,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11936)|
| 3:19:00| and they're talking about doing some creative stuff that we've met with them on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11940)|
| 3:19:04| about the Marble Hill community and the flower bed and those type of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11944)|
| 3:19:08| Those things are fine, but our issue is, Commissioner Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11948)|
| 3:19:12| and we didn't think, to be honest with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11952)|
| 3:19:15| I didn't think we had a Chinaman's chance of stopping 1, 2, and 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11955)|
| 3:19:22| But 2 and 3 are still on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11962)|
| 3:19:25| No, they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11965)|
| 3:19:26| In their plans, they are or they aren't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11966)|
| 3:19:28| They're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11968)|
| 3:19:32| Okay. I hear you. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11972)|
| 3:19:37| I mean, it's in their corporate plans, and that's a question that needs to be answered here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11977)|
| 3:19:44| Is it in the official plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11984)|
| 3:19:47| Do they have to just come back and say, I want 2 and 3, or do they have to reapply for the whole thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11987)|
| 3:19:51| They have to reapply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11991)|
| 3:19:54| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11994)|
| 3:19:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11996)|
| 3:19:58| This is the way I see it, and I hope I'm seeing it the way that I, if I live there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=11998)|
| 3:20:03| I go by there every Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12003)|
| 3:20:06| Blue Water does not, if this is defeated, Blue Water does not have to do any landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12006)|
| 3:20:12| They can leave it like it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12012)|
| 3:20:13| It can be rocks, no new fencing, anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12013)|
| 3:20:19| Phase 1, I would vote for Phase 1 to have them do the new fencing, the trees, the grass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12019)|
| 3:20:29| make sure the berms are in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12029)|
| 3:20:31| But that does not give them a guarantee that when they come back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12031)|
| 3:20:34| or if they come back in two years, that they're going to get 2 and 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12034)|
| 3:20:38| There's not a guarantee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12038)|
| 3:20:39| This issue right now, as I see it, I would rather see them go ahead and do the berm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12039)|
| 3:20:48| plant the trees, and make it look presentable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12048)|
| 3:20:52| That's part of what the good Johnsonville Highway Corridor study is all about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12052)|
| 3:20:55| is trying to make that, that is a scenic highway and a scenic parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12055)|
| 3:21:00| It is not a scenic parkway right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12060)|
| 3:21:03| And they're trying, these gentlemen, I believe, are trying to improve that process now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12063)|
| 3:21:08| I don't know if they would agree to go ahead, and if Phase 1 is voted down tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12068)|
| 3:21:13| if they would agree to go ahead and do the berm and plant the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12073)|
| 3:21:16| I don't know about that, but that's, you know, as I see it right now, the way it's presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12076)|
| 3:21:22| I would rather see vegetation, new fencing, new safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12082)|
| 3:21:28| because kids will go to quarries and jump off quarries and die every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12088)|
| 3:21:33| just because kids are kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12093)|
| 3:21:35| So I would, that's where I stand, and I hope it explains to Mr. Brantley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12095)|
| 3:21:40| that I would rather see trees and grass instead of just nothing but rocks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12100)|
| 3:21:49| Commissioner Bustler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12109)|
| 3:21:51| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12111)|
| 3:21:54| Question to Blue Water here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12114)|
| 3:21:56| You have in control right now, you have three quarries, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12116)|
| 3:22:01| You have one on Raccoon Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12121)|
| 3:22:05| You have this at Marveldale, and then what's the other one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12125)|
| 3:22:09| At Mascot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12129)|
| 3:22:10| At Mascot, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12130)|
| 3:22:12| Was those, when did you take possession of those other units that you all have under Blue Water now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12132)|
| 3:22:20| Because I think the one on, and I'm trying to get this timeline down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12140)|
| 3:22:25| the one on Raccoon Valley was under U.S. Aggregate, was that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12145)|
| 3:22:29| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12149)|
| 3:22:30| Aggregates USA owned the companies from February 5, 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12150)|
| 3:22:36| and they sold the Vulcan Materials Company on December 29, 2017,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12156)|
| 3:22:41| and the federal government, for competition reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12161)|
| 3:22:43| made Vulcan Materials sell off the old Aggregates USA quarries in East Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12163)|
| 3:22:48| and the one in Virginia the following day on the 30th when Blue Water bought us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12168)|
| 3:22:52| Okay, and Reverend Ford, you said something about that you had an agreement with the company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12172)|
| 3:23:00| to stop their development on this quarry at, was it Burke Brooks Lane?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12180)|
| 3:23:09| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12189)|
| 3:23:12| That is, Burke Brooks Lane is where Phase 1 line is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12192)|
| 3:23:16| So that's where it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12196)|
| 3:23:18| That's just a landmark of where Phase 1 line is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12198)|
| 3:23:20| It's just a landmark and that's what, but that agreement you had was with Blue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12200)|
| 3:23:27| That was just what happened with the MPC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12207)|
| 3:23:30| As a result of the MPC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12210)|
| 3:23:32| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12212)|
| 3:23:33| The dialogue we had after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12213)|
| 3:23:35| Okay, so the land right now is zoned where you can use a quarry in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12215)|
| 3:23:46| but it's a U.S. owned review, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12226)|
| 3:23:48| Yes, it's zoned agricultural and then we applied for a U.S. owned review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12228)|
| 3:23:51| to amend our plan of operations to add to acreage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12231)|
| 3:23:56| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12236)|
| 3:24:00| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12240)|
| 3:24:01| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12241)|
| 3:24:05| A couple of different times this evening there's been reference to meetings being held,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12245)|
| 3:24:10| maybe two meetings or two meetings here or two meetings there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12250)|
| 3:24:16| There was actually a meeting earlier in the year just of the citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12256)|
| 3:24:20| at the Riverdale Community Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12260)|
| 3:24:22| Then there was a joint meeting, the developer and the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12262)|
| 3:24:27| I wish to thank Commissioner Gill and Commissioner Carringer for attending that meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12267)|
| 3:24:33| and asking specific questions which have generated answers here this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12273)|
| 3:24:38| so thank you for attending those two meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12278)|
| 3:24:42| Excuse me, you two attending that one meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12282)|
| 3:24:48| No emphasis on the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12288)|
| 3:24:52| It was a sunshined meeting, by the way, and no votes were taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12292)|
| 3:24:56| If there's minutes, you all have got them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12296)|
| 3:25:00| That was at the Marbledale Baptist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12300)|
| 3:25:03| But really where I'm headed to with this is the pair of you asked questions that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12303)|
| 3:25:10| I'm really thankful that kicking off this evening's discussion, Commissioner Daley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12310)|
| 3:25:17| Commissioner Anders, Commissioner Schoonmaker asking some really relevant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12317)|
| 3:25:23| and pertinent questions about the presentation that was made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12323)|
| 3:25:28| taking 15 minutes on the behalf of the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12328)|
| 3:25:34| and then equal time being distributed among the audience on those folks that wish to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12334)|
| 3:25:46| I need to pause for just a second and say we're probably moving from input from the audience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12346)|
| 3:25:54| and now circling our conversation to just commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12354)|
| 3:26:00| Is there anyone else that has any question or would wish to make a comment about this application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12360)|
| 3:26:11| Things that were in the original application marked it as this is one, this is part one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12371)|
| 3:26:23| and then this will be part two, and this is part three of a current one-time application to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12383)|
| 3:26:37| The results of the MPC meeting were that parts two and parts three of the request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12397)|

| 3:26:55| saying that parts two and three are not a part of the application that's before us tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12415)|
| 3:27:02| if that is ever to occur, it will occur in the future with a whole new application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12422)|
| 3:27:11| What's happening, having been by there now several times during the orange and white sign campaign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12431)|
| 3:27:20| there is new fencing currently being installed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12440)|
| 3:27:25| The view of the berm is significant, and it's based on the fact that KUB TVA came through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12445)|
| 3:27:32| and put up big old 100-foot poles and took down every piece of green stuff that was more than a foot tall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12452)|

| 3:27:55| I misspoke, there were 16, there were 15 original, and there was one condition added at the MPC meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12475)|
| 3:28:04| and that condition reads, utilizing native plantings only for the revegetation of the rock berms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12484)|
| 3:28:12| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12492)|

| 3:28:32| with the 16 items of agreement above and beyond the approval of item number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12512)|
| 3:28:46| and without something in charter, ordinance, or code that preclude us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12526)|
| 3:28:55| from going by what is current permissible zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12535)|
| 3:29:00| as presented to us with a recommendation to approve from the MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12540)|
| 3:29:06| that's for item number one only with 16 conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=12546)|

| 3:37:04| Commission, I heard Mr. Davis' comment at the beginning of the meeting about the time that zoning and planning review adds to the approval of items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13024)|
| 3:37:14| You can see tonight from one item the amount of time that we spend trying to work with residents to work out reasonable solutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13034)|
| 3:37:21| and we're sensitive to the time element.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13041)|
| 3:37:24| We hear Mr. Davis' but also today I got an email and a letter from neighbors asking for a two-month delay on a request that MPC is proceeding with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13044)|
| 3:37:35| So we've worked hard to balance those two sides and appreciate the support the Commission has provided for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13055)|
| 3:37:41| We'll continue to look for ways to decrease the time but allow the neighboring property owners to at least know what's going on and have a voice in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13061)|
| 3:37:50| I appreciate your role in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13070)|
| 3:37:53| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13073)|
| 3:37:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13075)|
| 3:37:57| No further business before the zoning board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13077)|
| 3:38:00| We are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13080)|
| 3:38:03| Reconvene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13083)|
| 3:38:04| Knox County regular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13084)|
| 3:38:10| We have six items left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13090)|
| 3:38:12| I say we take a ten-minute break and then come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13092)|
| 3:38:16| Is there any agreement with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13096)|
| 3:38:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13099)|
| 3:38:20| We'll reconvene at 847.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13100)|
| 3:38:37| I call this meeting back to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13117)|
| 3:38:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13123)|
| 3:38:44| We're on item number 48, resolution 904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13124)|
| 3:38:46| It's approving an update to the rules of procedure for the Knox County Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13126)|
| 3:38:52| I have a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13132)|
| 3:38:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13133)|
| 3:38:55| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13135)|
| 3:39:00| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13140)|
| 3:39:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13143)|
| 3:39:04| I'm not sure if the person from the Chair of the Ethics Committee is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13144)|
| 3:39:07| John can probably fill in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13147)|
| 3:39:10| My one question on that was I noticed that there were exceptions in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13150)|
| 3:39:15| You're leaning on your...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13155)|
| 3:39:17| You've got to lose the gut, bud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13157)|
| 3:39:19| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13159)|
| 3:39:20| I was talking about F3, working out all this stuff, and here my gut is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13160)|
| 3:39:23| I'm pushing the button, and I'm like, oh, it silenced me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13163)|
| 3:39:26| But one question, and I just want to get clarification from you, John,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13166)|
| 3:39:30| who you've been our liaison to that committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13170)|
| 3:39:32| and, Bud, you may want to chime in on this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13172)|
| 3:39:36| There was one of the kind of where the pedal hit the road on this one was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13176)|
| 3:39:40| they were talking about some exceptions to be made, say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13180)|
| 3:39:43| if commissioners or folks are invited to nonprofit events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13183)|
| 3:39:49| Then we've also recently added that you can do things up to $50 for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13189)|
| 3:39:54| And I guess my point that my question on that was I used to work in a nonprofit world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13194)|
| 3:40:00| I did that for 11 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13200)|
| 3:40:01| And often there were events that might have a ticket price of, say, $100, $200 a ticket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13201)|
| 3:40:07| I'm thinking of some fancy dinners and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13207)|
| 3:40:10| So my question was help me understand on this if we've already got...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13210)|
| 3:40:17| If it's an event that might be, say, a $200 dinner that someone invites us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13217)|
| 3:40:23| when we've also got that $50 limit that's in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13223)|
| 3:40:28| are those reconcilable, or do you do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13228)|
| 3:40:31| and then also maybe have to send out a release that you're going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13231)|
| 3:40:35| So that was just something that I kind of wanted to get a little bit more information on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13235)|
| 3:40:40| It's my understanding it's not the ticket price, it's the value of goods received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13240)|
| 3:40:45| Usually those ticket prices include a donation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13245)|
| 3:40:49| Right. It's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13249)|
| 3:40:50| If you go to, say, usually if you go to a $200 dinner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13250)|
| 3:40:53| the value of the food is probably going to be $50, give or take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13253)|
| 3:40:57| and the rest of it is a donation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13257)|
| 3:41:00| But if there were events that were more, would you have to disclose that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13260)|
| 3:41:04| I guess that was just something I kind of wanted to get some clarification from this committee on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13264)|
| 3:41:09| before we move forward with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13269)|
| 3:41:11| Commissioner Skinnecker, do you want to respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13271)|
| 3:41:13| Yeah, if the food cost more than $50, you would have to repay the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13273)|
| 3:41:18| But most times you go to any kind of banquet because of the way that they're purchasing the food in volume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13278)|
| 3:41:25| There's no way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13285)|
| 3:41:26| I mean, it would have to be filet mignon, lobster, I mean, all kinds of stuff to get over $50 worth of food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13286)|
| 3:41:34| It's at the cost of the food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13294)|
| 3:41:36| Oh, I know, but I've done them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13296)|
| 3:41:37| Well, not the cost, it's actually the value that you receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13297)|
| 3:41:40| And, I mean, I've put on events where I had a $50 meal, but then I had entertainment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13300)|
| 3:41:44| that was probably arguably worth at least $25 or $50,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13304)|
| 3:41:47| so maybe it was a $250 ticket where you're getting $100 in value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13307)|
| 3:41:51| And when we would receipt a donation receipt, we let folks could only claim $150 as their deduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13311)|
| 3:41:58| So I guess that's something that we just would want to get clarification on, that you'd have to reimburse it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13318)|
| 3:42:04| But ultimately, it's not just about the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13324)|
| 3:42:06| It's just, you know, I guess we want to avoid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13326)|
| 3:42:09| And part of it, we all know, and guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13329)|
| 3:42:11| I've played the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13331)|
| 3:42:13| You know, always, if you're in the nonprofit, look at all the groups that do wonderful work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13333)|
| 3:42:18| But they all would love to get us to attend their events and all those sort of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13338)|
| 3:42:22| You're always going to invite folks to those sort of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13342)|
| 3:42:25| I just want to make sure that at least we've discussed and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13345)|
| 3:42:28| here's something that you need to be aware of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13348)|
| 3:42:30| you need to have to address to make sure that we don't find ourselves contradicting ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13350)|
| 3:42:34| If you say that, you know, we've got nonprofit events that we've pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13354)|
| 3:42:40| but we've also got that $50 in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13360)|
| 3:42:42| So it's just something we may want to clarify within this commission, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13362)|
| 3:42:48| how you'd handled it if someone were invited to an event that, you know, had a greater value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13368)|
| 3:42:54| I think you probably hit it right on the nose when you said, what does the IRS allow on the deduction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13374)|
| 3:43:02| Make a donation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13382)|
| 3:43:07| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13387)|
| 3:43:08| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13388)|
| 3:43:09| That's what I was going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13389)|
| 3:43:11| I've noticed in some of the invitations that I received lately, there's actually a phrase on the invitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13391)|
| 3:43:20| It says, the charitable deduction is so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13400)|
| 3:43:26| It's a $100 ticket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13406)|
| 3:43:28| I'll also point out, which this is kind of funny, we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13408)|
| 3:43:31| it's pretty rare that the expensive ones they're saying just come for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13411)|
| 3:43:34| They're all sending us invitations, but we're still being expected to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13414)|
| 3:43:38| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13418)|
| 3:43:39| The exception that I'm mentioning is a relatively rare thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13419)|
| 3:43:42| Usually I look at, I think John, when I first was elected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13422)|
| 3:43:46| John made a joke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13426)|
| 3:43:47| He said, well, you're going to need to get a new mailbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13427)|
| 3:43:50| Was that you, Randy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13430)|
| 3:43:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13431)|
| 3:43:52| Buy some Tony Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13432)|
| 3:43:53| Yeah, you're going to need a new mailbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13433)|
| 3:43:55| So that's true, but I guess my point is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13435)|
| 3:43:57| we just need to make sure that this continues to be top of mind for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13437)|
| 3:44:01| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13441)|
| 3:44:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13442)|
| 3:44:03| So just pay attention to the reputable fundraisers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13443)|
| 3:44:06| are going to tell you what part is charitable deduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13446)|
| 3:44:12| So that helps you determine what it is the actual expense is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13452)|
| 3:44:18| And if it exceeds $50, you need to give them the portion that exceeds $50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13458)|
| 3:44:27| Commissioner Buster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13467)|
| 3:44:29| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13469)|
| 3:44:32| I go to these things where they, like Yolk and some of these other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13472)|
| 3:44:36| where they have these tables and say, we'd like you to have dinner with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13476)|
| 3:44:39| But every time that I go there, I'm writing either a $250 check or a $500 check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13479)|
| 3:44:45| So they're not free, but then they send you a note and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13485)|
| 3:44:48| this is how much you get to declare on your income tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13488)|
| 3:44:53| So anytime there's a free event that you go to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13493)|
| 3:44:59| just put a minimum that you're going to pay, like $250 or $500,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13499)|
| 3:45:03| and then you don't have to worry about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13503)|
| 3:45:05| I'm going to invite Mr. Buster over to my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13505)|
| 3:45:09| To donate too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13509)|
| 3:45:11| He puts it on his expense account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13511)|
| 3:45:13| That can't be sunshine, can it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13513)|
| 3:45:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13515)|
| 3:45:16| Well, I think what Charlie was talking about with Yolk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13516)|
| 3:45:19| in most organizations, there's a Toma friendship dinner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13519)|
| 3:45:22| and we have one with the epilepsy and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13522)|
| 3:45:24| They ask people to get people there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13524)|
| 3:45:27| So there is no cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13527)|
| 3:45:29| But then they are expecting you to make a nice donation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13529)|
| 3:45:34| And there's a difference between a fancy dinner where you're charging a ticket| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13534)|
| 3:45:37| and a free event, which is more of a friend-raiser,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13537)|
| 3:45:39| where you're going to get a direct ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13539)|
| 3:45:41| So, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13541)|
| 3:45:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13544)|
| 3:45:45| Seeing no further discussion, we have a motion before us to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13545)|
| 3:45:50| That's been properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13550)|
| 3:45:51| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13551)|
| 3:45:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13552)|
| 3:45:53| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13553)|
| 3:45:54| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13554)|
| 3:45:55| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13555)|
| 3:45:56| Resolution 905 is approving an update to the Knox County Code of Ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13556)|
| 3:46:04| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13564)|
| 3:46:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13565)|
| 3:46:08| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13568)|
| 3:46:15| Seeing none, the motion before us is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13575)|
| 3:46:20| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13580)|
| 3:46:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13581)|
| 3:46:22| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13582)|
| 3:46:25| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13585)|
| 3:46:26| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13586)|
| 3:46:27| The next item is Resolution 906 that was added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13587)|
| 3:46:31| It's amending the charter of the Knox County Audit Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13591)|
| 3:46:34| to provide for the terms of the commissioners serving on the audit committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13594)|
| 3:46:37| to coincide with their respective terms of office on the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13597)|
| 3:46:41| and to exclude citizen members on the audit committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13601)|
| 3:46:44| from the term limit provision of the Knox County Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13604)|
| 3:46:51| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13611)|
| 3:46:52| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13612)|
| 3:46:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13613)|
| 3:46:55| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13615)|
| 3:46:56| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13616)|
| 3:46:57| Was this approved by the audit committee at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13617)|
| 3:46:59| or did it come out of audit committee or is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13619)|
| 3:47:02| No, this was actually an update through the law director's office on information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13622)|
| 3:47:07| to make it, I guess really to update the composition of the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13627)|
| 3:47:14| The chairman of the audit committee has reviewed it and approved it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13634)|
| 3:47:19| and the other citizen member of the audit committee is completing their four-year term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13639)|
| 3:47:25| and does not want to serve on the audit committee again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13645)|
| 3:47:34| Okay, I have Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13654)|
| 3:47:37| I wanted to ask about the term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13657)|
| 3:47:41| I was going to ask about that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13661)|
| 3:47:45| The first part of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13665)|
| 3:47:46| Knox County commissioners on the audit committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13666)|
| 3:47:48| serve terms that coincide with their respective terms of office on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13668)|
| 3:47:52| That means the amount of time that is left in their current serving term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13672)|
| 3:47:56| whether that is one year, two years, three years, or four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13676)|
| 3:48:00| which I agree with, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13680)|
| 3:48:02| I think that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13682)|
| 3:48:04| I do question the citizen's members shall not be subject to term limits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13684)|
| 3:48:09| provision of Knox County Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13689)|
| 3:48:12| That is something that we seem to follow with every other appointment we make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13692)|
| 3:48:16| whether it be BZA, MPC, the Development Court Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13696)|
| 3:48:25| Well, I think there's a specific requirement for that member to be a CPA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13705)|
| 3:48:31| a certified audit, or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13711)|
| 3:48:33| It eliminates a large majority of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13713)|
| 3:48:37| I think you make an effort to find somebody else through their publication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13717)|
| 3:48:42| but I think there's going to be a time where you can't find another CPA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13722)|
| 3:48:47| or auditor to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13727)|
| 3:48:48| I think that's the requirement of that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13728)|
| 3:48:51| Okay, so you're saying the requirement of the position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13731)|
| 3:48:54| in the limited narrow field should outweigh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13734)|
| 3:48:58| I think you should make an effort after two terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13738)|
| 3:49:00| and if you can't find anybody after two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13740)|
| 3:49:03| if nobody else wants to fill it and they choose to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13743)|
| 3:49:06| you can give them another term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13746)|
| 3:49:08| But we've done that before on other boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13748)|
| 3:49:11| where you couldn't find a qualified person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13751)|
| 3:49:14| There's a history in that somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13754)|
| 3:49:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13756)|
| 3:49:21| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13761)|
| 3:49:22| So if the language needs to be that we not have just a blanket, no term limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13762)|
| 3:49:30| we're looking at this on a yearly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13770)|
| 3:49:33| No, these are not yearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13773)|
| 3:49:35| This is not a standing committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13775)|
| 3:49:36| Okay, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13776)|
| 3:49:38| Yes, I indicated the wrong number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13778)|
| 3:49:43| But my question is when we deal with such a narrow field of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13783)|
| 3:49:49| do we need to redefine the narrow field of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13789)|
| 3:49:54| to have people just with the experience in business and not just in auditing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13794)|
| 3:50:00| Because I'm concerned that you will deal with people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13800)|
| 3:50:03| one or two people over a longer term of time that will impact the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13803)|
| 3:50:12| versus having more than one person with broader experience at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13812)|
| 3:50:20| I think the qualifications to be a citizen appointed to this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13820)|
| 3:50:24| are spelled out in the charter of the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13824)|
| 3:50:28| They have to be approved by the knowledge board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13828)|
| 3:50:34| I want to make sure and clear, and I don't know if we need to add language to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13834)|
| 3:50:40| but this will take effect September 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13840)|
| 3:50:44| We have five openings on audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13844)|
| 3:50:46| and I think it's only right that we start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13846)|
| 3:50:50| If we're going to start a new process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13850)|
| 3:50:52| we do it at the time that we have all those openings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13852)|
| 3:50:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13855)|
| 3:50:57| Do we need to add language to that, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13857)|
| 3:51:01| It's the policy decision of this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13861)|
| 3:51:03| However you want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13863)|
| 3:51:05| I think Commissioner Anders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13865)|
| 3:51:08| we have run into situations on this particular body where we can't get anybody to serve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13868)|
| 3:51:14| and even the referring group can't even get anybody to refer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13874)|
| 3:51:19| And the way it's defined in the charter of this organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13879)|
| 3:51:23| that leaves you with nowhere to go if we don't reappoint CPA Brad Anders who is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13883)|
| 3:51:29| You see what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13889)|
| 3:51:30| I've never been accused of being good at math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13890)|
| 3:51:33| But you got the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13893)|
| 3:51:35| I think if you added a sentence there that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13895)|
| 3:51:38| after two terms, the position is reappointed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13898)|
| 3:51:42| and if no qualified person comes forward, then that person can serve another term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13902)|
| 3:51:48| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13908)|
| 3:51:51| I was just going to say that the citizen members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13911)|
| 3:51:54| I admire them for giving up their time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13914)|
| 3:51:57| because it is a lot of effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13917)|
| 3:52:00| and particularly the effort of the chairman of the audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13920)|
| 3:52:03| and that if they want to serve more than four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13923)|
| 3:52:07| I think that's great because just the continuing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13927)|
| 3:52:13| all of that knowledge continuing on for another four years or even more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13933)|
| 3:52:17| if they even wanted to serve another four years after that, is terrific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13937)|
| 3:52:22| But are you okay with the language that Commissioner Anders added?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13942)|
| 3:52:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13945)|
| 3:52:26| I think could you just say that the citizen members should serve two four-year terms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13946)|
| 3:52:35| Could serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13955)|
| 3:52:36| Could serve two four-year terms, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13956)|
| 3:52:39| But Brad's speaking if we can't find, and I thought you were too, if we can't find somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13959)|
| 3:52:43| Yeah, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13963)|
| 3:52:44| I was just trying to make it simpler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13964)|
| 3:52:46| So what's a term for them? Is it four years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13966)|
| 3:52:48| Four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13968)|
| 3:52:51| So is there a term limit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13971)|
| 3:52:54| See, they can serve right now basically four years, but they may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13974)|
| 3:53:01| They may want to bail out after two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13981)|
| 3:53:03| and that's why the law director was saying it's hard to find individuals to fill this position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13983)|
| 3:53:09| which is very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13989)|
| 3:53:10| I would say they can serve two terms, and it's reposted after two terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13990)|
| 3:53:14| so qualified applicants can do one more term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13994)|
| 3:53:19| Two four-year terms, and it's reposted, re-advertised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=13999)|
| 3:53:22| Right, they've got to be re-elected after four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14002)|
| 3:53:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14005)|
| 3:53:26| So however we want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14006)|
| 3:53:30| Are you taking notes here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14010)|
| 3:53:34| What's the preferred time that you want? I mean four or eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14014)|
| 3:53:38| What I'm saying is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14018)|
| 3:53:39| Because everybody else has two terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14019)|
| 3:53:41| I think what everybody's trying to say is two four-year terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14021)|
| 3:53:44| and then if you post the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14024)|
| 3:53:46| And no qualified applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14026)|
| 3:53:48| No qualified applicants apply, that you can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14028)|
| 3:53:51| One more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14031)|
| 3:53:52| Do you want to limit to just one more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14032)|
| 3:53:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14033)|
| 3:53:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14034)|
| 3:53:55| Twelve years, I mean they'll be tired of it by that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14035)|
| 3:53:57| I think they would be very.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14037)|
| 3:53:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14039)|
| 3:54:00| Did you get that language, Bud?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14040)|
| 3:54:04| Do you want to repeat that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14044)|
| 3:54:12| Did you get it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14052)|
| 3:54:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14053)|
| 3:54:14| So we can add that to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14054)|
| 3:54:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14056)|
| 3:54:17| So we can amend the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14057)|
| 3:54:19| A friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14059)|
| 3:54:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14060)|
| 3:54:21| I would like to make a friendly amendment that we adopt the language from Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14061)|
| 3:54:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14068)|
| 3:54:29| That Drew has in record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14069)|
| 3:54:31| I'm going to restate it in the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14071)|
| 3:54:33| Citizens can serve two four-year terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14073)|
| 3:54:36| The ad position is re-advertised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14076)|
| 3:54:38| and if no one qualified comes forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14078)|
| 3:54:40| that citizen can serve one more term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14080)|
| 3:54:44| Worded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14084)|
| 3:54:45| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14085)|
| 3:54:49| Who was the second on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14089)|
| 3:54:53| Would he agree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14093)|
| 3:54:54| I mean, were you the first, second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14094)|
| 3:54:55| I was the second, and I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14095)|
| 3:54:59| I can't tell if that's Thomas or Brentley down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14099)|
| 3:55:05| It's me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14105)|
| 3:55:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14106)|
| 3:55:09| And I feel like you've already taken care of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14109)|
| 3:55:11| but just before we close the door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14111)|
| 3:55:15| and I see the reason for continuity on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14115)|
| 3:55:18| but I'm wondering if the reason that not so many people come forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14118)|
| 3:55:22| is because four years scares the crap out of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14122)|
| 3:55:25| And I go back to what Commissioner Gill said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14125)|
| 3:55:29| Maybe you can't get people to get interested in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14129)|
| 3:55:33| because it is such a long term and such a commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14133)|
| 3:55:36| Would it be better to have somebody that could serve up to four two-year terms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14136)|
| 3:55:44| It just seems like if somebody served a two-year term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14144)|
| 3:55:46| they might be more likely to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14146)|
| 3:55:49| if your problem for not getting enough is because it's four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14149)|
| 3:55:55| Well, they are free to resign at any time if they get on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14155)|
| 3:55:59| Yeah, but nobody likes to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14159)|
| 3:56:01| I see what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14161)|
| 3:56:02| Nobody wants to make a four-year commitment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14162)|
| 3:56:04| and if you had a two-year commitment and you liked it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14164)|
| 3:56:06| you would gladly seek it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14166)|
| 3:56:08| But it might lead to a lot more turnover with people that get on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14168)|
| 3:56:11| and decide two years isn't enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14171)|
| 3:56:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14175)|
| 3:56:19| What do you think, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14179)|
| 3:56:20| Mr. Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14180)|
| 3:56:22| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14182)|
| 3:56:24| I've been looking at the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14184)|
| 3:56:26| and the charter says we can develop these committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14186)|
| 3:56:30| or whatever we want to call them here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14190)|
| 3:56:33| like the audit committee or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14193)|
| 3:56:37| But it says in there, since we've got term limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14197)|
| 3:56:40| that they shall be limited to a four-year term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14200)|
| 3:56:46| or two four-year terms in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14206)|
| 3:56:50| That goes for not just the audit committees but for everybody else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14210)|
| 3:56:54| and the way it says in the charter that that applies to every office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14214)|
| 3:56:58| Is that not correct, what the charter says about the two four-year terms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14218)|
| 3:57:04| That's for elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14224)|
| 3:57:06| No, but it says in there in the committees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14226)|
| 3:57:08| like if you're appointed to the, say, MPC, four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14228)|
| 3:57:15| you get two four-year terms, and then you go off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14235)|
| 3:57:19| Is that not in that charter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14239)|
| 3:57:21| I thought I saw in the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14241)|
| 3:57:23| and I wish I had brought my charter with me that said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14243)|
| 3:57:26| that these committees are set up for four-year terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14246)|
| 3:57:29| and up to two years because of our term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14249)|
| 3:57:34| This is not for the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14254)|
| 3:57:38| The commission voted, I can't remember if it was by resolution or ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14258)|
| 3:57:42| that each committee would be limited to their term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14262)|
| 3:57:49| Like I said, it appears to be that that's in the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14269)|
| 3:57:53| and if we're going to make that amendment like what Brad said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14273)|
| 3:57:57| or our schoolmaker has said right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14277)|
| 3:57:59| it looks like you're going to have to amend that one section in the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14279)|
| 3:58:02| to exclude private citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14282)|
| 3:58:04| Is that what we're doing here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14284)|
| 3:58:06| I think that's in commission rules and not the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14286)|
| 3:58:10| and it came from Paul Pinkston, and then there's been a couple of boards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14290)|
| 3:58:16| and I think it was the Ethics Committee or the—I think it was actually the Audit Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14296)|
| 3:58:20| where we had talked about more than two terms because of the uniqueness of that appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14300)|
| 3:58:25| So this is not uncharted territory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14305)|
| 3:58:28| I don't think we'll ever use that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14308)|
| 3:58:30| because we have a hard time keeping anybody more than four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14310)|
| 3:58:33| but I think that with the qualifications of that position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14313)|
| 3:58:36| I think it bodes for us to have an opportunity for somebody that's qualified to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14316)|
| 3:58:41| But on this one, we're just talking about the Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14321)|
| 3:58:45| To change that to citizens shall not be subject to that term limit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14325)|
| 3:58:48| so if we want to reappoint them, we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14328)|
| 3:58:51| but you're saying you're going to limit it now to two and then possibly another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14331)|
| 3:58:58| And this would take care of that, wouldn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14338)|
| 3:59:00| Do we have to be that specific in taking—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14340)|
| 3:59:02| Yeah, because then it could be a perpetual—I mean, in theory, it could be a perpetual appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14342)|
| 3:59:06| But they have to be reappointed every four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14346)|
| 3:59:09| Perpetually, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14349)|
| 3:59:10| Yeah, this body would decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14350)|
| 3:59:11| It would decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14351)|
| 3:59:12| Brad's amendment would take the place that citizens members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14352)|
| 3:59:15| shall not be subject to term limit provision in Knox County Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14355)|
| 3:59:20| I mean, I don't do a chore to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14360)|
| 3:59:21| I just think it's—we've dealt with this before on this particular body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14361)|
| 3:59:25| and it's hard to find qualified people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14365)|
| 3:59:27| I think when I was the chairman, we couldn't find anybody to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14367)|
| 3:59:31| We had the chairman, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14371)|
| 3:59:33| We kept on extra, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14373)|
| 3:59:36| Yes, we actually posted him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14376)|
| 3:59:38| He stayed two years extra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14378)|
| 3:59:39| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14379)|
| 3:59:42| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14382)|
| 3:59:43| Then he left us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14383)|
| 3:59:45| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14385)|
| 3:59:46| I was going to make comment to the fact that we have to remember way back when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14386)|
| 3:59:52| on the Board of Zoning Appeals, when it was made up of commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14392)|
| 3:59:57| that one commissioner was not reelected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14397)|
| 4:00:02| and wanted to serve his additional two more years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14402)|
| 4:00:06| as a member of the Board of Zoning Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14406)|
| 4:00:08| and he's not an elected commissioner of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14408)|
| 4:00:11| So I think some of this language that we should make sure we guard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14411)|
| 4:00:18| as in saying two terms, and if not filled by a different person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14418)|
| 4:00:26| one more term is the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14426)|
| 4:00:29| We're trying to guard against going in the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14429)|
| 4:00:34| It's funny you mention that because I was looking at our additional boards and committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14434)|
| 4:00:38| and Commissioner Thomas is on the Arena Use Committee until December of 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14438)|
| 4:00:45| That's supposed to be a secret.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14445)|
| 4:00:55| Okay, is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14455)|
| 4:00:59| I'm going to try to restate this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14459)|
| 4:01:02| The motion before us is to adopt this language in the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14462)|
| 4:01:07| minus the line that says citizens shall not be subject to the term limits provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14467)|
| 4:01:12| and substituting in that citizen members shall be able to serve two four-year terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14472)|
| 4:01:20| and if the position is posted and no qualified applicants are received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14480)|
| 4:01:25| may be appointed for one additional four-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14485)|
| 4:01:33| Does that mean that the one person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14493)|
| 4:01:38| new person applies if they have to get it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14498)|
| 4:01:42| You have to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14502)|
| 4:01:45| Well, yeah, but if you've got to qualify that, but you can't not approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14505)|
| 4:01:50| And we don't, I mean, the Tennessee Society of CPAs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14510)|
| 4:01:58| The Tennessee Society of CPAs makes that determination of who the qualified candidate is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14518)|
| 4:02:03| so it makes it easier for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14523)|
| 4:02:06| Didn't we used to have two professional bodies that used to recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14526)|

| 4:02:13| Mr. Chair, there's a yellow book and a blue book,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14533)|
| 4:02:18| and the yellow book was one professional organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14538)|

| 4:02:25| and we're a government organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14545)|
| 4:02:27| so it was determined that both people on the audit committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14547)|
| 4:02:32| should come from the government book,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14552)|
| 4:02:36| whichever one's blue and yellow or whatever they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180827?start=14556)|
