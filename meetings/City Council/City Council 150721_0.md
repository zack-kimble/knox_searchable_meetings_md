| 0:08:44| Let me just say on behalf of these people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=524)|
| 0:08:46| they've asked me to say a few words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=526)|
| 0:08:50| And what Vice Mayor Pavlis just read is exactly what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=530)|
| 0:08:57| I've got the notes in my pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=537)|
| 0:09:00| So I must have written that for you, Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=540)|
| 0:09:03| Really, what we're here for is to honor and thank Miss Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=543)|
| 0:09:10| See, I have to call her Miss Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=550)|
| 0:09:15| I've got to get serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=555)|
| 0:09:18| For the job well done, the service to this city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=558)|
| 0:09:23| and to the council people that she's worked with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=563)|
| 0:09:28| You did an outstanding job, Cindy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=568)|
| 0:09:30| We really appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=570)|

| 0:09:36| And one other thing they asked me to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=576)|
| 0:09:39| don't forget to call on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=579)|

| 0:09:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=583)|
| 0:09:50| So we also received this email earlier today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=590)|
| 0:09:53| from former Councilman Joe Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=593)|
| 0:09:55| And he asked that we read it and to the record here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=595)|
| 0:09:58| So it says, I can remember years ago when my father, Ed Bailey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=598)|
| 0:10:02| was a council member, how much he enjoyed and appreciated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=602)|
| 0:10:05| the city council staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=605)|
| 0:10:07| It seemed like there were these magical, beautiful women who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=607)|
| 0:10:10| knew how to do everything right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=610)|
| 0:10:13| I found later it was true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=613)|
| 0:10:15| Under the leadership of Cindy Mitchell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=615)|
| 0:10:16| there is not a finer group of professional people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=616)|
| 0:10:19| in any city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=619)|
| 0:10:20| Besides being at the top of their job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=620)|
| 0:10:23| they are caring, quality people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=623)|
| 0:10:25| carry themselves with class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=625)|
| 0:10:27| I was honored to work with Cindy, Melissa, and Susan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=627)|
| 0:10:30| And my dad was right in his description.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=630)|
| 0:10:33| As we say goodbye to Cindy tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=633)|
| 0:10:35| there will be some big shoes to fill in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=635)|
| 0:10:38| Nobody truly knows how big a job they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=638)|
| 0:10:40| and how much they really do for the council and the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=640)|

| 0:11:09| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=669)|
| 0:11:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=670)|
| 0:11:11| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=671)|
| 0:11:12| That passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=672)|
| 0:11:15| Good start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=675)|
| 0:11:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=675)|
| 0:11:16| So now I also have a proclamation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=676)|
| 0:11:20| on behalf of the people of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=680)|
| 0:11:23| I here honor the mayor, Madeline Rojero,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=683)|
| 0:11:25| to publicly recognize Cindy Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=685)|
| 0:11:29| Whereas Cindy Mitchell came to work for the city recorder's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=689)|
| 0:11:31| office on December 26, 1979, as assistant city recorder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=691)|
| 0:11:36| and assumed the title of city recorder on July 7, 1981.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=696)|
| 0:11:41| And whereas her more than 35 years of service in that office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=701)|
| 0:11:44| have been marked by unfailing professionalism, courtesy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=704)|
| 0:11:48| reliability, cheerfulness, and an almost superhuman level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=708)|
| 0:11:53| of patience in her dealings with elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=713)|
| 0:11:56| and the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=716)|
| 0:11:57| And whereas through the terms of six mayors and dozens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=717)|
| 0:12:00| of city council members, Cindy has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=720)|
| 0:12:03| been a stalwart and steadfast keeper of motions, seconds, votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=723)|
| 0:12:07| agendas, and resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=727)|
| 0:12:09| And whereas her ability to articulate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=729)|
| 0:12:12| rambling, complex, labyrinthine captions for ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=732)|
| 0:12:17| and resolutions with grace, speed, and clarity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=737)|
| 0:12:21| has no doubt reduced the cumulative length of city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=741)|
| 0:12:23| council meetings by hundreds of hours over the past dozen years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=743)|
| 0:12:27| thereby allowing city officials and staff members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=747)|
| 0:12:30| to spend more precious time with their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=750)|
| 0:12:33| And whereas the people of the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=753)|
| 0:12:35| have benefited tremendously from Cindy's dedicated service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=755)|
| 0:12:38| and wish all the best to her and her family in the years ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=758)|
| 0:12:41| Now, therefore, I, Madeline Rojero,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=761)|
| 0:12:43| mayor of the city of Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=763)|
| 0:12:45| do hereby publicly recognize on July 21, 2015,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=765)|
| 0:12:50| Cindy Mitchell for her many contributions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=770)|
| 0:12:53| and ask all citizens to join in this observance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=773)|
| 0:12:56| And I want to say that I have appreciated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=776)|
| 0:12:58| so much working with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=778)|
| 0:13:00| You made it easy to assume this position some three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=780)|
| 0:13:03| and a half years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=783)|
| 0:13:05| And though we look forward to working with Will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=785)|
| 0:13:08| we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=788)|
| 0:13:08| He will never be a Cindy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=788)|
| 0:13:10| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=790)|
| 0:13:10| You're just not Cindy, Will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=790)|
| 0:13:12| But you can grow into our love as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=792)|
| 0:13:15| And I'm sure we'll learn to depend on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=795)|
| 0:13:17| But no, it's been wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=797)|
| 0:13:19| And I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=799)|
| 0:13:20| And I hope you will enjoy your retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=800)|
| 0:13:23| You have certainly earned it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=803)|
| 0:13:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=806)|
| 0:13:37| Well, when I hear all of these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=817)|
| 0:13:39| I think this really isn't me they're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=819)|
| 0:13:43| Number one, I'm not that old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=823)|
| 0:13:45| I certainly would never have come to work anywhere in 1979.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=825)|
| 0:13:49| But I just have nothing but thanks to say to all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=829)|
| 0:13:56| Every council member I've ever worked for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=836)|
| 0:13:59| every mayor I've worked with, directors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=839)|
| 0:14:02| former council members, employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=842)|
| 0:14:06| And I want to say that the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=846)|
| 0:14:10| is a great place to work, to live, to play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=850)|
| 0:14:14| And it's certainly been good to me, to my family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=854)|
| 0:14:18| And I just have lots of thank yous to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=858)|
| 0:14:25| But I just hope you'll keep in touch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=865)|
| 0:14:28| And I love all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=868)|
| 0:14:30| And thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=870)|
| 0:14:39| We'd like to recognize our family who's here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=879)|
| 0:14:41| So Richard, and Caroline, and Chad, would you stand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=881)|
| 0:14:44| so we can thank you for sharing Cindy with us all these years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=884)|
| 0:14:53| My mom and dad are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| Mom and dad, stand up too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=895)|
| 0:14:56| Daddy and daddy, they're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=896)|
| 0:14:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=898)|
| 0:15:09| Now you just have to calmly read the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=909)|
| 0:15:12| Now, where were we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=912)|
| 0:15:13| Consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=913)|
| 0:15:14| Madam Mayor, if we could, we'd like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=914)|
| 0:15:17| to get a picture of past council members and current.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=917)|
| 0:15:23| Do everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=923)|
| 0:15:25| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=925)|
| 0:15:25| If you all would just give us a minute here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=925)|
| 0:15:27| This is a picture for posterity here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=927)|
| 0:15:42| Former council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=942)|
| 0:16:54| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1014)|
| 0:16:59| Hi, Karen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1019)|
| 0:17:00| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1022)|
| 0:17:16| I'm going to be wearing my nice outfit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1036)|
| 0:17:25| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1045)|
| 0:17:26| Thank you, Jack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1046)|
| 0:17:50| We can move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1070)|
| 0:17:51| So now we're on the consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1071)|
| 0:17:53| Is there a motion to approve the consent items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1073)|
| 0:17:56| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1076)|
| 0:17:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1077)|
| 0:17:58| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1078)|
| 0:17:59| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1079)|
| 0:18:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1080)|
| 0:18:00| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1080)|
| 0:18:02| Those are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1082)|
| 0:18:03| For the mayor's report, first, I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| to say a few words about the terrible shootings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1086)|
| 0:18:08| in Chattanooga last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1088)|
| 0:18:11| Obviously, it was a tragedy that greatly impacted Chattanooga,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1091)|
| 0:18:15| but it happens to all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1095)|
| 0:18:16| It impacts all of us when we see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1096)|
| 0:18:19| It did happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1099)|
| 0:18:20| I did send a message to Mayor Andy Burke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1100)|
| 0:18:24| We communicated last week, and he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1104)|
| 0:18:27| knows that we're all thinking of him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1107)|
| 0:18:30| and keeping him in the city and our prayers and our thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1110)|
| 0:18:34| And we also, it was really quite significant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1114)|
| 0:18:40| on Sunday evening, the Muslim community of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1120)|
| 0:18:43| actually, and some others of the churches and organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1123)|
| 0:18:47| came together for a prayer service for Chattanooga| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1127)|
| 0:18:50| on Crouch Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1130)|
| 0:18:51| And that was a really moving experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1131)|
| 0:18:54| for those who were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1134)|
| 0:18:56| So we just want to let Chattanooga know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1136)|
| 0:18:59| that we continue to keep them in our thoughts and prayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1139)|
| 0:19:02| And our heart goes out to them and to the families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| who lost loved ones in that terrible attack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1144)|
| 0:19:08| So let's continue to remember them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1148)|
| 0:19:12| Also, I want to acknowledge another loss in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1152)|
| 0:19:16| Last week, unexpectedly, Ann Woodall passed away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1156)|
| 0:19:20| Many of you know Ann.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1160)|
| 0:19:21| She was a former school board member and a longtime advocate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1161)|
| 0:19:25| for children as a director of the East Tennessee Children's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1165)|
| 0:19:29| Hospital Rehab Center and a number of other organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1169)|
| 0:19:32| that she was involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1172)|
| 0:19:34| She was also a dear friend of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1174)|
| 0:19:35| Many people know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1175)|
| 0:19:37| And we are all very sad that she left us so unexpectedly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1177)|
| 0:19:41| So our heart goes out to her son Jason and his fiance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1181)|
| 0:19:44| Tressie, and all of her many, many friends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1184)|
| 0:19:46| who have been impacted by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1186)|
| 0:19:49| There will be a celebration of life later in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1189)|
| 0:19:55| It's being planned probably around her birthday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1195)|
| 0:19:57| towards the end of August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1197)|
| 0:19:58| And that will be publicly announced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1198)|
| 0:20:00| when that is scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1200)|
| 0:20:02| I do want to tell you about two meetings that are coming up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| this Thursday, July 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1205)|
| 0:20:08| At 5.30 PM that day, there will be a public meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1208)|
| 0:20:11| at Dogwood Elementary on the redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1211)|
| 0:20:14| of the Old South High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1214)|
| 0:20:16| This is the building we acquired last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1216)|
| 0:20:19| through condemnation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1219)|
| 0:20:20| And we are planning to issue a request for proposals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1220)|
| 0:20:23| for its redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1223)|
| 0:20:25| The meeting will give the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1225)|
| 0:20:26| a chance to have input into that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1226)|
| 0:20:29| And that's, again, 5.30 PM this Thursday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1229)|
| 0:20:33| at Dogwood Elementary, which is 705 Tipton Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1233)|
| 0:20:39| And actually, at 5 PM that same day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1239)|
| 0:20:42| there will be a public hearing at KCDC's offices on Broadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1242)|
| 0:20:46| on the tax increment financing application for buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1246)|
| 0:20:50| at 120 and 122 South Central Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1250)|
| 0:20:53| That's the former site of Big Don, the costumier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1253)|
| 0:20:57| The cost, how do you say that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1257)|
| 0:20:59| Costumier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1259)|
| 0:21:00| Costume shop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1260)|
| 0:21:01| The costume, Big Don's costume shop, OK?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1261)|
| 0:21:07| Keep these words simple, Jesse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1267)|
| 0:21:11| Everybody knows Big Don's in the old city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1271)|
| 0:21:16| As you all know, this is a proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1276)|
| 0:21:18| to redevelop the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1278)|
| 0:21:19| And this hearing at KCDC is the first step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| toward approving a TIF package for the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1282)|
| 0:21:25| So if you're interested in learning more about what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1285)|
| 0:21:27| the developer has in mind for this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1287)|
| 0:21:30| and want to know more about the TIF application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1290)|
| 0:21:33| please come to the hearing at 5 PM this Thursday at KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1293)|
| 0:21:37| And that's at 901 Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1297)|
| 0:21:41| That's the end of my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| Does council have anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1303)|
| 0:21:47| Councilman Campin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1307)|
| 0:21:48| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1308)|
| 0:21:49| I wanted to invite everyone out to the fabulous 5th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1309)|
| 0:21:52| for the Lonsdale Homecoming event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1312)|
| 0:21:54| It's not this weekend, but next Friday, July 31st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1314)|
| 0:21:58| through August 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1318)|
| 0:22:00| There'll be a parade Saturday, I believe, here at Grand Marshall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1320)|
| 0:22:03| And all the council is invited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1323)|
| 0:22:05| And everyone is invited to come out to the food and music| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1325)|
| 0:22:08| and Sammy Hill School, where it'll be going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1328)|
| 0:22:11| So come on out and celebrate Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1331)|
| 0:22:15| Come out in Grand Marshall with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1337)|
| 0:22:20| 8A is a resolution expressing support for the mayor's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1340)|
| 0:22:24| appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1344)|
| 0:22:25| We have another, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1345)|
| 0:22:25| We have another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1347)|
| 0:22:28| Yes, I'd like to suspend the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1348)|
| 0:22:29| and ask that we move 9B to the end of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1349)|
| 0:22:35| OK, 9B is the sign regulation ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1355)|
| 0:22:39| So as we did it last time, so we can get the rest of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1359)|
| 0:22:41| out of the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1361)|
| 0:22:42| So is there any, let's see, so that was a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1362)|
| 0:22:45| to move it to the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1365)|
| 0:22:46| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1366)|
| 0:22:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1367)|
| 0:22:48| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| Well, I guess, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1370)|
| 0:22:53| You know, I think the people that have come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1373)|
| 0:22:55| a lot of the people that are here this meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1375)|
| 0:22:57| want to hear this read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1377)|
| 0:22:59| And they've come to a long workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1379)|
| 0:23:02| They were here for a long meeting on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1382)|
| 0:23:05| So I sort of don't see the reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1385)|
| 0:23:07| to push it to the end of the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1387)|
| 0:23:09| and make them wait any longer than all the hours they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1389)|
| 0:23:12| already put into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1392)|
| 0:23:13| So I'll be voting against the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1393)|
| 0:23:17| to move it to the end of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1397)|
| 0:23:21| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1401)|
| 0:23:23| I don't think the purpose is to inconvenience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1403)|
| 0:23:25| those who are waiting for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| But for those who are not here for that item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1407)|
| 0:23:33| and for staff who are not here for that item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| it allows people to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1415)|
| 0:23:38| So we can give it the attention that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| Anyway, that's either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1420)|
| 0:23:41| Anyway you all want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1421)|
| 0:23:42| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1422)|
| 0:23:44| You ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1424)|
| 0:23:46| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1426)|
| 0:23:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1427)|
| 0:23:48| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1428)|
| 0:23:48| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1428)|
| 0:23:50| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1430)|
| 0:23:51| That motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1431)|
| 0:23:52| It will be moved to the end of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1432)|
| 0:23:53| And we will go as quickly as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1433)|
| 0:23:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1435)|
| 0:23:57| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| Thank you, Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1440)|

| 0:24:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1462)|
| 0:24:23| Our members, are these folks here in the audience?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1463)|
| 0:24:26| Anybody that's here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1466)|
| 0:24:27| Why don't you all stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1467)|
| 0:24:31| And we want to thank you so much for being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1471)|
| 0:24:32| willing to serve on our Business Advisory Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1472)|

| 0:24:53| 9A is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code Appendix| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1493)|

| 0:25:01| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1501)|
| 0:25:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1503)|
| 0:25:04| And we have two folks who are here to speak for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1504)|
| 0:25:10| Charlotte Tolley and James Bossie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1510)|
| 0:25:15| We'll go ahead and hear from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1515)|
| 0:25:21| Charlotte, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1521)|
| 0:25:24| And as you know, you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1524)|
| 0:25:25| And we appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1527)|
| 0:25:27| I'm Charlotte Tolley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| I live at 112 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1528)|
| 0:25:32| And I'm the founding manager of the Market Square Farmers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1532)|
| 0:25:34| Market and executive director of Nourish Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1534)|
| 0:25:37| And I'd like to express my full support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1537)|
| 0:25:38| for the recommendations laid out by the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1538)|
| 0:25:41| to enhance the city's urban food system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| I've spent the last 12 years working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| to improve our local food system, work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1545)|
| 0:25:47| that has led to the creation of Nourish Knoxville in 2013,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1547)|
| 0:25:50| a nonprofit organization dedicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1550)|
| 0:25:52| to cultivating and supporting relationships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1552)|
| 0:25:54| between farmers, artisanal producers, and the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1554)|
| 0:25:57| I've seen Knoxville's local food supply and demand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1557)|
| 0:25:59| grow over the past decade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1559)|
| 0:26:01| And I've had the privilege to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1561)|
| 0:26:02| to build relationships with the people that supply our food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1562)|
| 0:26:05| and learn their challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1565)|
| 0:26:06| When our market opened in 2004, we had about 10 total vendors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1566)|
| 0:26:10| And now we have more than 140 with a waiting list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1570)|
| 0:26:12| And the number of farmers markets in our region| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| has doubled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1574)|
| 0:26:15| We're also seeing more restaurants and groceries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1575)|
| 0:26:17| seeking to incorporate more local food in their menus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1577)|
| 0:26:21| and on their shelves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1581)|
| 0:26:23| However, only about 15 of our market's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1583)|
| 0:26:26| 65 agricultural producers are in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| a small percentage of the whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1589)|
| 0:26:31| And only one is within Knoxville city limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1591)|
| 0:26:33| which is a greenhouse producing mostly ornamental plants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1593)|
| 0:26:36| While there is, of course, a shortage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1596)|
| 0:26:38| of traditional farmland in cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1598)|
| 0:26:39| we know that a large amount of food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1599)|
| 0:26:40| can be grown in small spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1600)|
| 0:26:41| And there's still a lot of land in our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| that is underutilized or vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| Efforts like Abbey Fields, where vacant city land is turned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1605)|
| 0:26:48| into gardens and active space, can not only produce food,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1608)|
| 0:26:51| but encourage community building and active lifestyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1611)|
| 0:26:54| A healthy local food system is one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1614)|
| 0:26:56| that provides a relatively secure and locally controlled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1616)|

| 0:27:01| Healthy local food systems can improve economic opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1621)|
| 0:27:04| and provide more healthy food to more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1624)|
| 0:27:07| We are seeing a new generation of farmers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1627)|
| 0:27:08| without access to traditional family farmland that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1628)|
| 0:27:11| are looking for workable land near where their communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1631)|
| 0:27:13| and markets are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1633)|
| 0:27:14| For example, our offices at the Botanical Gardens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| in East Knoxville, where one of our market vendors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1637)|
| 0:27:20| is starting to grow herbal teas, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1640)|
| 0:27:23| she's currently selling a market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1643)|
| 0:27:25| but is producing a locally grown line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1645)|
| 0:27:27| And we can see firsthand how our business is growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| We see her work as innovative and inspiring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| and want to help decrease barriers for her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| and others in the future looking to grow food where they live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1654)|
| 0:27:37| For the last couple of years, the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1657)|
| 0:27:39| has been active in crafting changes to zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1659)|
| 0:27:42| and permitted uses of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1662)|
| 0:27:43| They have consulted with other cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| where urban ag has been successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1665)|
| 0:27:46| And they have worked with the Food Policy Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| to assure that the recommendations are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1668)|
| 0:27:50| agreeable to those working towards creating sustainable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1670)|
| 0:27:52| food systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1672)|
| 0:27:53| Urban agriculture has been a tool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1673)|
| 0:27:55| used in other cities to build safe, healthy, and more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1675)|
| 0:27:57| sustainable environments across the nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1677)|
| 0:27:59| These recommendations will enable Knoxville citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1679)|
| 0:28:02| to better access healthy, locally grown foods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| by clarifying ambiguous zoning language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| and by allowing entrepreneurial opportunities in food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1687)|
| 0:28:10| production through innovative land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1690)|
| 0:28:11| As someone who's worked closely with direct marketing farmers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1691)|
| 0:28:14| and food producers of all kinds, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| can say that this legislation is one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| that is much needed to support a healthy, livable city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1698)|
| 0:28:20| I urge you to support the recommendations laid out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1700)|
| 0:28:23| by the city of Knoxville and to work to make them a reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1703)|
| 0:28:26| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1706)|

| 0:28:44| for Cisco Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1724)|

| 0:28:48| Policy Council as an appointee by Mayor O'Hara| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1728)|
| 0:28:51| for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1731)|
| 0:28:52| Sorry, I mispronounced your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| That's OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1734)|
| 0:28:56| We're a volunteer board appointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1736)|
| 0:28:57| by the city and county mayors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1737)|
| 0:28:59| Our job is to advise city council and county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| on all items dealing with food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1742)|
| 0:29:05| We've had many successes over the last few years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| and worked tirelessly with many groups on all issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| that deal with food in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| I had the pleasure to serve as chair of the council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1752)|
| 0:29:15| for 2013 and 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1755)|
| 0:29:18| Two years ago, I had the privilege| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| to attend the Institute for Sustainable Communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| It's a national conference with members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1763)|
| 0:29:25| from offices of sustainability, food policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1765)|
| 0:29:28| councils, and other institutions that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1768)|
| 0:29:31| deal with these kind of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1771)|
| 0:29:34| When you come to that conference from Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| you're treated like a rock star.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1776)|
| 0:29:38| You guys might not know is that in the early 80s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1778)|
| 0:29:41| Knoxville had the foresight to start the first food policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1783)|
| 0:29:44| So now there are hundreds throughout the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1784)|
| 0:29:47| We get calls all the time on how we're still growing and doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1787)|
| 0:29:51| the things that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1791)|
| 0:29:54| Our contingency was represented by the Food Policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1794)|
| 0:29:56| Council, the Metropolitan Planning Commission, the City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1796)|
| 0:29:59| Law Department, and the Office of Sustainability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1799)|
| 0:30:03| The team was able to start to work on this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| with advice from communities throughout the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1806)|
| 0:30:09| The first part that was put in were some of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1809)|
| 0:30:12| gardens that you might have seen in our community schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1812)|
| 0:30:15| Pond Gap being the most successful that has started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1817)|
| 0:30:19| Everything that we can do to educate and get more gardens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1819)|
| 0:30:22| get more healthy food in our communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1822)|
| 0:30:25| and teach our young and all of our citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1825)|
| 0:30:27| where our food comes from, and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1827)|
| 0:30:30| important to help bring more fresh food to all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1830)|
| 0:30:32| of those in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1832)|
| 0:30:34| As a member of the Knoxville, Knox County Food Policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1834)|
| 0:30:37| Council, I strongly urge the council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| to pass the Urban Agriculture Ordinance tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1839)|
| 0:30:41| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1841)|
| 0:30:42| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1842)|
| 0:30:46| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1846)|
| 0:30:47| Councilman Dallavopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1847)|
| 0:30:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1848)|
| 0:30:51| I find myself at a crossroad here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1851)|
| 0:30:53| but I may reluctantly support this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1853)|
| 0:30:55| But I am still and remain disappointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1855)|
| 0:30:58| that we are having government intrude in individual backyards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1858)|
| 0:31:03| Let me separate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1863)|
| 0:31:04| Obviously, urban agriculture and doing things in community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1864)|
| 0:31:08| gardens and in special areas, I think that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1868)|
| 0:31:11| And I think the extent that we support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1871)|
| 0:31:14| that and make it easier to do and encourage it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1874)|
| 0:31:18| I think we're doing the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| But I really don't think government needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1880)|
| 0:31:22| to be in people's backyards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1882)|
| 0:31:23| And I'm concerned about the private garden regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| The second thing I would like to mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| is I am concerned still that having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1888)|
| 0:31:33| these food stands in neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| could cause traffic jams and other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| I don't know that individual property owners need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1897)|
| 0:31:41| to be running food stands in neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1901)|
| 0:31:44| And as nice as that sounds, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1904)|
| 0:31:47| we ought to encourage the farmers markets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1907)|
| 0:31:50| and places like that to sell food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1910)|
| 0:31:53| and to make it available to others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| So those two things still trouble me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| I'm going to reluctantly support it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| but I wish those are looked at very closely and revised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1919)|
| 0:32:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1923)|
| 0:32:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1924)|
| 0:32:05| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1925)|
| 0:32:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1926)|
| 0:32:07| I've done a lot of research about urban agriculture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1927)|
| 0:32:09| because I was not clear what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1929)|
| 0:32:11| And I've learned far more than I wanted to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| And I do like to eat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| so I understand that this is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| Somewhat like Councilman De La Vope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1939)|
| 0:32:22| I'm concerned that we're overreaching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1942)|
| 0:32:24| and overstepping the boundaries that we need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1944)|
| 0:32:28| in advising people or setting up ways to grow food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1948)|
| 0:32:34| that are not necessarily compatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1954)|
| 0:32:37| with many concepts of city living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1957)|
| 0:32:41| I had a number of people contact me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1961)|
| 0:32:44| They'd get some questions answered about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1964)|
| 0:32:47| One of the issues was the produce stand in the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1967)|
| 0:32:51| Another one was the fact that there is no provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1971)|
| 0:32:56| to create a barrier between what you're growing in the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1976)|
| 0:33:00| It can go right to the edge of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1980)|
| 0:33:02| Another issue that bothered people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1982)|
| 0:33:05| was the abandoned gardens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1985)|
| 0:33:08| Someone said, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1988)|
| 0:33:10| my buddies and I thought this would be a great deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1990)|
| 0:33:12| to have a little garden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| and we were doing fine until the weather got hot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1994)|
| 0:33:17| and then we don't like to work in the garden anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| It's too hot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=1999)|
| 0:33:20| And we also don't like to water it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2000)|
| 0:33:22| because then that makes our KGB bill go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2002)|
| 0:33:25| So I'm not comfortable that this is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2005)|
| 0:33:29| that will be embraced by some people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2009)|
| 0:33:32| who really know what they're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| and other people will think, oh, this is a fad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| My neighbor's got a garden. I need a garden, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2016)|
| 0:33:38| So I cannot support this as it's written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2018)|
| 0:33:43| We have gardens, and I think that's terrific,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2023)|
| 0:33:46| but I just have a real problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| with the intrusion of government into this gardening process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2028)|
| 0:33:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2032)|
| 0:33:53| Councilman Grave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2033)|
| 0:33:54| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2034)|
| 0:33:55| First of all, I want to thank Erin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| for being at the Bearden Council the other day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2037)|
| 0:33:59| and answering a number of questions that they had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2039)|
| 0:34:02| But afterwards, there were still some questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2042)|
| 0:34:04| that came to mind that maybe, Erin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2044)|
| 0:34:07| you've taken care of it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2049)|
| 0:34:10| But those questions concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2050)|
| 0:34:13| the questions came up in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2053)|
| 0:34:15| what's the difference between ornamental gardens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| and landscape gardens, and what is a vegetable garden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2057)|
| 0:34:20| and how much vegetable garden can be in a front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2060)|
| 0:34:23| Can you go from property line to property line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2063)|
| 0:34:26| Are there any setback requirements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| There was a concern over this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| There was also a concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| and a number of people got into this in much detail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2072)|
| 0:34:35| and I do want to preface this by saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| that they're all for sustainability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2077)|
| 0:34:39| and they look forward to something like this happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| but their concerns were as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2082)|
| 0:34:45| One of the concerns had to do with the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2085)|
| 0:34:48| that we know that we have rabbits and raccoons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| and this sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2090)|
| 0:34:51| and how are we going to keep those out of the gardens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2091)|
| 0:34:53| and does that mean then we'll be erecting fences in the front?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2093)|
| 0:34:56| There was a concern over raised beds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| and how those might be treated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2098)|
| 0:35:00| So there was really some concern about more of the detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2100)|
| 0:35:03| of things that were missing from the document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2103)|
| 0:35:05| that they thought should go in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2105)|
| 0:35:07| The other big issue that came up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2107)|
| 0:35:09| is in terms of community gardens or even getting a permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2109)|
| 0:35:13| is whether or not there ought to be a use-on-review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| whereas if there is a use-on-review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| for a community garden and the neighbors would know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2117)|
| 0:35:19| that that would be happening in that particular area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2119)|
| 0:35:22| or an individual having a garden themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2122)|
| 0:35:26| Like Council Palmer said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2126)|
| 0:35:30| there was a concern over the food stands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| and the fact that food stands could be out for nine months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2132)|
| 0:35:35| That was a concern in terms of some of the folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2137)|
| 0:35:39| So those were the major items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2139)|
| 0:35:42| Questions came up in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2142)|
| 0:35:46| if there is a garden in the front yard and it's plowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2146)|
| 0:35:49| and it goes from property line to property line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| and then there's fertilizer that's put into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| what happens to the runoff and this sort of thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| that was concerns about that also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2155)|
| 0:35:57| in terms of how people were going to garden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| So these were some of the concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| that I think ought to be looked into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2161)|
| 0:36:03| and maybe written up and just tightened up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2163)|
| 0:36:05| the ordinance in itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| I was just going to say Erin Gill is here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| and she'd be interested in coming up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2173)|
| 0:36:15| and replying to some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| Erin, do you want to say a few words?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2177)|
| 0:36:21| Well, thank you, Council, and thank you, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| for all of the great consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2183)|
| 0:36:26| the very thoughtful feedback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2186)|
| 0:36:27| not only that we've received from you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2187)|
| 0:36:29| but also the constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2189)|
| 0:36:31| And Councilman Grieve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2191)|
| 0:36:32| I appreciate being at the Bearden Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| and we enjoyed, as we always do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| talking and hearing from the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2196)|
| 0:36:39| Just wanted to touch on a couple things that were said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2199)|
| 0:36:42| and especially those that I haven't had a chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2202)|
| 0:36:44| to directly respond to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2204)|
| 0:36:45| and would be happy to answer those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| or any other questions that come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2207)|
| 0:36:50| I think we heard today sort of the two sides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2210)|
| 0:36:54| that we really tried to balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| as we created this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2216)|
| 0:36:57| and that's what is the role of government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2217)|
| 0:37:00| and how do we balance the concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| over property rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2222)|
| 0:37:03| and what government can say and not say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2223)|
| 0:37:05| to how individual property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2225)|
| 0:37:07| choose to use their land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2227)|
| 0:37:09| versus where is that right role to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2229)|
| 0:37:11| yes, you're doing something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2231)|
| 0:37:12| that's going to impact your neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| and we need to take a close look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2234)|
| 0:37:15| So we really tried to strike that balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| and we appreciate both sides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| sort of bringing those arguments to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| and to the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2241)|
| 0:37:24| One of the ways that we evaluated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2244)|
| 0:37:29| how we define gardens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2249)|
| 0:37:31| and this speaks to your point, Councilman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| about what's decorative versus what's agricultural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2253)|
| 0:37:36| and I think that that is not necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2256)|
| 0:37:39| an enforceable standard or a definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2259)|
| 0:37:42| that the government can really not only enact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2262)|
| 0:37:46| but really enforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2266)|
| 0:37:47| I mean, I think that it comes down to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2267)|
| 0:37:49| how someone has chosen to use lettuce, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2269)|
| 0:37:52| I think there's actually some beautiful planters downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| that have lettuce in them for decorative purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2274)|
| 0:37:57| So I think we start entering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| into very murky regulation territory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2279)|
| 0:38:01| when we start defining what's decorative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| versus what's agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2283)|
| 0:38:04| when it comes to what's being used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| on an individual's lot for landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| So we've kept that out for that reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2288)|
| 0:38:10| I wanted to speak a little bit, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| to sort of the distinction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2292)|
| 0:38:13| between community gardens and market gardens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| and we heard several speakers today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2295)|
| 0:38:16| and I really appreciate Food Policy Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| and the farmers' market and their input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| because we do recognize that there's an interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| in this more intensive market use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| and we wanted to create some very clear frameworks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2305)|
| 0:38:27| by which that could happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2307)|
| 0:38:29| while not necessarily opening up the floodgates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| for that to happen in every individual community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2311)|
| 0:38:33| So where we looked at it is that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2313)|
| 0:38:35| community garden, you're not selling food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| if you're running a community garden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2317)|
| 0:38:38| If you start selling food, you're a market garden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| You need to go through use and review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2320)|
| 0:38:41| so that your neighbors have a chance to weigh in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| on that more intensive use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2323)|
| 0:38:44| that's going on in their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2324)|
| 0:38:46| Community gardens, we see, is less intensive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| and we, I think, spoke earlier at the first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2328)|
| 0:38:51| about how community gardens really can be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2331)|
| 0:38:54| to help abate some issues in food deserts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| and we think about the very small groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2336)|
| 0:38:57| that are starting those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2337)|
| 0:38:58| and some, you know, to Councilman Palmer's point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2338)|
| 0:39:00| that, you know, may hit fits and starts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2340)|
| 0:39:02| but those are very small and oftentimes informal groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2342)|
| 0:39:05| that are operating on individual private property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| not government property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2347)|
| 0:39:08| and to go through a use and review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| for that type of circumstance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2350)|
| 0:39:11| could very quickly sort of squash a project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2351)|
| 0:39:15| You know, I think we think about the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2355)|
| 0:39:17| that's associated with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2357)|
| 0:39:18| and the fact that they're not going to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2358)|
| 0:39:19| to earn money or gain a profit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| off of what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2361)|
| 0:39:22| It's really to give away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2362)|
| 0:39:23| and we think about how that could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2363)|
| 0:39:26| a very onerous process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2366)|
| 0:39:27| for maybe not necessarily a huge intensive use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2367)|
| 0:39:30| So that was one consideration that we looked closely at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| I did want to address parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2373)|
| 0:39:34| because that was something that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2374)|
| 0:39:35| as we were developing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2375)|
| 0:39:36| we looked at extremely, as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2376)|
| 0:39:39| the city loves our parking policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2379)|
| 0:39:41| So we looked at that very closely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| and we looked at what the community gardens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2383)|
| 0:39:46| were experiencing now in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2386)|
| 0:39:48| and did not find known parking issues related to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2388)|
| 0:39:51| So, you know, as we looked at our existing parking rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2391)|
| 0:39:54| that prohibit standing, stopping, and roadways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2394)|
| 0:39:57| that gives us the tools we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2397)|
| 0:39:58| to deal with any parking issues that might come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2398)|
| 0:40:01| from either an individual selling produce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| through incidental sales or through a market garden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| or through a community garden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2405)|
| 0:40:06| maybe not selling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2406)|
| 0:40:07| but having people on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| So we think that our existing parking ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| is in a good position to be able to deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2411)|
| 0:40:12| with those problems as they arise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2412)|
| 0:40:16| So we hope that that can address some of those concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| at least as it gets off the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2419)|
| 0:40:22| You know, I think runoff is one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| and the sort of potential shifting of sediment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2424)|
| 0:40:28| from one property to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2428)|
| 0:40:29| It's a very valid concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2429)|
| 0:40:30| We did work with our stormwater team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2430)|
| 0:40:32| and had them review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2432)|
| 0:40:33| and based on their feedback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2433)|
| 0:40:34| we added some language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2434)|
| 0:40:36| to our composting supplementary regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2436)|
| 0:40:40| making sort of sure that people knew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2440)|
| 0:40:42| if you were in a riparian zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2442)|
| 0:40:43| you can't put your compost pile in a riparian zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2443)|
| 0:40:46| to prevent that stormwater runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2446)|
| 0:40:49| So we did, you know, get some feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2449)|
| 0:40:50| from our stormwater team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2450)|
| 0:40:52| in instances where there might be a major nuisance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2452)|
| 0:40:57| Again, we haven't seen that so far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2457)|
| 0:40:58| but if there is a major nuisance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2458)|
| 0:40:59| then we do have stormwater enforcement teams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| that can go out and deal with that problem as it arises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2461)|
| 0:41:05| So I know there are a variety of other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2465)|
| 0:41:08| that were raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2468)|
| 0:41:09| I'm happy to talk to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2469)|
| 0:41:10| Let me mention STAND,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2470)|
| 0:41:11| since that was mentioned several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2471)|
| 0:41:13| The current temporary sale of produce permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2473)|
| 0:41:17| is on the books already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| It does not define exactly what is allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| It says modular or sectional, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2481)|
| 0:41:23| We've actually tightened that language in this proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2483)|
| 0:41:26| to make it much more clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2486)|
| 0:41:27| that what we are referring to there is a cart or a table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2487)|
| 0:41:30| It must be removed when it's not in use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2490)|
| 0:41:32| So we've added some additional language there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2492)|
| 0:41:34| to make clear that this is not a permanent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2494)|
| 0:41:37| or even semi-permanent structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2497)|
| 0:41:39| This is really a table or a cart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2499)|
| 0:41:40| by which an individual is either giving away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2500)|
| 0:41:42| or potentially selling some extra produce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2502)|
| 0:41:45| from their garden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| I'll say, too, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2507)|
| 0:41:48| we think about when it becomes a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| I think that's what we're all concerned about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2510)|
| 0:41:51| is a residential use becoming a business use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| And there is a state business license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| when you hit $3,000 that it's no longer a hobby,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2515)|
| 0:41:59| that it's a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2519)|
| 0:42:00| And so we think that offers a little bit of a line in the sand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2520)|
| 0:42:03| between when something might be coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| a much more intensive use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2525)|
| 0:42:06| than what's envisioned for that permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2526)|
| 0:42:08| So, again, I'm happy to answer any more specifics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2528)|
| 0:42:11| but I know I wanted to throw those out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| Thank you, Erin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2533)|
| 0:42:15| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2535)|
| 0:42:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2536)|
| 0:42:17| You mentioned, if you don't mind returning just for a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2537)|
| 0:42:21| you mentioned food desert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| and I would like for you to maybe give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2543)|
| 0:42:26| a little definition of food desert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| It's a relatively new term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2548)|
| 0:42:30| and a lot of people may not know what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2550)|
| 0:42:32| Secondly, how will this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2552)|
| 0:42:35| if it's passed, the urban agriculture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2555)|
| 0:42:38| what impact it would have on areas that are in food deserts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2558)|
| 0:42:44| I know in my district we have several food deserts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2564)|
| 0:42:48| So if you would address that, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2568)|
| 0:42:50| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2570)|
| 0:42:51| So it's actually a statistical definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2571)|
| 0:42:54| that comes out of the USDA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2574)|
| 0:42:55| and other groups have sort of taken slight variations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2575)|
| 0:42:58| but it looks at the distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2578)|
| 0:43:01| between a neighborhood and the nearest grocery store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2581)|
| 0:43:06| a true grocery store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2586)|
| 0:43:07| where they can get healthy fruits and vegetables,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| not just the frozen convenience food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2589)|
| 0:43:11| that we might see in a corner store market or a gas station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2591)|
| 0:43:15| So it takes into account the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| and also the principal means of transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2597)|
| 0:43:20| by which that neighborhood would access the grocery store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2600)|
| 0:43:22| So I know we can think of some neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2602)|
| 0:43:24| that might be several miles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2604)|
| 0:43:25| but everyone is a car-centric neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| versus neighborhoods where not everyone has cars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| and therefore a mile is a much longer distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| So it looks at those factors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2611)|
| 0:43:33| and sort of evaluates those that are considered too far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2613)|
| 0:43:37| from a nearest grocery store or other healthy food access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2617)|
| 0:43:41| including in the case of a farmer's market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| that would be considered something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| that would help abate a food desert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2625)|
| 0:43:49| So when we look at how our ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2629)|
| 0:43:52| can help abate food desert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2632)|
| 0:43:53| it's because we're opening up more opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| for those community gardens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2635)|
| 0:43:56| to take advantage of vacant lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2636)|
| 0:43:59| privately owned vacant lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2639)|
| 0:44:00| that can be used by community groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2640)|
| 0:44:02| by neighborhood associations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2642)|
| 0:44:03| by nonprofits to grow food on that lot to distribute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2643)|
| 0:44:07| either through a community garden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2647)|
| 0:44:08| distribute that for free to their neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| or to their families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2650)|
| 0:44:11| or in the case of a market garden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| could actually be used to sell that food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2655)|
| 0:44:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2657)|
| 0:44:18| Councilman Grave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2658)|
| 0:44:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2659)|
| 0:44:20| Erin, first of all, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2660)|
| 0:44:21| I want to thank you for all the work that you've done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2661)|
| 0:44:22| and when did you start this ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2662)|
| 0:44:24| Well, I think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2664)|
| 0:44:25| actually James Boese captured it really well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| We went to Memphis back in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2667)|
| 0:44:28| I think it was September of 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2668)|
| 0:44:31| So you haven't spent four years yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| Not quite four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2675)|
| 0:44:36| I do have another question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2676)|
| 0:44:38| that came up at the Bearden Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2678)|
| 0:44:40| and thanks again for coming there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2680)|
| 0:44:41| The food stands, I understand now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| they can have a permit for nine months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| Would you explain the reason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| Yeah, so it is that nine months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2687)|
| 0:44:48| does represent an expansion from what's on the books now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2688)|
| 0:44:51| We extended that because that matches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| our farmer's market season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2693)|
| 0:44:54| So there's farmer's markets that start in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2694)|
| 0:44:57| They run through November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2697)|
| 0:44:58| It's a nine month out of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| So we wanted to match that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2700)|
| 0:45:01| because that's sort of the reasonable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| what we thought was a reasonable amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| Some folks we heard from said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| you know, hey, I grow food all year long, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2707)|
| 0:45:09| and, you know, that's a balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| What we wanted to do is if we made it a year-round permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| then it's not really temporary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| And then what's the cost of a permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| $100, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| Yeah, $100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2719)|
| 0:45:21| So it is a little bit of a hurdle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2721)|
| 0:45:22| but I think that goes to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| if someone's really committed and wants to sell food,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| then that's worth it to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2726)|
| 0:45:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2728)|
| 0:45:29| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2729)|
| 0:45:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=2732)|

| 0:56:57| Councilman Dellavapi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3417)|
| 0:56:58| Yeah, just one of the mentions since the caption doesn't, that this would require vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3418)|
| 0:57:04| to allow three-feet clearance as they're passing a bicycle, and that's for the safety certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3424)|
| 0:57:10| of the riders and folks who are trying to share the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3430)|
| 0:57:16| There are lots of places in this town where the road pavement is basically right to the edge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3436)|
| 0:57:23| the lines that mark the lanes for traffic, and sometimes you just can't get over any further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3443)|
| 0:57:30| I know bicyclists try to accommodate the vehicles behind them, but sometimes they just have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3450)|
| 0:57:38| to have that extra margin of safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3458)|
| 0:57:41| I would ask the police representative, I understand that technically you can't cross the double| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3461)|
| 0:57:47| yellow line in passing, but everyone does it, and I'll confess that I've done it when passing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3467)|
| 0:57:53| a cyclist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3473)|
| 0:57:54| I don't think you're supposed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3474)|
| 0:57:55| They're supposed to be treated like any other vehicle, but everyone hopefully wants to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3475)|
| 0:58:00| for the safety of the person who's riding on that roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3480)|
| 0:58:04| Maybe you could address the rules of the road as far as that's concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3484)|
| 0:58:09| Councilman, that's a very good question, and no, you are not supposed to cross the double yellow line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3489)|
| 0:58:14| but I would hope that the drivers would have the good judgment to move over enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3494)|
| 0:58:22| If there's no oncoming traffic, if you're not on a blind hill, if you're not in a curve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3502)|
| 0:58:26| it's going to take good judgment on the driver's part to pass in a safe area, and I think the officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3506)|
| 0:58:32| would be understanding of that if they were doing that to pass a bicyclist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3512)|
| 0:58:35| That doesn't give folks free reign to be reckless as they pass, but we could be understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3515)|
| 0:58:43| in the knowledge that drivers are required to have that three-foot buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3523)|
| 0:58:48| Appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3528)|
| 0:58:49| You know, sometimes there's just nothing but a ditch facing you on the side of the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3529)|
| 0:58:53| and if you don't have that clearance, it gets kind of spooky, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3533)|
| 0:58:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3538)|

| 0:59:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3540)|
| 0:59:01| This is for Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3541)|
| 0:59:03| Do we not have a state law that says essentially the same thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3543)|
| 0:59:08| You are correct, Councilmember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3548)|
| 0:59:11| There is a state law that does the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3551)|
| 0:59:15| By doing this, this allows the police department the flexibility to cite an offending motor vehicle driver| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3555)|
| 0:59:25| to either state court or to city court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3565)|
| 0:59:29| And so this discretion is not something I always thought that state laws superseded local laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3569)|
| 0:59:38| but obviously I learned wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3578)|
| 0:59:40| Well, this, I guess, might be complementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3580)|

| 1:00:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3646)|
| 1:00:47| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3647)|
| 1:00:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3648)|
| 1:00:49| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3649)|
| 1:00:51| What I'd like to do to move this along is to go ahead and make a motion that we approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3651)|
| 1:00:55| and hopefully there will be a second, and then have public comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3655)|
| 1:00:58| and then have discussion as we go through the amendments that were asked for, if there are any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3658)|
| 1:01:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3664)|
| 1:01:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3665)|
| 1:01:06| So now we have the motion and the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3666)|
| 1:01:07| And we have some people who are signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3667)|
| 1:01:10| Would you like to hear from them first, or do you want to speak right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3670)|
| 1:01:13| I wanted to clarify one thing, and that was I hope we'll do what we did last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3673)|
| 1:01:17| and if we have comments as council, we'll take each article or section group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3677)|
| 1:01:22| and see if we have anything in that group, rather than being all over the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3682)|
| 1:01:25| It's easier to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3685)|
| 1:01:26| We'll just go through it that way, if that's what you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3686)|
| 1:01:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3689)|
| 1:01:30| We have signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3690)|
| 1:01:34| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3694)|
| 1:01:35| Let's work with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3695)|
| 1:01:38| To speak for the ordinance, we have Joyce Feld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3698)|
| 1:01:44| And then we have three people signed up to speak against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3704)|
| 1:01:50| And so that's Steve Ridenour, Tom Johnson, and John King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3710)|
| 1:01:55| So we'll start with Joyce Feld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| Miss Feld, thanks for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3717)|
| 1:01:59| As you know, you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3719)|
| 1:02:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3721)|
| 1:02:02| Set your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3722)|
| 1:02:03| I just want to hand some things out to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3723)|
| 1:02:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3726)|
| 1:02:13| I'm going to pass that for her so she can start speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3733)|
| 1:02:32| Thank you, Mayor O'Hara, and thank you, council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3752)|
| 1:02:35| My name is Joyce Feld, 1540 Aguila Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3755)|
| 1:02:42| We have or are passing out recommendations for sign sizes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3762)|
| 1:02:48| along with the heights and sizes for several other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3768)|
| 1:02:53| We think our suggestions are commensurate with these other cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3773)|
| 1:02:57| and appropriate for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3777)|
| 1:03:01| Can you find cities that allow taller and bigger signs than these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3781)|
| 1:03:05| Sure you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3785)|
| 1:03:07| But that doesn't mean that they're good models for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3787)|
| 1:03:10| Knoxville currently allows 50-foot tall signs almost everywhere, as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3790)|
| 1:03:14| and I don't think most of you would recommend that any other city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3794)|
| 1:03:18| in the process of revising their ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3798)|
| 1:03:20| would use our current ordinance as a model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3800)|
| 1:03:23| So just because it's out there doesn't make it a good ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3803)|
| 1:03:29| Please note that in the last two categories of our table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3809)|
| 1:03:33| the one that's headed maximum sign areas supported by scenic Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3813)|
| 1:03:37| and I forgot to say I'm here as president of scenic Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3817)|
| 1:03:42| Please note that in the last two categories, the height remains the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3822)|
| 1:03:47| but monument signs are allowed more square footage than pole signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3827)|
| 1:03:53| Hopefully this will provide an incentive to choose a monument sign over a pole sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3833)|
| 1:03:59| which we think are more attractive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3839)|
| 1:04:02| Please also remember that the majority of businesses will also have a prominent wall sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3842)|
| 1:04:07| and many businesses are easily identifiable by the design of their building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3847)|
| 1:04:13| In fact, some businesses choose not to even have a detached sign at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3853)|
| 1:04:17| and an example of this is Anthropologie that moved into Bearden a couple of years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3857)|
| 1:04:22| and has no ground sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3862)|
| 1:04:26| In contrast, the chamber has engaged a Mr. James Carpentier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3866)|
| 1:04:31| and I apologize to Mr. Carpentier if I'm not pronouncing his name correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3871)|
| 1:04:38| who is recommending some sign sizes that are larger than some billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3878)|
| 1:04:45| With all due respect to Mr. Carpentier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3885)|
| 1:04:48| I think it should be noted that he's a licensed lobbyist for the sign industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3888)|
| 1:04:53| He earns his living by trying to convince governmental bodies like yours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3893)|
| 1:04:59| not to restrict signage because it will have a negative impact on the industry that he represents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3899)|
| 1:05:05| His allegiance and commitment are not to the city of Knoxville or the people of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3905)|
| 1:05:11| We don't even know if Mr. Carpentier has ever been in Knoxville before today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3911)|
| 1:05:15| Please remember that he's not your constituent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3915)|
| 1:05:18| but the people who sent you over 400 emails saying they wanted significantly lower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3918)|
| 1:05:23| and smaller signs are your constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3923)|
| 1:05:27| I know that Mr. Carpentier has also cited studies as evidence for his point of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3927)|
| 1:05:32| These studies were done at the request of the sign industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3932)|
| 1:05:36| and received funding from the sign industry, which throws their validity into question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3936)|
| 1:05:43| In contrast, two weeks ago Kevin Murphy presented data to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3943)|
| 1:05:48| on the economic vitality of Colorado Springs, Colorado,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3948)|
| 1:05:51| after dramatically cleaning up their sign clutter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3951)|
| 1:05:55| There are other examples of improved economic activity after instituting a good ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3955)|
| 1:06:06| Scenic Knoxville, along with many citizens and neighborhood groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3966)|
| 1:06:10| hope that you will seriously consider this table and also adopt it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3970)|
| 1:06:16| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3976)|
| 1:06:18| Cindy, I did not know this was your last meeting tonight when I spoke to you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3978)|
| 1:06:22| Good luck and good health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3982)|
| 1:06:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3984)|
| 1:06:25| Thank you, Ms. Fell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3985)|
| 1:06:27| Okay, now Steve Ridenour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3987)|
| 1:06:30| How do you pronounce that, Steve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3990)|
| 1:06:32| Ridenour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3992)|
| 1:06:33| Ridenour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3993)|
| 1:06:34| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3994)|
| 1:06:35| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3995)|
| 1:06:36| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3996)|
| 1:06:37| Steve Ridenour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3997)|
| 1:06:38| My address is 2209 Hauser Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=3998)|
| 1:06:43| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4003)|
| 1:06:44| I appreciate the time to speak to you this afternoon, Mayor Rogero and council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4004)|
| 1:06:50| I really want to start by saying that good neighborhoods are residential areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4010)|
| 1:06:56| with vibrant, successful businesses in close proximity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4016)|
| 1:06:59| so there's places to work, jobs, and the amenities that they offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4019)|
| 1:07:04| I recently attended a global meeting with the International Council of Shopping Centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4024)|
| 1:07:10| This convention had attendees from every growing country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4030)|
| 1:07:14| There was a panel of tenants, landlords, lawyers, and real estate professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4034)|
| 1:07:20| They were asked the question, why is there a decline of shopping centers and malls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4040)|
| 1:07:26| but a growing demand for single-tenant buildings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4046)|
| 1:07:30| The overwhelming answer was eyes sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4050)|
| 1:07:35| This takes more space and causes sprawling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4055)|
| 1:07:40| You've seen the schools move into the shopping centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4060)|
| 1:07:44| You've seen churches move into the shopping centers, but you're seeing more single-tenant tenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4064)|
| 1:07:50| The signage is necessary for these businesses to survive and be vibrant and successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4070)|
| 1:07:58| It is about visibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4078)|
| 1:08:00| Visibility is what businesses need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4080)|
| 1:08:04| We talk to tenants and customers every day about signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4084)|
| 1:08:09| As a company, we have our own signage regulations that are very strict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4089)|
| 1:08:13| We require cut letters over 50% of the signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4093)|
| 1:08:17| We require them to be lit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4097)|
| 1:08:19| Our standards are very high, and we know that it does create the neighborhood of that shopping center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4099)|
| 1:08:27| And if you do not have signage regulations, it is not good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4107)|
| 1:08:32| and it decreases the value of the property and the opportunities of the tenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4112)|
| 1:08:39| Some of these signage budgets are $50,000 to $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4119)|
| 1:08:43| These signs that we're talking about are not cheap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4123)|
| 1:08:48| These businesses only spend this money because they need to succeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4128)|
| 1:08:53| That's their only purpose of spending that kind of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4133)|
| 1:08:56| It's ironic that 90% of the sign companies are in the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4136)|
| 1:09:03| All your major ones are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4143)|
| 1:09:05| We've built several of them, and they're in the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4145)|
| 1:09:09| I'm going to give you an example of an issue that my office came up with that hit us just like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4149)|
| 1:09:15| We've got a sign at Centerline on a medical office building that we manage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4155)|
| 1:09:20| That sign's been used by St. Mary's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4160)|
| 1:09:23| It was refaced for Tenova, and we're talking to a tenant right now about this space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4163)|
| 1:09:30| and they asked if they could reuse that sign, and I said, I can't tell you I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4170)|
| 1:09:35| That sign may have to be taken down after it's had two great tenants use it because of its height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4175)|
| 1:09:44| That's one example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4184)|
| 1:09:46| There's thousands of them in this city that if you all pass what you proposed, July the 7th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4186)|
| 1:09:52| will be affecting so many pieces of property that it's just not good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4192)|
| 1:10:00| I ask you to please follow MPC's recommendation to approve the sign task force recommendation as it was written and presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4200)|
| 1:10:10| I sincerely think that the businesses and the communities, residential, can get along together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4210)|
| 1:10:16| but they both have to be vibrant and have an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4216)|
| 1:10:20| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4220)|
| 1:10:21| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4221)|
| 1:10:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4222)|
| 1:10:24| Now Mr. Johnson, Tom Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4224)|
| 1:10:29| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4229)|
| 1:10:30| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4230)|
| 1:10:32| Tom Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4232)|
| 1:10:33| I live at 10005 Autumn Valley Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4233)|
| 1:10:37| I thank you all for letting me have a chance to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4237)|
| 1:10:40| I don't have anything formal written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4240)|
| 1:10:41| I'm just going to talk off the cuff because that's just what I know how to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4241)|
| 1:10:45| We've been in business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4245)|
| 1:10:46| We operate Arby's Roast Beef restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4246)|
| 1:10:48| We've been in business since 1968.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4248)|
| 1:10:50| That's over a decade longer than Cindy's worked for the city as a city reporter, so it's a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4250)|
| 1:10:57| We've been very pleased with the way Knoxville has accepted us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4257)|
| 1:11:01| We have done our best to return back to the community through charitable events that some of you are aware of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4261)|
| 1:11:09| and many that you are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4269)|
| 1:11:11| We are a third generation business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4271)|
| 1:11:14| I have my two children sitting in here with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4274)|
| 1:11:18| Hopefully I'll be able to transfer to the lake or the beach or somewhere so they can take it over soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4278)|
| 1:11:23| But it concerns me that the task force spends somewhere close to three years to review this issue of signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4283)|
| 1:11:37| MPC approves it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4297)|
| 1:11:41| Two weeks ago I witnessed a change to what was proposed and approved by MPC or recommended by MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4301)|
| 1:11:55| that happened so swiftly and with more on emotion than on facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4315)|
| 1:12:00| Signage is important to businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4320)|
| 1:12:04| The gentleman is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4324)|
| 1:12:05| It costs a fortune to raise a sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4325)|
| 1:12:09| We don't spend $50,000, $75,000 to build a sign because we don't need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4329)|
| 1:12:17| We put it up because it attracts people to our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4337)|
| 1:12:22| With what was passed two weeks ago, I don't know what the percentage is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4342)|
| 1:12:29| but I bet it's over 95% of the streets in Knoxville will not be able to have a sign higher than 10 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4349)|
| 1:12:35| I can't drive behind another SUV or minivan or even just a tall car| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4355)|
| 1:12:40| and see something 100 yards down the road that's only 10 feet tall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4360)|
| 1:12:46| My vision is blocked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4366)|
| 1:12:49| When you're looking for a business you're not familiar with, you're doing a lot of head turning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4369)|
| 1:12:54| It could almost be considered not as dangerous as texting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4374)|
| 1:12:57| but it takes your eyes off of the cars in front of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4377)|
| 1:13:00| when you're studying the environment and scenery around to try to find a business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4380)|
| 1:13:06| that you just can't locate because there's not appropriate signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4386)|
| 1:13:10| So I urge you to reconsider that one item in particular of a maximum height of 10 foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4390)|
| 1:13:20| for a sign on a road that is not a federal highway or adjacent to an interstate right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4400)|
| 1:13:27| It's just restrictive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4407)|
| 1:13:29| There's hundreds and hundreds of business people that are struggling every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4409)|
| 1:13:33| to provide jobs and product for Knoxville citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4413)|
| 1:13:39| Knoxville is a great place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4419)|
| 1:13:40| I would never consider moving anywhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4420)|
| 1:13:44| But it would be nice to have a fair shot at doing business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4424)|
| 1:13:48| rather than being restricted to the point that what happened two weeks ago did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4428)|
| 1:13:52| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4432)|
| 1:13:53| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4433)|
| 1:13:55| And now Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4435)|
| 1:13:59| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4439)|
| 1:14:02| Mayor, members of Council, John King, 620 Market Street in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4442)|
| 1:14:09| I'm going to request again the opportunity to make my comments later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4449)|
| 1:14:14| because I think I put against-maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4454)|
| 1:14:20| There may be things done to this ordinance by way of amendments or changing of definitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4460)|
| 1:14:26| that I'd like to have the opportunity to speak to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4466)|
| 1:14:28| I'd like to speak to this, and I may not even speak to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4468)|
| 1:14:32| but I'd like the opportunity to speak to it after I know finally what it's going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4472)|
| 1:14:37| Just remember, by the rules, you can speak now, and then any other discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4477)|
| 1:14:42| then it will depend on a Council member calling on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4482)|
| 1:14:46| I made my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4486)|
| 1:14:47| I don't want to talk about it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4487)|
| 1:14:48| I would prefer to talk about it once I know what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4488)|
| 1:14:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4494)|
| 1:14:59| So now Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4499)|
| 1:15:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4500)|
| 1:15:02| Two weeks ago when we considered the heights for the signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4502)|
| 1:15:06| and then we moved to the area the sign would cover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4506)|
| 1:15:09| and numbers were flying around without any real backing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4509)|
| 1:15:14| other than I feel like that it could be this size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4514)|
| 1:15:18| that really concerned me because it really hit home the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4518)|
| 1:15:22| that we are not individually experts in signs, their usage, information about them, specific facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4522)|
| 1:15:33| And so I chose to reach out to find somebody who could help me specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4533)|
| 1:15:38| with the area of a sign based on the height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4538)|
| 1:15:41| And in that regard, I contacted Representative Martin Daniel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4541)|
| 1:15:47| and he does have a sign business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4547)|
| 1:15:49| and then he connected me to the Chamber of Commerce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4549)|
| 1:15:53| And the Chamber had someone come in today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4553)|
| 1:15:55| I met with him this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4555)|
| 1:15:57| Perhaps other Council members did too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4557)|
| 1:15:59| and he really did help me understand a lot better about the signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4559)|
| 1:16:03| And before I ask permission for him to speak, I do want to say that I represent the 3rd District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4563)|
| 1:16:10| and under the sign height we passed last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4570)|
| 1:16:14| we only have one federal highway in the 3rd District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4574)|
| 1:16:18| and it goes only about two miles at the very most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4578)|
| 1:16:23| Every other road in the 3rd District that has 25,000 people would have a limit of 10 feet for a sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4583)|
| 1:16:33| I think it would create an economic hardship on an area of our city that continues to grow and develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4593)|
| 1:16:39| I think it would affect employment if we don't have increased development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4599)|
| 1:16:44| And so that really concerns me that our district, my 3rd District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4604)|
| 1:16:49| is really not getting to be a part of the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4609)|
| 1:16:54| because we only have one federal highway that goes to Clinton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4614)|
| 1:16:57| and it just passes through a small part of my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4617)|
| 1:17:01| So with that in mind, I was very happy today to learn a little bit about signage that I did not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4621)|
| 1:17:07| And I really wished that we had had this information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4627)|
| 1:17:12| or been privy to this much earlier in the process before we had four workshops and marathon meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4632)|
| 1:17:20| so that we would have maybe a little bit more sound basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4640)|
| 1:17:24| So with the indulgence of counsel, I'd like to request that James Carpentier come to speak to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4644)|
| 1:17:33| and I'd like him to specifically tell his credentials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4653)|
| 1:17:36| and then I have about four or five questions to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4656)|
| 1:17:39| Counsel, will you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4659)|
| 1:17:41| Is there any objection from counsel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4661)|
| 1:17:43| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4663)|
| 1:17:44| Mr. Carpentier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4664)|
| 1:17:46| Would you please spell that, too, for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4666)|
| 1:17:49| And I probably mispronounced it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4669)|
| 1:17:53| James Carpentier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4673)|
| 1:17:54| I kind of like the carpentier, though, so either way is fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4674)|
| 1:17:59| But James Carpentier here on behalf of the Mid-South Sign Association and also the Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4679)|
| 1:18:04| Please spell that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4684)|
| 1:18:05| Please spell your name for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4685)|
| 1:18:06| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4686)|
| 1:18:07| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4687)|
| 1:18:08| It's C-A-R-P-E-N-T-I-E-R.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4688)|
| 1:18:12| Here on behalf of the Mid-South Sign Association, and, yes, that's who I do work for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4692)|
| 1:18:16| is the Mid-South Sign Association and the International Sign Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4696)|
| 1:18:20| That's who I represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4700)|
| 1:18:22| And all the costs involved with my trip here are paid for by the International Sign Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4702)|
| 1:18:29| And I just wanted to mention, too, that we represent the on-premise sign industry only, not the off-premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4709)|
| 1:18:37| That's a whole other ballgame, the off-premise industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4717)|
| 1:18:41| And the oh, my background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4721)|
| 1:18:47| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4727)|
| 1:18:48| I almost skipped that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4728)|
| 1:18:49| My background is a certified planner for 25 years in the public and private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4729)|
| 1:18:54| And early on in my career, I started dealing with sign regulation that sucked throughout my career| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4734)|
| 1:18:59| and was eventually asked to do this type of work with the sign industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4739)|
| 1:19:05| and ended up working with one of the largest sign industries in the country doing sign legislation type work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4745)|
| 1:19:11| And then I had my own company for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4751)|
| 1:19:13| And then I was asked to work with the International Sign Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4753)|
| 1:19:17| And one big part of what we currently do now is education for officials and planners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4757)|
| 1:19:22| The closest thing I could talk to about your area is about three, I guess it's over three years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4762)|
| 1:19:28| we did a workshop down in Memphis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4768)|
| 1:19:31| It's called Planning for Sign Code Success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4771)|
| 1:19:33| And we've done one in Huntsville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4773)|
| 1:19:37| Well, it's not too far away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4777)|
| 1:19:39| And that's the type of work that we typically do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4779)|
| 1:19:42| So a lot of the stuff we're doing is very early on in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4782)|
| 1:19:45| Usually we're not involved at the tail end of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4785)|
| 1:19:49| So that part of it is not typical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4789)|
| 1:19:51| And it's a lot easier for everyone for us to be working at the front end of the process versus the tail end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4791)|
| 1:19:58| As far as some of the things I'm going to talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4798)|
| 1:20:06| it's really some suggestions based upon have I been here before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4806)|
| 1:20:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4810)|
| 1:20:11| I haven't been here before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4811)|
| 1:20:12| Do I think this is a beautiful place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4812)|
| 1:20:13| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4813)|
| 1:20:14| I think it's beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4814)|
| 1:20:16| I haven't had a chance to drive around a lot of the community, but what I've seen is kind of breathtaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4816)|
| 1:20:20| And it's an area ñ well, I live in Arizona, so it's night and day, literally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4820)|
| 1:20:26| It's got its own beauty, too, but it's entirely different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4826)|
| 1:20:29| So I really appreciate it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4829)|
| 1:20:30| The one thing that looked like a real issue, just coming from the outside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4830)|
| 1:20:37| as someone that deals with sign regulation throughout the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4837)|
| 1:20:40| is the scheme is a good approach to look at the different types of streets in relation to size and area of signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4840)|
| 1:20:50| That's a good approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4850)|
| 1:20:51| But the one thing that when I looked at the road classification in the county and the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4851)|
| 1:20:56| in addition to the classifications listed, there's major and minor arterials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4856)|
| 1:21:04| and major and minor collectors, which aren't really recognized in the regulatory scheme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4864)|
| 1:21:10| So what I'm suggesting, which would be a major change, is to add that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4870)|
| 1:21:16| and have regulations that will work for height and area that will work specifically for those types of streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4876)|
| 1:21:26| And the other thing that I'm suggesting, too, or we're recommending, is that for the freeway signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4886)|
| 1:21:33| right now you're suggesting 35 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4893)|
| 1:21:35| At your last meeting, 35 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4895)|
| 1:21:37| And based on research, and yeah, that is paid for by the sign industry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4897)|
| 1:21:43| but I guarantee you if the sign industry didn't pay for that to be done by Penn State University,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4903)|
| 1:21:48| it would never be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4908)|
| 1:21:49| And I think the reputable folks there, we certainly don't tell them what to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4909)|
| 1:21:54| So we think it's reputable information and valuable, and we really use it because it's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4914)|
| 1:22:01| The suggestion for the freeways is just a little bit higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4921)|
| 1:22:06| because based on research and experience, too, that we know that a sign at 35 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4926)|
| 1:22:13| with traffic going 65 miles an hour to be able to be recognized, read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4933)|
| 1:22:18| and if you need to make a maneuver safely, it's going to be a real problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4938)|
| 1:22:23| We're suggesting a little additional height, which isn't much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4943)|
| 1:22:26| and it's still below what's suggested by research, only additional 5 feet, 40 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4946)|
| 1:22:31| and 300 square feet for the adjacent property and additional 30 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4951)|
| 1:22:37| which was kind of in your original recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4957)|
| 1:22:39| You have a minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4959)|
| 1:22:40| Adjacent to the interchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4960)|
| 1:22:42| I'll really speed up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4962)|
| 1:22:44| And then on the major and minor arterials, which is 20 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4964)|
| 1:22:51| we're suggesting 20 feet and 125 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4971)|
| 1:22:54| Essentially those roads are going to be just very similar to the designated federal highways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4974)|
| 1:22:59| you have in the city, which is just a handful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4979)|
| 1:23:01| There's just a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4981)|
| 1:23:03| And then we're also suggesting another classification, the major-minor collector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4983)|
| 1:23:06| at 15 feet and 100 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4986)|
| 1:23:09| These are still a little bit below what may be suggested in our research,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4989)|
| 1:23:13| but we feel it will function and it will work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4993)|
| 1:23:17| and it will provide businesses the information that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=4997)|
| 1:23:20| And that's really the bottom line with our suggestions and recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5000)|
| 1:23:23| our signs that will work and function, be able to be read, and work as intended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5003)|
| 1:23:28| and nothing more, nothing less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5008)|
| 1:23:30| Real quick, I'm not going to talk about it too much because it's so complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5010)|
| 1:23:33| Actually, your time is up, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5013)|
| 1:23:34| Did you have questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5014)|
| 1:23:36| I have one more question, if I could ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5016)|
| 1:23:39| Within the past few weeks, the Supreme Court has opined on signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5019)|
| 1:23:44| and I would guess that this opinion may well impact the sign ordinance we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5024)|
| 1:23:54| Just yes or no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5034)|
| 1:23:56| does that opinion of the Supreme Court impact the ordinance that you've looked at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5036)|
| 1:24:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5043)|
| 1:24:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5044)|
| 1:24:05| And it will impact a high percentage of every sign ordinance in the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5045)|
| 1:24:11| because it deals with content neutrality and it's very specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5051)|
| 1:24:15| And the way the code is currently drafted, there's a lot of additional exemptions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5055)|
| 1:24:19| and that's a potential problem area that suggests that your counsel look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5059)|
| 1:24:25| or your attorney look at very closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5065)|
| 1:24:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5068)|
| 1:24:29| Thank you so much for coming and sharing time this morning and then again this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5069)|
| 1:24:33| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5073)|
| 1:24:34| You're very welcome, and I appreciate the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5074)|
| 1:24:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5076)|
| 1:24:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5077)|
| 1:24:38| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5078)|
| 1:24:40| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5080)|
| 1:24:41| I think Councilman Della Vopi said that what we ought to do is go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5081)|
| 1:24:44| and start with the first part and look at the amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5084)|
| 1:24:47| I do have a number of comments to make about sign heights and temporary signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5087)|
| 1:24:51| but if we could go ahead and start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5091)|
| 1:24:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5093)|
| 1:24:54| So you all have in our packet, it's page 63 is what I'm going off of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5094)|
| 1:24:57| Is that what you all have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5097)|
| 1:25:01| So first section one is general provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5101)|
| 1:25:05| Issues there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5105)|
| 1:25:07| Councilwoman Palmer, is your light on for that or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5107)|
| 1:25:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5110)|
| 1:25:11| Section two, definitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5111)|
| 1:25:15| Mayor, I think Krista has a correction from the last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5115)|
| 1:25:19| and it's not in the document we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5119)|
| 1:25:21| but it has to do with canopy signs and cutting off the distinction of it being parallel to the wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5121)|
| 1:25:27| I think she has the text.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5127)|
| 1:25:29| Is it for page 64?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5129)|
| 1:25:31| Page 66.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5131)|
| 1:25:33| One of the definitions is canopy signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5133)|
| 1:25:36| and she has a correction to what we have in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5136)|
| 1:25:41| I do have that definition, but if I may, and I apologize, I didn't speak up a moment ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5141)|
| 1:25:48| City Council, I sent a document to City Council today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5148)|
| 1:25:51| summarizing the recommended changes that you all requested that we examine at the last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5151)|
| 1:25:59| and I also added some additional items in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5159)|
| 1:26:03| and two of those were specific to section one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5163)|
| 1:26:06| and that's a severability clause and a substitution clause,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5166)|
| 1:26:10| and those are on page five of the document that I sent to you today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5170)|
| 1:26:13| and I'm happy to pull those up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5173)|
| 1:26:16| So before we get to canopies, can we move back for a moment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5176)|
| 1:26:20| Oh, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5180)|
| 1:26:21| On page five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5181)|
| 1:26:24| Of what she sent today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5184)|
| 1:26:28| Page five of what document?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5188)|
| 1:26:33| Where it says recommendations for changes to the proposed siding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5193)|
| 1:26:37| Second reading, July 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5197)|
| 1:26:39| I don't see it on page five, I guess, is what I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5199)|
| 1:26:41| On page one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5201)|
| 1:26:45| Oh, 1.5, okay, I see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5205)|
| 1:26:46| 1.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5206)|
| 1:26:48| And there's no section, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5208)|
| 1:26:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5211)|
| 1:26:52| There's no section?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5212)|
| 1:26:53| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5213)|
| 1:26:54| So we're going back now that this is actually section one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5214)|
| 1:26:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5217)|
| 1:26:58| All of the proceeding changes were specific to a section already existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5218)|
| 1:27:01| These are based on trainings that I participated in in the past week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5221)|
| 1:27:08| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5228)|
| 1:27:09| So in section one, we have 1.1 through 1.4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5229)|
| 1:27:11| and so this would add 1.5 and 1.6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5231)|
| 1:27:15| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5235)|
| 1:27:16| So do you want to need explanation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5236)|
| 1:27:21| Council severability and substitution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5241)|
| 1:27:24| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5244)|
| 1:27:25| So the severability clause 1.5, proposed 1.5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5245)|
| 1:27:29| basically provides that if the ordinance is challenged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5249)|
| 1:27:33| it gives the court a clear message about counsel's intent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5253)|
| 1:27:37| that if any portion of the ordinance were to be found illegal or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5257)|
| 1:27:40| unconstitutional, that the remainder of the ordinance would still stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5260)|
| 1:27:44| And that's a pretty general best practice as far as signed ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5264)|
| 1:27:51| The next section, 1.6, substitution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5271)|
| 1:27:54| just gives noncommercial speech the same rights as commercial speech,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5274)|
| 1:27:58| where that commercial speech is allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5278)|
| 1:28:00| And, again, that's a best practice that's recommended for signed ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5280)|
| 1:28:04| So, again, based on trainings that Rob and I have attended in the past week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5284)|
| 1:28:10| we're making these recommendations for the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5290)|
| 1:28:17| And the trainings basically were related to the reference U.S. Supreme Court decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5297)|
| 1:28:26| So do we need a motion to have those adopted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5306)|
| 1:28:28| We need a motion to amend to add those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5308)|
| 1:28:30| I move to amend 1.5, 1.6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5310)|
| 1:28:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5313)|
| 1:28:34| Actually, to amend it to add 1.5, 1.6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5314)|
| 1:28:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5318)|
| 1:28:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5320)|
| 1:28:41| Councilman Della Vopi, are you speaking to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5321)|
| 1:28:43| I was just pointing out to what's on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5323)|
| 1:28:45| I hope everyone can see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5325)|
| 1:28:46| Your light's on, but that was because you were speaking previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5326)|
| 1:28:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5329)|
| 1:28:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5330)|
| 1:28:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5331)|
| 1:28:52| Is there any discussion about that, about adding 1.5 and 1.6 to Section 1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5332)|
| 1:28:57| No discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5337)|
| 1:28:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5338)|
| 1:28:59| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5339)|
| 1:29:00| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5340)|
| 1:29:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5341)|
| 1:29:02| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5342)|
| 1:29:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5343)|
| 1:29:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5344)|
| 1:29:05| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5345)|
| 1:29:06| Eight to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5346)|
| 1:29:07| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5347)|
| 1:29:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5348)|
| 1:29:09| So now anything else for Section 1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5349)|
| 1:29:12| So now we go on to Section 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5352)|
| 1:29:15| I was at 2.3 at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5355)|
| 1:29:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5356)|
| 1:29:17| One of her recommendations that I sort of initiated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5357)|
| 1:29:21| It shows 2.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5361)|
| 1:29:23| We need to look at 2.1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5363)|
| 1:29:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5365)|
| 1:29:26| 2.1 first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5366)|
| 1:29:27| Introduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5367)|
| 1:29:28| Oh, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5368)|
| 1:29:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5369)|
| 1:29:30| Want to talk about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5370)|
| 1:29:31| Krista?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5371)|
| 1:29:32| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5372)|
| 1:29:33| Public comments at the last meeting highlighted a phrase within the preamble to the definitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5373)|
| 1:29:39| that could become problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5379)|
| 1:29:41| You'll see in the gray stricken out text here it said except where the context clearly indicates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5381)|
| 1:29:47| a different meaning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5387)|
| 1:29:49| And the comments were that this could sort of open up a can of worms as far as interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5389)|
| 1:29:56| Words have meaning and I think we can probably convey those using the words in the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5396)|
| 1:30:00| and we don't need to argue about it otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5400)|
| 1:30:04| So our recommendation based on that discussion is to strike the language in gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5404)|
| 1:30:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5411)|
| 1:30:12| Any discussion about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5412)|
| 1:30:13| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5413)|
| 1:30:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5414)|
| 1:30:15| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5415)|
| 1:30:16| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5416)|
| 1:30:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5417)|
| 1:30:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5418)|
| 1:30:19| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5419)|
| 1:30:20| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5420)|
| 1:30:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5421)|
| 1:30:22| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5422)|
| 1:30:23| That passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5423)|
| 1:30:24| That change in wording on 2.1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5424)|
| 1:30:27| Now 2.2, definition of canopy sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5427)|
| 1:30:30| Krista?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5430)|
| 1:30:32| Hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5432)|
| 1:30:41| This was another discussion that we had at the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5441)|
| 1:30:44| I think there was a lot of potential confusion about what we're talking about as far as a display surface| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5444)|
| 1:30:52| that's parallel to the plane of the wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5452)|
| 1:30:55| So let me pull up the recommendation here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5455)|
| 1:30:59| I think it's up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5459)|
| 1:31:01| It's up there already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5461)|
| 1:31:03| So the recommendation is simply to end the sentence after the word canopy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5463)|
| 1:31:07| A canopy sign is a type of sign placed on a canopy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5467)|
| 1:31:10| which we have defined in the preceding subsection of the definitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5470)|
| 1:31:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5476)|
| 1:31:17| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5477)|
| 1:31:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5478)|
| 1:31:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5479)|
| 1:31:20| Any discussion about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5480)|
| 1:31:22| This is an amendment to Section 2.2, definition of canopy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5482)|
| 1:31:27| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5487)|
| 1:31:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5488)|
| 1:31:29| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5489)|
| 1:31:30| That passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5490)|
| 1:31:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5493)|
| 1:31:34| Section also in 2.2, definition of changeable letter reader board sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5494)|
| 1:31:43| I'll explain this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5503)|
| 1:31:44| We had some public comments about what was meant by changeable price sign versus electronic message center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5504)|
| 1:31:51| And in looking at the definition for those terms with city staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5511)|
| 1:31:59| we recognized that the changeable letter reader board sign definition did not reflect recent technologies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5519)|
| 1:32:08| that are being used by these types of signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5528)|
| 1:32:11| And I have an example to demonstrate what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5531)|
| 1:32:28| So the definition for changeable letter reader board sign typically refers to these types of signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5548)|
| 1:32:35| where the price is displayed in some static fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5555)|
| 1:32:41| But recently there's been a development in electronic scroll signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5561)|
| 1:32:46| And you can see it in the three sub-images here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5566)|
| 1:32:49| Let me see if I can zoom in for the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5569)|
| 1:32:55| Cut it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5575)|
| 1:33:02| So historically these types of signs were changed, you know, by a guy with a pole that he operated, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5582)|
| 1:33:10| took down each number individually, replaced it with a new number at the beginning of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5590)|
| 1:33:17| This technology allows businesses to change the numbers remotely through some sort of electronic means of communication with the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5597)|
| 1:33:27| It's not an electronic message center because it's not, you know, an LED or some other type of illumination conveying the price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5607)|
| 1:33:36| But it's still controlled electronically and changed electronically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5616)|
| 1:33:40| And so our definition did not reflect this type of technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5620)|
| 1:33:45| And so we're recommending a change to the definition, and I'll pull that back up, to incorporate this type of technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5625)|
| 1:33:54| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5634)|
| 1:33:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5635)|
| 1:33:56| Actually, I do want to notice on the both of these are actually section 2.3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5636)|
| 1:34:01| Isn't that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5641)|
| 1:34:03| They say section, the definition of canopy sign and this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5643)|
| 1:34:06| 2.3, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5646)|
| 1:34:07| We had said 2.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5647)|
| 1:34:09| I mean, it's written 2.2 here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5649)|
| 1:34:12| Do we need anything formal to change that or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5652)|
| 1:34:15| Just to make it clear, this is actually 2.3, both for the definition of canopy sign and changeable letter sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5655)|
| 1:34:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5663)|
| 1:34:24| So did we just have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5664)|
| 1:34:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5667)|
| 1:34:28| Okay, we have a motion and a second to approve, to change the definition as stated here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5668)|
| 1:34:36| No, we haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5676)|
| 1:34:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5677)|
| 1:34:38| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5678)|
| 1:34:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5680)|
| 1:34:41| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5681)|
| 1:34:42| That passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5682)|
| 1:34:44| Okay, now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5684)|
| 1:34:45| Okay, that section, let me just see if anything else comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5685)|
| 1:34:52| Anything else on section 2 from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5692)|
| 1:34:57| Now on section 3, prohibited signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5697)|
| 1:35:02| All right, so section 4, signs exempt from regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5702)|
| 1:35:08| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5708)|
| 1:35:09| Maybe this is the time, Chris, to tell me that we'd like to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5709)|
| 1:35:14| One thing that I want to say, and I've said this before, that the sign task force has worked on this for four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5714)|
| 1:35:20| that we realize this is not a perfect document yet, and it's one that's being worked on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5720)|
| 1:35:25| And as you can see, what we've done from the last two council meetings where we've made changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5725)|
| 1:35:29| and asked the law department to look into certain things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5729)|
| 1:35:32| there are a couple of issues that will be coming up this evening that I want to let my colleagues know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5732)|
| 1:35:38| that there needs to be further research on, further looking into the situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5738)|
| 1:35:45| and one of those has to do with a number of the signs that you'll see in this particular section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5745)|
| 1:35:49| and that has to do with temporary signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5749)|
| 1:35:51| Temporary signs, as you know, with the Supreme Court ruling that our law department is now looking into that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5751)|
| 1:35:57| to see exactly what kind of effect that will have on this particular sign ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5757)|
| 1:36:02| and it will also have an effect on temporary signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5762)|
| 1:36:05| There's a move to look at temporary signs from the standpoint of what is acceptable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5765)|
| 1:36:10| and what is not acceptable and permits and this sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5770)|
| 1:36:13| So this will be something that I will be bringing back at a future date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5773)|
| 1:36:17| and that's one issue that we will be looking at further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5777)|
| 1:36:21| The other issue that we'll be looking at, and one thing that, before I mention this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5781)|
| 1:36:26| I want to say that, as we all know, sign heights and the square footage of signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5786)|
| 1:36:31| seems to be the lightning rod of the whole ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5791)|
| 1:36:33| A lot of people are feeling that because changes are being made to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5793)|
| 1:36:37| that maybe the sign task force wasted their time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5797)|
| 1:36:40| I think you can see by what we've put together that we've spent a lot of time working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5800)|
| 1:36:46| to develop a sign ordinance that is much better than what we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5806)|
| 1:36:51| We've taken bits and pieces from all over the ordinance and put it together for the sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5811)|
| 1:36:56| I think that we need to realize and give credit to that task force that did do the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5816)|
| 1:37:02| that it's not a failure, as some folks have thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5822)|
| 1:37:06| because of the discussions that we've had over sign heights and sign faces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5826)|
| 1:37:11| So one of the things that we want to look at further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5831)|
| 1:37:15| and you've heard this discussed a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5835)|
| 1:37:17| is the possibility of really defining what other roads mean when we talk about sign heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5837)|
| 1:37:24| There has been a lot of discussion in the last week or so in terms of we've defined what federal highways are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5844)|
| 1:37:31| we know what properties adjacent to interstates are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5851)|
| 1:37:34| we know what interstates are as far as the intersections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5854)|
| 1:37:37| and there's been some concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5857)|
| 1:37:40| Brenda, in fact, that's one of the things that's been talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5860)|
| 1:37:42| the fact that what we talked is that ten-foot signs would be everywhere over the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5862)|
| 1:37:47| except for those other three designations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5867)|
| 1:37:49| So we do want to take a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5869)|
| 1:37:53| We want to look at what the city and county major road plan is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5873)|
| 1:37:58| When we look at that, we realize that there are roads that go through residential districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5878)|
| 1:38:03| that maybe do not need 15- or 20-foot signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5883)|
| 1:38:06| but there are other roads that we see that do need to be looked at from a standpoint of possibly higher signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5886)|
| 1:38:13| So we will be looking at that later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5893)|
| 1:38:15| But what the goal is, and that we hope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5895)|
| 1:38:18| is that we can go ahead and go through this sign ordinance tonight and go ahead and pass what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5898)|
| 1:38:25| It's going to be a great gift for Cindy, you know, for her four years of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5905)|
| 1:38:29| We really owe it to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5909)|
| 1:38:30| We do owe it to her, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5910)|
| 1:38:32| But, no, seriously, it is a work that's going to be a continued work in process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5912)|
| 1:38:36| and so I just want to put that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5916)|
| 1:38:38| So the temporary signs we will be talking about later also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5918)|
| 1:38:42| She said she would have preferred a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5922)|
| 1:38:47| Okay, so thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5927)|
| 1:38:49| So we're on Section 4, and Krista has a recommendation here for 4.23C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5929)|
| 1:38:59| I don't know if there's anything before 4.23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5939)|
| 1:39:03| Before we move, if we could, if we move on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5943)|
| 1:39:06| Councilman Grieve, I mean, you say you will be addressing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5946)|
| 1:39:10| You're asking us to approve what has been suggested, which obviously I'm uncomfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5950)|
| 1:39:18| So if we did that, so when's the date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5958)|
| 1:39:21| When do we actually say, well, we've got a date certain or we've got a time certain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5961)|
| 1:39:26| Because I would say there's a certain amount of people in this audience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5966)|
| 1:39:29| who would be uncomfortable with saying let's go ahead and pass it and we'll come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5969)|
| 1:39:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5972)|
| 1:39:33| No, I think that as we go through this and we look at those particular issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5973)|
| 1:39:36| that we think need to have further study, we'll put a time limit on it at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5976)|
| 1:39:41| Yeah, I don't intend to have this go on forever on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5981)|
| 1:39:45| But I do think that, for instance, the Supreme Court ruling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5985)|
| 1:39:49| and the understanding by the law department of what that means,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5989)|
| 1:39:51| I think we need to get input from them in terms of how long that's going to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5991)|
| 1:39:55| And then the same thing has to do with really checking out to see what it means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=5995)|
| 1:40:00| to have these different roads and these road classifications on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6000)|
| 1:40:04| So I'm thinking a couple of, you know, 8, 12, 12 weeks, something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6004)|
| 1:40:08| we need to get that input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6008)|
| 1:40:10| But, no, I intend to have a time limit put on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6010)|
| 1:40:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6012)|
| 1:40:14| I do want to add that those changes would have to go to MPC first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6014)|
| 1:40:20| That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6020)|
| 1:40:22| We would be amending the zoning code as it stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6022)|
| 1:40:25| And so that would have to go to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6025)|
| 1:40:26| and their schedule works a bit further out than ours does since they meet monthly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6026)|
| 1:40:30| And so I just want to inject that into the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6030)|
| 1:40:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6034)|
| 1:40:35| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6035)|
| 1:40:37| So if I understand correctly, we're being asked to approve something tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6037)|
| 1:40:43| that we don't know what will look like in its final document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6043)|
| 1:40:47| Is my understanding correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6047)|
| 1:40:51| What I'm asking you to do is to approve the document tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6051)|
| 1:40:55| and that we will highlight those several areas that we're going to be looking into further on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6055)|
| 1:41:01| so that we will at least have a document that will then be amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6061)|
| 1:41:06| It's like any of the other ordinances that we have that can always be amended at any time on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6066)|
| 1:41:12| I am really uncomfortable about supporting an ordinance tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6072)|
| 1:41:19| This has been a work in progress for most of our lives on council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6079)|
| 1:41:24| and some of us will be gone and others will be continuing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6084)|
| 1:41:30| And it is never done, but I'm just really very uncomfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6090)|
| 1:41:34| and unwilling to vote for the heights, for example, that we now have in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6094)|
| 1:41:41| I need to know, I need to see what they're going to be in order to protect my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6101)|
| 1:41:45| the businesses, the owners who are my constituents, the people who live in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6105)|
| 1:41:51| So I just wanted to say that I'm very, very uncomfortable with voting on something tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6111)|
| 1:41:57| that we really don't know what it's going to look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6117)|
| 1:42:00| because in 12 weeks it may look one way that you envision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6120)|
| 1:42:04| and it may look totally different by the time it goes through all the processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6124)|
| 1:42:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6130)|
| 1:42:12| Councilman Dela Voce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6132)|
| 1:42:15| I think Duane got ahead of himself there in terms of introducing the sign height| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6135)|
| 1:42:20| and areas that we will address later in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6140)|
| 1:42:23| With regard to both Section 4 and 5 where they have temporary signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6143)|
| 1:42:28| one of the things that I understand the legal department is going to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6148)|
| 1:42:32| is how to simplify this so we don't start parsing the kind of information on temporary signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6152)|
| 1:42:40| It has been forever the case in our country's litigation history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6160)|
| 1:42:46| that speech is protected under the First Amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6166)|
| 1:42:50| and when you start giving priority to one kind of speech and not to another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6170)|
| 1:42:56| you start to get either up against or crossing that line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6176)|
| 1:43:00| And so you have to have a fair amount of leeway in terms of what is allowed to be said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6180)|
| 1:43:07| In treating it the same, I think the rule is something like you have to use the least restrictive means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6187)|
| 1:43:13| that you can when you regulate speech of that type,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6193)|
| 1:43:17| especially when you're dealing with the content of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6197)|
| 1:43:20| whether it's commercial or political or something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6200)|
| 1:43:23| So one of the recommendations that I heard Mr. Carpentier say earlier today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6203)|
| 1:43:28| that some places are moving towards sort of a more compact idea of temporary signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6208)|
| 1:43:36| that have certain height and area restrictions rather than trying to parse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6216)|
| 1:43:41| whether you're talking about real estate or politics or some speech content.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6221)|
| 1:43:46| That thing is something I think the legal department can sort through as they study the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6226)|
| 1:43:51| On the other, I think we need to just wait until we get to that section and talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6231)|
| 1:43:55| There's certainly been a point made maybe other signs is too broad a category to dump everything else into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6235)|
| 1:44:02| but I think we ought to wait until we get to Section 8 to start parsing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6242)|
| 1:44:08| Councilman Grave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6248)|
| 1:44:09| That was my intention, Mr. Delvopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6249)|
| 1:44:12| I was just saying that there are certain issues that we are going to be bringing up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6252)|
| 1:44:15| but I didn't mean to discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6255)|
| 1:44:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6258)|
| 1:44:19| Okay, so I think I'm still on Section 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6259)|
| 1:44:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6262)|
| 1:44:23| And is there anything there is, Chris, to prepare something on 4.23C based on some public comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6263)|
| 1:44:31| Yes, and this is pretty much just kind of wordsmithing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6271)|
| 1:44:37| but obviously that's Council's prerogative to vote upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6277)|
| 1:44:42| But it was just adding the words additional to clarify how many signs you get per acre beyond one acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6282)|
| 1:44:51| And this is in regards to signs like no trespassing, dangerous animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6291)|
| 1:44:56| So basically the bigger lot size you have, the more signs that you can have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6296)|
| 1:45:00| And it really is just adding terms to clarify the regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6300)|
| 1:45:04| Move to approve the change to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6304)|
| 1:45:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6308)|
| 1:45:09| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6309)|
| 1:45:11| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6311)|
| 1:45:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6312)|
| 1:45:13| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6313)|
| 1:45:14| Okay, that is amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6314)|
| 1:45:18| Okay, anything else on Section 4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6318)|
| 1:45:22| Section 5, signs exempt from permit requirements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6322)|
| 1:45:29| It has that same question of temporary that they will address, I think, so probably have nothing for tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6329)|
| 1:45:35| Okay, Section 6, criteria for measurement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6335)|
| 1:45:41| Can I just add from perspective of the Law Department with regard to the Reid case that was recently decided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6341)|
| 1:45:51| not every city in the United States our size or bigger has been working for the past four years in revising their sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6351)|
| 1:46:02| But every city in the United States our size or bigger is working on interpreting Reid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6362)|
| 1:46:09| and figuring out what it means to their sign ordinance and how it's going to impact their sign ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6369)|
| 1:46:15| and how to not regulate content contrary to the Reid decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6375)|
| 1:46:21| And I know that Krista Cuccaro and Rob Frost, even this past week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6381)|
| 1:46:27| attended a seminar that was conducted by the International Municipal Law Officers Organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6387)|
| 1:46:33| and they're going to need to study some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6393)|
| 1:46:36| It's a very complex opinion, and there are a lot of complex issues associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6396)|
| 1:46:42| And until we have that completely under control, or at least until we feel like we have it under control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6402)|
| 1:46:49| it would be premature to come to you tonight and say, here's the fix for this ordinance under Reid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6409)|
| 1:46:56| We just can't do that until we all work together as municipalities and as lawyers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6416)|
| 1:47:02| to figure out exactly the impact of Reid and how we're going to treat that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6422)|
| 1:47:08| and come up with an ordinance that will meet constitutional muster under Reid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6428)|
| 1:47:12| And we're going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6432)|
| 1:47:14| We're working on that already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6434)|
| 1:47:15| We will be working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6435)|
| 1:47:17| And when we feel comfortable with an understanding of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6437)|
| 1:47:21| we will come back to you as soon as we've got that understanding with either a proposed change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6441)|
| 1:47:28| or to say to you, we think we're okay under Reid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6448)|
| 1:47:31| I suspect the former rather than the latter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6451)|
| 1:47:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6455)|
| 1:47:36| Thank you, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6456)|
| 1:47:38| Anything for Section 6, criteria for measurement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6458)|
| 1:47:43| Now on Section 7, general sign standards and requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6463)|
| 1:47:48| I think Krista has one on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6468)|
| 1:47:49| Krista has 7.6, the covering of posts, poles, uprights, and braces on detached signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6469)|
| 1:47:57| At the last meeting, I believe there was a discussion about what precisely we're talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6477)|
| 1:48:04| And I was at one of the sign task force meetings when this came up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6484)|
| 1:48:07| and I think the intent, and I think Councilman Grieve talked about this at the last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6487)|
| 1:48:12| where you have the round poles and the preference of the task force was to have square poles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6492)|
| 1:48:23| or some sort of shroud covering the round component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6503)|
| 1:48:28| But as our discussion happened at the last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6508)|
| 1:48:32| I think there needed to be a little bit more clarification as to what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6512)|
| 1:48:38| And so attempting to get at the intent of this section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6518)|
| 1:48:45| I've suggested the changes that you'll see on the screen and in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6525)|
| 1:48:52| And I'll read it because it's a little bit lengthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6532)|
| 1:48:55| It says, all round posts, poles, uprights, braces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6535)|
| 1:48:58| or other supporting structures that are part of a detached sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6538)|
| 1:49:02| shall be constructed, covered, or finished in a shape that is not round| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6542)|
| 1:49:06| and that obscures the round posts from public view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6546)|
| 1:49:09| Provided, however, that this covering requirement shall not apply to billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6549)|
| 1:49:13| or signs in a floodway as determined by the Department of Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6553)|
| 1:49:17| And I believe that was part of the conversation as well at the last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6557)|
| 1:49:20| that we did not intend for this to apply to billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6560)|
| 1:49:24| because those are pretty significant poles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6564)|
| 1:49:27| And then in discussions with city staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6567)|
| 1:49:30| it came to light that they actually prefer round poles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6570)|
| 1:49:34| because in the event of a flood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6574)|
| 1:49:36| debris floats better around round things than square things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6576)|
| 1:49:41| So this is the recommendation for Council's consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6581)|
| 1:49:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6586)|
| 1:49:48| Councilman Dalivopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6588)|
| 1:49:49| Yeah, I'm ready to move to approve it as a technical change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6589)|
| 1:49:52| I have never understood why we like square poles better than round poles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6592)|
| 1:49:56| but I'll leave that to the aesthetic folks that made that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6596)|
| 1:50:00| But the fix is a good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6600)|
| 1:50:01| We don't want to exacerbate a flood condition, so I'll move to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6601)|
| 1:50:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6605)|
| 1:50:06| Any more discussion on that 7.6?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6606)|
| 1:50:09| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6609)|
| 1:50:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6610)|
| 1:50:11| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6611)|
| 1:50:12| That passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6612)|
| 1:50:14| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6614)|
| 1:50:15| Okay, that's Section 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6615)|
| 1:50:16| Section 8, standards for specific sign types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6616)|
| 1:50:20| We've got one here that Chris has prepared on 8.6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6620)|
| 1:50:23| Anything before that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6623)|
| 1:50:26| And there's a typo in 8.6 that needs to be corrected or we're going to have problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6626)|
| 1:50:30| Yeah, I'll go ahead and bring that up now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6630)|
| 1:50:33| This is related to the conversation at the last meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6633)|
| 1:50:37| where I think there was an inadvertent omission related to EMCs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6637)|
| 1:50:42| where the intent was to continue to allow them only in commercial and industrial districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6642)|
| 1:50:47| And here I accidentally put the word office instead of industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6647)|
| 1:50:53| so I'm going to go ahead and change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6653)|
| 1:50:59| But this change here reflects what council's intent was as far as limiting these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6659)|
| 1:51:06| to those districts that they were already limited to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6666)|
| 1:51:09| There's an additional change in A3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6669)|
| 1:51:15| and it was discussed at the last meeting that the regulations in A3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6675)|
| 1:51:21| that were related to districts with design regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6681)|
| 1:51:26| or guidelines approved by some sort of regulatory body was potentially confusing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6686)|
| 1:51:33| and maybe broader than council would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6693)|
| 1:51:37| So based on that conversation, the recommendation is to strike that language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6697)|
| 1:51:42| and so this is for council's consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6702)|
| 1:51:47| Move to approve with the corrections you just made on the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6707)|
| 1:51:52| I would add one question for Krista.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6712)|
| 1:51:55| Somewhere I saw documentation, and given the hour, I don't remember where,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6715)|
| 1:51:59| where we were using the wrong standard for the brightness that's below that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6719)|
| 1:52:05| but certainly not under 8.6A, whatever that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6725)|
| 1:52:10| That's further down, so I just move that we approve the technical changes in 8.6A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6730)|
| 1:52:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6737)|
| 1:52:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6738)|
| 1:52:20| Are you moving what is on here, the changes in red and the strikeouts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6740)|
| 1:52:25| In red plus the correction, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6745)|
| 1:52:26| Right. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6746)|
| 1:52:28| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6748)|
| 1:52:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6749)|
| 1:52:30| I would just like to add that number four then becomes number three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6750)|
| 1:52:33| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6753)|
| 1:52:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6754)|
| 1:52:35| Right. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6755)|
| 1:52:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6756)|
| 1:52:37| Then on that same section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6757)|
| 1:52:38| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6758)|
| 1:52:39| Let's go ahead and vote on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6759)|
| 1:52:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6761)|
| 1:52:42| So that's 8.6A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6762)|
| 1:52:45| 8.6 is basically, and then A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6765)|
| 1:52:48| A, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6768)|
| 1:52:49| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6769)|
| 1:52:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6770)|
| 1:52:51| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6771)|
| 1:52:53| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6773)|
| 1:52:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6774)|
| 1:52:55| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6775)|
| 1:52:56| That passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6776)|
| 1:52:59| You have another section, 8.7?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6779)|
| 1:53:02| Well, 8.6H, I'm just going to ask the people that know this stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6782)|
| 1:53:07| to take a look, but there was an exchange of information somewhere that said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6787)|
| 1:53:13| that the brightness standard of 750 nits or the daytime brightness of 3,000 nits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6793)|
| 1:53:20| and I don't know a nit if it hit me in the head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6800)|
| 1:53:24| were I guess higher than some current industry standard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6804)|
| 1:53:29| and I don't know where I saw that notice at this hour of the evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6809)|
| 1:53:33| but maybe someone can just look at that number in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6813)|
| 1:53:38| and we'll have a correction possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6818)|
| 1:53:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6823)|
| 1:53:44| Is that it on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6824)|
| 1:53:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6827)|
| 1:53:48| We're on 8.7, changeable price signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6828)|
| 1:53:54| Chris, do you want to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6834)|
| 1:53:55| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6835)|
| 1:53:58| This was, again, based on public comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6838)|
| 1:54:01| It was unclear, perhaps based on the sentence that's in gray| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6841)|
| 1:54:06| at the very outset of the section that's stricken out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6846)|
| 1:54:11| whether A through D applied to static changeable price signs in addition to EMCs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6851)|
| 1:54:18| or if it only applied to EMCs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6858)|
| 1:54:21| and I think the intent is for them to apply to all changeable price signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6861)|
| 1:54:26| and so the recommendation is to strike that introductory sentence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6866)|
| 1:54:31| so that we're just referring to changeable price signs as they've been defined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6871)|
| 1:54:37| and just to specify here that any EMC that is a changeable price sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6877)|
| 1:54:44| is also subject to any regulations in 8.6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6884)|
| 1:54:49| the preceding section that is all about EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6889)|
| 1:54:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6893)|
| 1:54:54| That's 8.7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6894)|
| 1:54:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6896)|
| 1:54:57| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6897)|
| 1:54:58| This is on 8.7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6898)|
| 1:55:01| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6901)|
| 1:55:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6902)|
| 1:55:03| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6903)|
| 1:55:04| That passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6904)|
| 1:55:06| The amendment passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6906)|
| 1:55:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6908)|
| 1:55:09| Now section 9, master sign plans for unified developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6909)|
| 1:55:15| Anything there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6915)|
| 1:55:18| Section 10, signs permitted in all districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6918)|
| 1:55:25| Section 11, signs permitted in specific districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6925)|
| 1:55:29| and this is where Krista has 11.6.C for commercial and industrial zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6929)|
| 1:55:40| This is where there will be a lot of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6940)|
| 1:55:43| Who wants to start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6943)|
| 1:55:44| I'll go ahead and explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6944)|
| 1:55:48| So in the proposed version, let me pull it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6948)|
| 1:55:53| we have several different roadway classifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6953)|
| 1:55:57| We have interstate, used as a term, interstate interchange,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6957)|
| 1:56:04| federally designated highways, and in looking at enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6964)|
| 1:56:12| I think it's important to define what these terms mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6972)|
| 1:56:15| and to clarify which roadways we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6975)|
| 1:56:18| So in doing that, city staff did some research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6978)|
| 1:56:22| as far as what these might be referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6982)|
| 1:56:28| And in the document that I provided to you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6988)|
| 1:56:30| I think there's a couple areas for additional clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6990)|
| 1:56:33| based on how council wants to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6993)|
| 1:56:37| But I'll go ahead and summarize what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=6997)|
| 1:56:43| So we have interstates, and these are defined in MPC's major road plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7003)|
| 1:56:50| And they include I-40, Pellissippi Parkway south of its intersection with I-40,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7010)|
| 1:56:56| I-40, I-75, I-640, and I-275.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7016)|
| 1:57:02| The recommendation is to use the definition that's used in MPC's major road plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7022)|
| 1:57:08| which is that an interstate is a divided highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7028)|
| 1:57:11| designated under the interstate highway system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7031)|
| 1:57:14| designed for the safe, unimpeded movement of large volumes of through traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7034)|
| 1:57:19| with full access control and grade separation at intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7039)|
| 1:57:24| So that definition, if adopted by council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7044)|
| 1:57:27| would be relevant to the first two classifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7047)|
| 1:57:33| I'll move to approve that, just clarifying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7053)|
| 1:57:39| We're talking interstate at this point and not the federally designated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7059)|
| 1:57:42| So you want to just vote on them individually?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7062)|
| 1:57:47| Do we have to make a choice on one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7067)|
| 1:57:49| Yeah, there was options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7069)|
| 1:57:52| We'll see if we can just get one vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7072)|
| 1:57:56| That will divide it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7076)|
| 1:57:58| Okay, I'll go ahead and explain interstate interchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7078)|
| 1:58:04| Interstate interchange is, I think, a relatively broad term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7084)|
| 1:58:08| and it had been originally used at the sign task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7088)|
| 1:58:12| and limited to six specific interchanges within the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7092)|
| 1:58:19| Considering the term, generally there are two types of interchanges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7099)|
| 1:58:24| something I did not know until very recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7104)|
| 1:58:27| There's service interchanges, which are interchanges that connect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7107)|
| 1:58:31| an interstate to lesser facilities, non-interstates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7111)|
| 1:58:35| such as arterials or collector roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7115)|
| 1:58:39| And then we have interchanges that are referred to as system interchanges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7119)|
| 1:58:44| that connect interstates to other interstates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7124)|
| 1:58:48| So in using the term interchange here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7128)|
| 1:58:51| I think council will need to clarify which type of interchange it prefers or both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7131)|
| 1:59:01| And so in the definition, I've incorporated both,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7141)|
| 1:59:05| but again city council will need to, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7145)|
| 1:59:08| consider whether it wants to use system interchanges or service interchanges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7148)|
| 1:59:13| But the definition that I've provided is an interstate interchange| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7153)|
| 1:59:18| is an interchange that connects an interstate to another interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7158)|
| 1:59:21| or to a lesser facility, such as a federally designated highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7161)|
| 1:59:25| or an arterial or collector street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7165)|
| 1:59:31| And then finally, moving on to federally designated highways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7171)|
| 1:59:37| I looked at other jurisdictions, and unfortunately that was not of much use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7177)|
| 1:59:43| because the jurisdictions that I found that use this term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7183)|
| 1:59:47| which were very few, and I'm not sure where this term originates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7187)|
| 1:59:52| but those jurisdictions use this term to basically define| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7192)|
| 1:59:57| what we have already sort of spoken about here as interstates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7197)|
| 2:00:01| They were referring to the highways that go between states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7201)|
| 2:00:06| And so I figured we probably did not want to define the category at the top| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7206)|
| 2:00:13| of the category in the third row as the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7213)|
| 2:00:17| And so my recommendation after looking at this and researching it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7217)|
| 2:00:24| is that federally designated highways would refer to the United States| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7224)|
| 2:00:28| numbered highways, which are an integrated network of roads and highways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7228)|
| 2:00:32| in the United States with route numbers and locations coordinated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7232)|
| 2:00:35| by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7235)|
| 2:00:39| In Knoxville, this would include U.S. 441, which is Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7239)|
| 2:00:43| Broadway, Henley, U.S. 129, which is Alcoa Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7243)|
| 2:00:49| and U.S. 170-1125, which is Magnolia, Asheville Highway, Rutledge Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7249)|
| 2:00:58| and I think it might be a couple more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7258)|
| 2:01:00| And I have a map that illustrates these that was prepared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7260)|
| 2:01:04| by the Transportation Planning Organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7264)|
| 2:01:07| You also have a table, which is really handy, and you should incorporate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7267)|
| 2:01:11| into the text as the illustration of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7271)|
| 2:01:14| It seems to me that that's clearer to read than a lot of text about AASHTO| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7274)|
| 2:01:19| that no one knows what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7279)|
| 2:01:21| You're referring to this map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7281)|
| 2:01:23| Except in a courtroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7283)|
| 2:01:25| You're referring to this map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7285)|
| 2:01:26| There's a table that's right above the map in Exhibit B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7286)|
| 2:01:29| I think that's really handy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7289)|
| 2:01:32| On this map here, the red roads are what would be under the recommended definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7292)|
| 2:01:42| would be federally designated highways, and then the blue routes are interstates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7302)|
| 2:01:48| And would you show the table, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7308)|
| 2:01:50| I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7310)|
| 2:01:52| Because that's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7312)|
| 2:01:53| It actually spells it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7313)|
| 2:01:56| And I was informed additionally by the Transportation Planning Organization today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7316)|
| 2:02:01| that a portion of Cumberland is being, jurisdiction for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7321)|
| 2:02:06| is being transferred to the local government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7326)|
| 2:02:10| And so 70 at that portion would not be included on this map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7330)|
| 2:02:17| That's the Ann Wallace exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7337)|
| 2:02:20| So this is a lot of information for council's consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7340)|
| 2:02:26| And I think the easiest definition perhaps to tackle first would be interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7346)|
| 2:02:32| because that's rather clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7352)|
| 2:02:34| And then we have interstate interchange, which council, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7354)|
| 2:02:36| will need to decide whether you all are talking about system interchanges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7356)|
| 2:02:39| that connect only interstates to interstates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7359)|
| 2:02:42| or service interchanges which connect interstate to a lesser facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7362)|
| 2:02:47| Or both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7367)|
| 2:02:49| And then there's federally designated highways, which the city is recommending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7369)|
| 2:02:55| we use the U.S. routes to define those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7375)|
| 2:03:01| Is that the second bullet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7381)|
| 2:03:04| I'm sorry, what was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7384)|
| 2:03:06| Under federally designated highway options in red, it said two options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7386)|
| 2:03:13| So, yes, that would be the second one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7393)|
| 2:03:16| So you recommend the second bullet on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7396)|
| 2:03:19| Mayor, if I could address the other aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7399)|
| 2:03:22| It just seems to me that we have no jurisdiction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7402)|
| 2:03:24| over interstate connections to other interstates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7404)|
| 2:03:27| That's a federal interstate with its own signage system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7407)|
| 2:03:30| And so we're talking about interstate leaving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7410)|
| 2:03:34| interchange that leaves to a local road, whatever its classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7414)|
| 2:03:39| And that seems to me to be the better choice here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7419)|
| 2:03:42| We're not going to tell the federal government how to regulate signage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7422)|
| 2:03:46| going from I-640 to I-75 or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7426)|
| 2:03:51| Councilman Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7431)|
| 2:03:52| Well, I was just going to say the intent of the signed task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7432)|
| 2:03:54| would be the service intersections is what we were referring to on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7434)|
| 2:04:00| To local roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7440)|
| 2:04:01| Yes, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7441)|
| 2:04:03| In red here, it would basically say an interstate interchange| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7443)|
| 2:04:08| is an interchange that connects an interstate to a lesser facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7448)|
| 2:04:15| such as a federally designated highway or an arterial or collector street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7455)|
| 2:04:18| Is that what it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7458)|
| 2:04:19| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7459)|
| 2:04:20| So we're at second bullet in red at the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7460)|
| 2:04:34| It would say interstate interchange is an interchange that, or colon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7474)|
| 2:04:41| an interchange that connects to a lesser facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7481)|
| 2:04:45| such as a federally designated highway or an arterial or collector street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7485)|
| 2:04:51| That's what we're recommending?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7491)|
| 2:04:53| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7493)|
| 2:04:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7494)|
| 2:04:55| So you're fine with the first bullet, the interstate definition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7495)|
| 2:04:59| I mean, that's being proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7499)|
| 2:05:03| Interstate is a divided highway designated under the interstate highway system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7503)|
| 2:05:07| designed for the safe, unimpeded movement of large volumes of through traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7507)|
| 2:05:12| with full access control and grade separation at intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7512)|
| 2:05:16| And then the interstate interchange, I just said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7516)|
| 2:05:22| And then under federally designated highways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7522)|
| 2:05:25| what Chris is recommending is the second bullet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7525)|
| 2:05:29| which is those highways that are U.S. numbered highways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7529)|
| 2:05:33| an integrated network of roads and highways in the U.S. with route numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7533)|
| 2:05:38| and locations coordinated by the American Association of State Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7538)|
| 2:05:42| and Transportation Officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7542)|
| 2:05:44| And to that I'm adding the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7544)|
| 2:05:45| Is that correct, Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7545)|
| 2:05:46| Is that where we are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7546)|
| 2:05:47| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7547)|
| 2:05:48| If the council so chooses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7548)|
| 2:05:50| And we'd like to add the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7550)|
| 2:05:51| The list and maybe the map just as a clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7551)|
| 2:05:54| If I may, I think we may not want to have the list within the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7554)|
| 2:06:00| because it can change from time to time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7560)|
| 2:06:02| demonstrated with the removal of Cumberland from the state's jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7562)|
| 2:06:08| So I think that might be MPC's preference as well if they want to weigh in on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7568)|
| 2:06:19| MPC, do you want to weigh in on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7579)|
| 2:06:21| Throwing up a white flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7581)|
| 2:06:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7582)|
| 2:06:25| Just as Chris just said, Dan Kelly with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7585)|
| 2:06:28| Just as Chris has said, you may be re-designated streets in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7588)|
| 2:06:33| Cumberland Avenue is just the most recent example, the re-designation of Neyland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7593)|
| 2:06:38| I think when you put it in the ordinance like that, you have a static list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7598)|
| 2:06:42| If you want to put it in the ordinance, you need to have some kind of disclaimer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7602)|
| 2:06:46| that would suggest that there could be future changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7606)|
| 2:06:49| at some point where you wouldn't necessarily have to amend the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7609)|
| 2:06:54| in order to include that road under the signed regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7614)|
| 2:07:01| Which does council want to do on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7621)|
| 2:07:04| Include it with a disclaimer or not include it at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7624)|
| 2:07:08| Not include it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7628)|
| 2:07:10| Include it by reference so it's not in the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7630)|
| 2:07:13| so you can change that reference, can't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7633)|
| 2:07:17| Where are you going to find the table when it was made up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7637)|
| 2:07:21| I think Charles did his best just to leave it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7641)|
| 2:07:24| I think it's really probably better for the future as we move along and adapt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7644)|
| 2:07:31| to not have either the chart or the map there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7651)|
| 2:07:36| And if people have questions about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7656)|
| 2:07:39| we will be able to demonstrate by going to the record of this meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7659)|
| 2:07:43| and showing the chart and the map that we had at that meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7663)|
| 2:07:49| as legislative history if it comes to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7669)|
| 2:07:52| But if you include it in the ordinance, then you've sort of confined yourself to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7672)|
| 2:07:57| So we can make them a part of the legislative history of what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7677)|
| 2:08:01| This is what we're talking about, and it's illustrative of what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7681)|
| 2:08:05| But we don't want to confine it just to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7685)|
| 2:08:07| because it's going to be a living, breathing, moving thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7687)|
| 2:08:11| Your other option, I guess, would be to have a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7691)|
| 2:08:13| The special said we can attach it to the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7693)|
| 2:08:15| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7695)|
| 2:08:17| Your other option would be to have a footnote that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7697)|
| 2:08:19| this is illustrated that as of a certain date, it looks like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7699)|
| 2:08:22| but it's an ever-changing thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7702)|
| 2:08:24| But that's fine. Put it in the minutes. That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7704)|
| 2:08:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7706)|
| 2:08:28| I move we accept the changes that we've made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7708)|
| 2:08:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7711)|
| 2:08:33| Okay, any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7713)|
| 2:08:35| Everybody know what we're voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7715)|
| 2:08:37| Mayor, may I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7717)|
| 2:08:39| Councilman? Councilwoman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7719)|
| 2:08:41| Did you want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7721)|
| 2:08:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7723)|
| 2:08:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7724)|
| 2:08:45| Oh, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7725)|
| 2:08:46| We'll get back to you, Krista.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7726)|
| 2:08:49| Well, then, this is all inclusive of this table, the footage, the signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7729)|
| 2:08:57| Which table are you talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7737)|
| 2:08:58| The maximum liable sign height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7738)|
| 2:09:01| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7741)|
| 2:09:02| No, we're talking just about these definitions right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7742)|
| 2:09:04| Just the definitions right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7744)|
| 2:09:06| On interstate, interstate interchange, and federally designated highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7746)|
| 2:09:10| Krista, did you want to add something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7750)|
| 2:09:13| Yeah, for a point of clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7753)|
| 2:09:17| my recommendation would be to add these definitions within Section 2.2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7757)|
| 2:09:21| which is where the other definitions related to signs are housed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7761)|
| 2:09:26| So Section 2.2 of the sign code, not within 11.6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7766)|
| 2:09:31| but move it back with the other definitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7771)|
| 2:09:34| Add to Section 2.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7774)|
| 2:09:39| So they're just alphabetical insertions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7779)|
| 2:09:41| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7781)|
| 2:09:43| Okay, so the motion is to add these definitions, as we've just stated, to Section 2.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7783)|
| 2:09:49| That's the amended motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7789)|
| 2:09:53| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7793)|
| 2:09:55| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7795)|
| 2:09:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7796)|
| 2:09:57| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7797)|
| 2:09:58| That passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7798)|
| 2:10:00| Okay, let's see where we are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7800)|
| 2:10:07| Okay, now we get to sign height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7807)|
| 2:10:11| Everyone's favorite seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7811)|
| 2:10:12| Yes, we're going to take a five-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7812)|
| 2:10:21| All right, we are on 11.6C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7821)|
| 2:10:26| Well, 11.6C, right, sign height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7826)|
| 2:10:29| Who would like to start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7829)|
| 2:10:30| I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7830)|
| 2:10:32| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7832)|
| 2:10:33| This has probably been the most contentious issue we have had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7833)|
| 2:10:37| and I'm sure everyone here has had dozens, if not hundreds, of e-mails, phone calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7837)|
| 2:10:44| sidebar conversations with citizens of every stripe, whether it's commercial, business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7844)|
| 2:10:50| whether it's aesthetic only, whether it's some combination of that, on what's the proper sign height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7850)|
| 2:10:57| And, I mean, at some point we have to cut through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7857)|
| 2:11:00| There's been discussion about if we change the numbers, are we dissing the task force effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7860)|
| 2:11:08| or are we trying to look ahead at where our city is going to be the next 20 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7868)|
| 2:11:14| as signs slowly change over and come under the new sign ordinance and old signs fade away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7874)|
| 2:11:21| The one thing I've heard, well, maybe two things I've heard that give me pause on saying let's approve it as written| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7881)|
| 2:11:28| is there's something to be said about not drawing the line on just federal designated highways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7888)|
| 2:11:35| There are certainly major arterials like up in Clinton Highway, I guess not the highway itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7895)|
| 2:11:44| but Merchant's Road that comes in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7904)|
| 2:11:46| It's nothing but a business district, and I suspect the traffic speed there is at least 40 miles an hour and maybe higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7906)|
| 2:11:54| I don't know whether, what is Merchant's Drive, do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7914)|
| 2:11:57| Thirty-five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7917)|
| 2:11:58| Thirty-five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7918)|
| 2:11:59| It's still an area that lives on its signs, and we have it caught in limbo between the 20 and the 10 footer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7919)|
| 2:12:06| I mean, I don't know whether anyone has the stomach for adding a fifth category| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7926)|
| 2:12:12| or whether we should have arterial roads being like 15 feet or some other number, 20 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7932)|
| 2:12:18| but we have to decide whether we're going to restrict places where there is significant mercantile activity to the 10 foot sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7938)|
| 2:12:31| Speed's an important factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7951)|
| 2:12:33| I don't know whether we'd prefer to talk about roads that have a speed limit of X or higher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7953)|
| 2:12:38| but one of the things we talked about from the very beginning was the faster the vehicle moves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7958)|
| 2:12:43| the less likely you can absorb the information, the more likely you need a slightly larger sign, whatever that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7963)|
| 2:12:50| We could add a phrase after federally designated highways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7970)|
| 2:12:55| We could add a separate category, major arterials, and say 15 feet, or we could leave it at is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7975)|
| 2:13:00| One of the things I'm going to recommend later as we get to the end of this is to have a requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7980)|
| 2:13:06| that the building official report back no later than six months with a report on problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7986)|
| 2:13:15| and changes that are needed to the ordinance because maybe it's never done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7995)|
| 2:13:19| but I think we ought to have some deadline where we have some experience and find out where the bumps are in the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=7999)|
| 2:13:24| But I guess I would like to see us either approve this chart as is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8004)|
| 2:13:28| or add a category for major roads that are major commercial roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8008)|
| 2:13:33| whether you call those major arterials or something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8013)|
| 2:13:36| If you look at MPC's road plan, I mean, every road in the city is in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8016)|
| 2:13:44| and some of them are roads that go through neighborhoods that have nothing to do with commercial activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8024)|
| 2:13:50| and we certainly don't want to be, I think, getting into an area where we have regulation where it doesn't make any sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8030)|
| 2:14:02| But if we are leaving out major commercial corridors, I think maybe that have a reasonable speed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8042)|
| 2:14:10| I mean, not 25, not 30, but a higher speed, we may want to have some relief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8050)|
| 2:14:15| and that's the only thing I think we need to look at at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8055)|
| 2:14:19| recognizing we're going to come back again and again to these issues as we confront problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8059)|
| 2:14:24| That's my thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8064)|
| 2:14:26| Councilman Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8066)|
| 2:14:27| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8067)|
| 2:14:29| Councilman Dela Vokey, that's what I was referring to when you said that I was kind of jumping the gun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8069)|
| 2:14:34| I just wanted to let you know that there were certain items that I think that we still want to look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8074)|
| 2:14:38| and that was one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8078)|
| 2:14:40| In fact, one of the thoughts were that maybe what we do is go ahead with item number three there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8080)|
| 2:14:46| property fronting on federally designated highways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8086)|
| 2:14:48| and refer back to the major road plan that both the city of Knoxville and Knox County have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8088)|
| 2:14:54| However, when you go through this and look at the major arterial roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8094)|
| 2:14:57| they're not necessarily the roads that we may want to have 20-foot signs on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8097)|
| 2:15:02| such as Adair Drive, which is really all residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8102)|
| 2:15:05| So one of the thoughts were that, like you say, we can either add that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8105)|
| 2:15:09| or the possibility of having another category,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8109)|
| 2:15:12| but I think that what we need to do is we need to ask MPC and possibly our folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8112)|
| 2:15:18| to take a look at those roads that we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8118)|
| 2:15:22| and have those defined as a separate category,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8122)|
| 2:15:26| whether it be tied into the federal designated highways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8126)|
| 2:15:31| or whether it be a separate category itself, which it might be 15 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8131)|
| 2:15:35| I think after the last council meeting, I think there was some heartburn over the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8135)|
| 2:15:39| that we just had not defined what all of the roadway classifications might be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8139)|
| 2:15:44| in terms of the certain heights there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8144)|
| 2:15:47| So that was one of the areas, along with the temporary signs that I was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8147)|
| 2:15:52| that I think we need to have further research on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8152)|
| 2:15:57| What do we do in the interim? That's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8157)|
| 2:15:59| Do we approve the chart tonight and then work on the issue as an amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8159)|
| 2:16:04| or do we try to address it and let MPC give us further guidance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8164)|
| 2:16:10| That's really the nub of the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8170)|
| 2:16:14| I think, of course, the pleasure of council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8174)|
| 2:16:17| but I think what we need to do is we need to go ahead and approve what we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8177)|
| 2:16:21| and then with a time limit, as Councilman Pavlis said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8181)|
| 2:16:28| know that we'll have a return in terms of when that would take place on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8188)|
| 2:16:37| That would be dependent on MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8197)|
| 2:16:39| Or you can go ahead and try to address those particular roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8199)|
| 2:16:43| but I think that when you go through the plan here, the major road plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8203)|
| 2:16:46| you'll find that there's a lot of contradictions in terms of where these roads are on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8206)|
| 2:16:52| Yeah, and you'll find a half dozen or so that are clearly commercial corridors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8212)|
| 2:16:57| and then you'll find a bunch of connector roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8217)|
| 2:17:01| that might be simply something that's draining traffic in a subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8221)|
| 2:17:05| and getting it to something like a major road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8225)|
| 2:17:07| whether it's Merchants Drive, Tazewell Pike, some other road that has commercial activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8227)|
| 2:17:13| I mean, I really thought that I'd be able to come tonight and say, here are the roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8233)|
| 2:17:16| but when you get into the major road plan, you find out it's a bit more complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8236)|
| 2:17:21| Some thick weeds in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8241)|
| 2:17:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8243)|
| 2:17:31| Well, that solves that, doesn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8251)|
| 2:17:35| George, anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8255)|
| 2:17:36| Councilman Wallace and Palmer have comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8256)|
| 2:17:38| Okay, Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8258)|
| 2:17:41| That's what we talked about back in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8261)|
| 2:17:43| We brought a motion to base it on the road plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8263)|
| 2:17:46| and this all came about really from recommendations that came from MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8266)|
| 2:17:52| to base sign height and sign area based on the road classification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8272)|
| 2:17:57| and those are the classifications that they gave, and we looked at adding those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8277)|
| 2:18:01| I mean, we looked at it, brought the road plan, we looked at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8281)|
| 2:18:06| and it was overwhelmingly killed right here in April in that marathon meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8286)|
| 2:18:11| because there are arterial roads that are labeled major arterial roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8291)|
| 2:18:15| that are purely residential and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8295)|
| 2:18:19| So I would have great hesitancy just picking roads based on what we think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8299)|
| 2:18:26| I mean, I think you'd have to go back to something that is a document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8306)|
| 2:18:31| that is greater than our selectivity and objectivity and pick them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8311)|
| 2:18:37| Well, I want this road, but I don't want that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8317)|
| 2:18:39| I think that would be wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8319)|
| 2:18:41| and you'd be opening yourself up to quite a bit of liability on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8321)|
| 2:18:45| I think you're going to have to pick one of this, and for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8325)|
| 2:18:49| I mean, we talked about it back in April and didn't want to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8329)|
| 2:18:53| and it's still a decent idea, but it also has thorns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8333)|
| 2:18:58| I mean, this is exactly what the sign task force went through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8338)|
| 2:19:01| and if anybody has qualms about whether the sign task force has done a lot of work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8341)|
| 2:19:05| you've seen tonight that we're wordsmithing stuff back with the legal department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8345)|
| 2:19:09| We had the legal department then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8349)|
| 2:19:11| They sat with us, but things change, and court decisions are handed down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8351)|
| 2:19:16| I mean, it's just really hard when you get into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8356)|
| 2:19:20| It's not that we don't know about signs or we haven't studied it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8360)|
| 2:19:24| This body has studied it over and over for the last three years, but it keeps changing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8364)|
| 2:19:30| and it's going to have to be a moving, living document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8370)|
| 2:19:34| There's no way for it to stay static.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8374)|
| 2:19:37| I think you have to pass it tonight and move on, but we have to, as Councilman Grief said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8377)|
| 2:19:43| he pledged that he was going to work on it until death do us part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8383)|
| 2:19:46| I'll never let him forget that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8386)|
| 2:19:49| You've been talking to my wife, haven't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8389)|
| 2:19:51| I mean, you know, I think with the examples that have been presented here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8391)|
| 2:19:55| you see pictures of signs that are 20 feet tall that are already in existence with reader boards on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8395)|
| 2:20:01| So it's not that they can't function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8401)|
| 2:20:05| Businesses are functioning well on busy corridors with other businesses around it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8405)|
| 2:20:10| that have much higher and taller and bigger signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8410)|
| 2:20:13| So it's not that it's so out of the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8413)|
| 2:20:18| Page after page of here, you've given us examples of signs on major corridors that are less than 20 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8418)|
| 2:20:26| So this is, it's not that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8426)|
| 2:20:30| There's nothing magical about the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8430)|
| 2:20:33| I mean, the consultant that stood up here tonight, it's objective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8433)|
| 2:20:38| Sign heights are objective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8438)|
| 2:20:40| He thinks they ought to be 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8440)|
| 2:20:41| We say they ought to be 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8441)|
| 2:20:44| I would bet that you couldn't tell the difference going by 55 miles an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8444)|
| 2:20:49| You mean subjective, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8449)|
| 2:20:50| Subjective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8450)|
| 2:20:51| Whoever's deciding it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8451)|
| 2:20:52| There's no, and we sat here and talked about sign area last time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8452)|
| 2:20:56| and it gave heartburn to some people about we're just picking numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8456)|
| 2:21:01| There's no mathematical equation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8461)|
| 2:21:04| The charts that you have in front of you tonight from other suggestions, they're all over the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8464)|
| 2:21:11| 20 feet, this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8471)|
| 2:21:14| We've got numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8474)|
| 2:21:15| We're going to fill them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8475)|
| 2:21:16| I mean, we tried to find something that's reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8476)|
| 2:21:19| But if there's no mathematical equation that says for a 20-foot sign, you have to have this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8479)|
| 2:21:25| And that is, it's up to this body to find what's reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8485)|
| 2:21:30| And I think that the numbers that, so they're all over the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8490)|
| 2:21:36| The numbers that Krista has put down here for sign area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8496)|
| 2:21:40| are numbers that came from a local sign company professional that sat on the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8500)|
| 2:21:45| And he threw those numbers out as ones that he saw in the marketplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8505)|
| 2:21:52| So maybe Greve, maybe somebody else has other numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8512)|
| 2:21:55| It's going to be just like sign height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8515)|
| 2:21:56| But those are actual sign heights that are used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8516)|
| 2:21:59| Areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8519)|
| 2:22:00| Areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8520)|
| 2:22:01| Excuse me, areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8521)|
| 2:22:02| But again, it's almost a range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8522)|
| 2:22:04| I mean, it's the upper end of that range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8524)|
| 2:22:05| I mean, it's all over the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8525)|
| 2:22:07| There's no correlation to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8527)|
| 2:22:10| It's very random, and it's very, you know, by the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8530)|
| 2:22:15| So, you know, my motion is we pass the sign height as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8535)|
| 2:22:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8541)|
| 2:22:22| Well, we don't need a motion if it's as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8542)|
| 2:22:26| So if there's no changes, that's two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8546)|
| 2:22:28| We're talking about the maximum sign height with the four categories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8548)|
| 2:22:33| four roadway types, and the 35, 30, 20, 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8553)|
| 2:22:37| That's the way it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8557)|
| 2:22:38| So unless there's a motion to change it, then we're right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8558)|
| 2:22:44| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8564)|
| 2:22:46| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8566)|
| 2:22:47| If we pass this sign ordinance as it appears before us tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8567)|
| 2:22:53| and then in six months we have worked with MPC and everybody else who has a role in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8573)|
| 2:23:01| and we come up with different heights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8581)|
| 2:23:05| we're going to end up with a number of businesses between the time this goes into effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8585)|
| 2:23:11| and the time that we have changes that might be very different that are going to get caught.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8591)|
| 2:23:19| And I'm concerned about what kind of a message is this sending to prospective businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8599)|
| 2:23:27| who are going to be looking at signs in the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8607)|
| 2:23:31| when they know that they can go to Knox County and the signage is different in heights and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8611)|
| 2:23:40| So it concerns me that we're going to pass something tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8620)|
| 2:23:46| and in six months it may be different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8626)|
| 2:23:49| but meanwhile those people who spent that money for signs between now and six months are just out of luck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8629)|
| 2:23:55| because that's what the ordinance was when they got their sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8635)|
| 2:24:01| Thank you. Vice Mayor Pavlos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8641)|
| 2:24:03| Yeah, I'm going to keep the tailspin going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8643)|
| 2:24:07| We haven't really discussed much, I don't think, about interstate signage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8647)|
| 2:24:12| and Knoxville is very unique in that we have three major interstates that affect our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8652)|
| 2:24:21| and it seems to me that Knoxville, I think it would be proven that we are a destination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8661)|
| 2:24:27| We always count ourselves as being two-thirds from the population of the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8667)|
| 2:24:33| and I think that folks use us as a stopping point when they're coming from Ohio or Michigan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8673)|
| 2:24:39| or coming up from the south going north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8679)|
| 2:24:43| And that's one point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8683)|
| 2:24:45| That's one point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8685)|
| 2:24:46| I just find it really hard to believe that if you're going down the interstate at 70, more than likely 75 miles an hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8686)|
| 2:24:54| or if you're going down a four-lane highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8694)|
| 2:24:58| Speeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8698)|
| 2:24:59| Excuse me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8699)|
| 2:25:00| Then you would be speeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8700)|
| 2:25:01| Well, they give you five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8701)|
| 2:25:05| Quite a bit more than five, but yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150721?start=8705)|
