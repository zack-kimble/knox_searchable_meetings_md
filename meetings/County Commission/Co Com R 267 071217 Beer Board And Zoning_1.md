| 2:18:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8282)|
| 2:18:03| Victor Jernigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8283)|
| 2:18:05| This location, when this, and this will take just a minute to answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8285)|
| 2:18:10| when this neighborhood was started originally, it was the perfect property, in my view, for an apartment neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8290)|
| 2:18:17| At the time that the original rezoning moved forward, we did not have a luxury apartment partner to build the apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8297)|
| 2:18:25| The situation is, if you're building luxury apartments, the magic number is 240 to 260 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8305)|
| 2:18:32| About 90 percent of all the apartments in America that are class A luxury apartments are in that size range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8312)|
| 2:18:38| You cannot have less than 200 units and get them realistically funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8318)|
| 2:18:44| The issue about what, and this is really the point, those of you who know me know that I buy land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8324)|
| 2:18:51| If I could find another location that was suitable in South Knoxville, I have a great partner in building luxury apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8331)|
| 2:18:59| We're doing six neighborhoods in the greater Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8339)|
| 2:19:02| If there was another location that was truly suitable, I would have already bought it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8342)|
| 2:19:06| I would be trying to buy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8346)|
| 2:19:07| I would be trying to assemble it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8347)|
| 2:19:10| But what we have is a unique situation where this property is the perfect location for a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8350)|
| 2:19:17| The reason that staff supported the change was because it is the logical and best place in South Knoxville for a sector plan change to build luxury apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8357)|
| 2:19:27| The neighborhood is offering, you know, buy on Chapman Highway or buy on the other side of John Sevier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8367)|
| 2:19:32| It creates a catch-22 situation where it is not possible to meet the requirements to make the South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8372)|
| 2:19:38| South Dwell Homeowners Association happy and buy enough land that's topographically correct where we're not clearing the top of a mountain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8378)|
| 2:19:47| or trying to build on top of a wetland to be able to build luxury apartments within a mile to a mile and a half of the retail component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8387)|
| 2:19:55| And that is the goal, to be within a mile to a mile and a half, closer if possible, but it's not possible at this intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8395)|
| 2:20:03| Again, all of the land that was previously medium-density residential on the South Knoxville sector plan that Bob just showed you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8403)|
| 2:20:09| was changed to commercial so that they could build a Home Depot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8409)|
| 2:20:14| And now the people who work at the Home Depot want to live in apartments in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8414)|
| 2:20:19| And that has been, and that is where the situation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8419)|
| 2:20:23| If there was another opportunity to do it, we would do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8423)|
| 2:20:27| It's just physically not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8427)|
| 2:20:30| Why is the mile to mile and a half radius, why is that so critical?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8430)|
| 2:20:36| Because what you're looking at doing is capturing the, and it is absolutely the truest situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8436)|
| 2:20:43| the closer you can get to the retail component, the less driving that the people have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8443)|
| 2:20:49| It is traffic neutral because right now we know that of the 3,500 or so people that are working at that intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8449)|
| 2:20:56| about 1,000 of them are living in rental housing in other parts of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8456)|
| 2:21:00| and driving more than 12 miles a day each way to go to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8460)|
| 2:21:03| And that's already been proven by the phone calls from the employers that I've spoken with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8463)|
| 2:21:07| So what happens is the closer you are to the neighborhood, the stronger your market study is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8467)|
| 2:21:13| The stronger your market study is, the easier the project is to get financed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8473)|
| 2:21:16| The further you are away, the more likely it is that some intervening period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8476)|
| 2:21:19| something could be built between you and the retail component, lessening your likelihood to continue to stay leased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8479)|
| 2:21:25| The concerns that the neighborhood has about a domino effect is not possible in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8485)|
| 2:21:33| First off, this is the only location that mirrors medium-density residential in all along John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8493)|
| 2:21:40| It is the only location that has direct access to a soon-to-be-improved John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8500)|
| 2:21:47| It is the only location along all of Johnson, from the French Broad all the way to the Alcoa Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8507)|
| 2:21:53| that can be built on to be able to make the apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8513)|
| 2:21:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8517)|
| 2:21:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8518)|
| 2:21:59| Just one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8519)|
| 2:22:00| Before all this information overwhelms me, I just had one more thing for Mark or Buzz Johnson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8520)|
| 2:22:07| and that was just a quick synopsis of the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8527)|
| 2:22:15| Why was it done, or why is this needed in your estimation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8535)|
| 2:22:24| One of the key indicators that we try to track is the relationship between jobs and homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8544)|
| 2:22:32| and obviously to have a community that's in balance, you want to keep that relationship as close to balance as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8552)|
| 2:22:39| If we look at Knox County, we are actually adding jobs at a much faster rate than we're adding population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8559)|
| 2:22:46| So at the bigger picture, we're kind of losing on that jobs-to-housing balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8566)|
| 2:22:53| and as a result, we get more and more traffic ingestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8573)|
| 2:22:56| We get more commuters coming in from outside of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8576)|
| 2:22:59| If you focus down into this particular area, we are adding jobs at a much more rapid pace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8579)|
| 2:23:07| than we are adding new dwelling units and new population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8587)|
| 2:23:11| So this plan amendment helps to create the opportunity to bring that into balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8591)|
| 2:23:20| Okay, but why at that spot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8600)|
| 2:23:22| given the scenic highway designation and the various, I mean, these conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8602)|
| 2:23:30| that we're trying to retain some of the agricultural aura of the area, why there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8610)|
| 2:23:40| It is in close proximity to a rapidly growing commercial node.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8620)|
| 2:23:45| It's at a place where John Sevier as a major arterial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8625)|
| 2:23:50| and Tipton Station Road as a major collector come close together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8630)|
| 2:23:54| so there's the opportunity to create some connections there in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8634)|
| 2:23:58| probably much to the chagrin of those people that live on Tipton Station,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8638)|
| 2:24:02| but smart growth dictates that you have highly connected development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8642)|
| 2:24:07| It is in an area where we do have an existing node of medium-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8647)|
| 2:24:14| We do, in fact, like to have like uses on opposite sides of a corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8654)|
| 2:24:19| rather than using a corridor to break between uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8659)|
| 2:24:28| Those are the three reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8668)|
| 2:24:33| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8673)|
| 2:24:34| Tony, the conditions that you had asked about earlier are in your packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8674)|
| 2:24:39| and they are on the handwritten, I put little handwritten numbers at the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8679)|
| 2:24:43| You will find that on page two, the 11 conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8683)|
| 2:24:47| and one of those was that a turn lane, number four was a, let's see here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8687)|
| 2:24:53| prior to obtaining any building permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8693)|
| 2:24:55| the applicant must construct a westbound left turn lane in West Governor John Sevier Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8695)|
| 2:25:01| as called for in the traffic impact study, and that had never been done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8701)|
| 2:25:05| and like Mr. Donaldson said, conditions have not been placed on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8705)|
| 2:25:09| but apparently MPC said that they will put some conditions on the apartment complex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8709)|
| 2:25:14| but that is on page two in your handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8714)|
| 2:25:17| Okay. Go ahead, Victor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8717)|
| 2:25:19| I would like to specifically answer that because that is exactly how we found out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8719)|
| 2:25:23| that John Sevier Highway was going to be resurfaced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8723)|
| 2:25:27| and turned into three lanes for the entire length of the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8727)|
| 2:25:31| that the project was going to move forward in March of this coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8731)|
| 2:25:33| TDOT requested that we delay any construction until they let their plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8733)|
| 2:25:38| so that we can coordinate with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8738)|
| 2:25:41| We asked at the time if we increased the density of the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8741)|
| 2:25:47| could we get a traffic signal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8747)|
| 2:25:49| We consulted with Wilbur Smith, and that's how we came,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8749)|
| 2:25:53| that was the proximate cause, the conversation with TDOT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8753)|
| 2:25:57| to express clearly that John Sevier Highway was going to be improved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8757)|
| 2:26:01| which gave us the confidence to be able to come back and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8761)|
| 2:26:04| this is a great location for apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8764)|
| 2:26:06| We can do some things which improve South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8766)|
| 2:26:09| create a great neighborhood that is not there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8769)|
| 2:26:13| and there's no other place to realistically put it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8773)|
| 2:26:15| and I own, candidly, or at least I bought the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8775)|
| 2:26:19| from the people who are remaining as my neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8779)|
| 2:26:22| So we're not infringing on any other neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8782)|
| 2:26:25| We are entering directly onto John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8785)|
| 2:26:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8788)|
| 2:26:30| Okay, we've got a motion on the floor to deny both of these and properly second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8790)|
| 2:26:35| We'll start in the first district, and we'll have a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8795)|
| 2:26:42| You're going to explain the vote, the yes, no on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8802)|
| 2:26:45| Yes means deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8805)|
| 2:26:51| Commissioner Strickland?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=8811)|

| 2:37:53| We would request that this matter be postponed until the April meeting of the county commission to await the outcome of that lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9473)|
| 2:38:05| Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9485)|
| 2:38:06| At this time we have a Kathy Akins here that is wanting to and is against this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9486)|
| 2:38:18| This has sort of been a little bit of a contentious type thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9498)|
| 2:38:21| And she wants to hear it, and I'm going to make the recommendation that we do hear it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9501)|
| 2:38:28| Very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9508)|
| 2:38:30| I don't think we really need commercial zoning on this property, but I did file this application on behalf of Mr. Gibbons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9510)|
| 2:38:39| The property is zoned agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9519)|
| 2:38:41| He has a rather large home on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9521)|
| 2:38:46| The lady mentioned by Commissioner Ballard takes a number of photographs of what he's doing over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9526)|
| 2:38:53| and is, to a certain extent, stalking him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9533)|
| 2:38:56| She contends that there is a commercial operation going on over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9536)|
| 2:39:02| We think it's consistent with the agricultural zone that his activities are, amongst other things, farms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9542)|
| 2:39:11| He timbers here and other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9551)|

| 2:39:24| He does hydro-seeding on power lines up in Morgan and Fentress County after discussion with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9564)|
| 2:39:33| I don't believe he's keeping his hydro-seeding equipment there anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9573)|
| 2:39:36| He keeps it on a nearby commercial lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9576)|
| 2:39:40| If you'll look at the map of the property, you'll see that there is commercial just to the east of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9580)|
| 2:39:46| and just to the north of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9586)|
| 2:39:48| Right now he is on a section of Straw Plains Pike that connects Asheville Highway with John Sevier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9588)|
| 2:39:55| and you will find commercial trucks running day and night up and down that stretch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9595)|
| 2:40:01| He really would prefer to leave it agricultural, but until we finish our lawsuit with Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9601)|
| 2:40:08| we do not know whether or not there is an issue on whether he needs commercial zoning on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9608)|
| 2:40:15| We would ask you to consider that and still like to request that this matter be postponed four months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9615)|
| 2:40:20| until we see the outcome of the lawsuit with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9620)|
| 2:40:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9624)|
| 2:40:25| Let me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9625)|
| 2:40:26| You would still like a postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9626)|
| 2:40:28| Commissioner Ballard would like to hear it today, but I guess we need a vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9628)|
| 2:40:32| So do you want to make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9632)|
| 2:40:34| Do we want to hear her first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9634)|

| 2:40:40| My name is Kathy Adkins, and I live at 8408 Strawberry Plains Pike across the street from Mr. Gibbons' property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9640)|
| 2:40:48| This is definitely a commercial business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9648)|
| 2:40:51| It was an established commercial business when it was moved onto the property in 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9651)|
| 2:40:56| One day, eight commercial trucks pulled up, all kinds of earth-moving equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9656)|
| 2:41:04| About ten men came to work on the property and drive the trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9664)|
| 2:41:08| It has been to the MPC two times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9668)|
| 2:41:12| Each time, it was unanimously declined by every member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9672)|
| 2:41:18| It's a terrible place for a commercial business for many reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9678)|
| 2:41:22| There has been eight accidents in less than two months within feet of his driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9682)|
| 2:41:29| When those commercial trucks pull out of his driveway, the people that are coming down Strawberry Plains Pike cannot see it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9689)|
| 2:41:35| until it's too late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9695)|
| 2:41:37| There are black skid marks on both sides of the driveway that show the panic of people when there's nowhere to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9697)|
| 2:41:43| There was an accident yesterday at his driveway that landed in my front field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9703)|
| 2:41:48| The noise starts early in the morning, sometimes before daylight, and it goes all the way into the night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9708)|
| 2:41:54| sometimes until 10 o'clock at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9714)|
| 2:41:57| There are people working constantly on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9717)|
| 2:42:02| It's not uncommon for the trucks to come and go four or five at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9722)|
| 2:42:07| It is not a man with a truck, as he told the MPC commissioners in the first meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9727)|
| 2:42:13| It was an established commercial hydro-seeding business that I think he had in Alcoa before he moved into Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9733)|
| 2:42:21| It is not considered a home occupation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9741)|
| 2:42:25| It is not a farm business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9745)|
| 2:42:28| He dropped his Gibbons landscape and hydro-seeding license in January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9748)|
| 2:42:35| and said that he was not doing any hydro-seeding in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9755)|
| 2:42:39| but was doing hydro-seeding in counties that did not require him to have a business license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9759)|
| 2:42:45| I saw him hydro-seed two properties on their street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9765)|
| 2:42:49| One was Creekside and the other one was on McCubbins Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9769)|
| 2:42:52| Those were two that I saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9772)|
| 2:42:54| There's men that come constantly to the property to drive these huge trucks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9774)|
| 2:42:59| and it's a terrible place to put in the middle of their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9779)|
| 2:43:04| If ever there was any spot zoning, this would be commercial spot zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9784)|
| 2:43:10| There is no business around us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9790)|
| 2:43:12| It's agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9792)|
| 2:43:14| He moved this business in as an established business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9794)|
| 2:43:17| and put it right in the middle of our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9797)|
| 2:43:20| You can't sit out in the evening because of the warning signals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9800)|
| 2:43:24| that come off the machines that they load the trucks with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9804)|
| 2:43:27| The semi-deliveries were constant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9807)|
| 2:43:30| until the Knox County Law Department sent a cease and desist letter to him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9810)|
| 2:43:35| which he ignored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9815)|
| 2:43:37| He got a stop work order after the first MPC denial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9817)|
| 2:43:41| and as I said before, every member on the MPC voted against giving him commercial rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9821)|
| 2:43:48| to keep this commercial business that he moved onto the agriculture zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9828)|
| 2:43:55| He ignored the stop work order that came after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9835)|
| 2:43:58| Six months later, the law department reviewed the photographs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9838)|
| 2:44:02| which showed men working on the property, loading the trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9842)|
| 2:44:08| There was 20 or 30 photographs that couldn't deny what they were doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9848)|
| 2:44:12| The cease and desist letter didn't do a thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9852)|
| 2:44:16| His response to that was he got a new business license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9856)|
| 2:44:20| Now, this new business license that he got was for Gibbons Farms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9860)|
| 2:44:24| Well, I can tell you since he moved on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9864)|
| 2:44:27| there has been no farm animals and no farm crops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9867)|
| 2:44:30| The only thing it has to do with farms is he painted it on his hydro-sitting trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9870)|
| 2:44:34| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9874)|
| 2:44:36| And he's parked the trucks next to the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9876)|
| 2:44:38| And his phone number is this big on the trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9878)|
| 2:44:42| There's a list of everything that he'll do for you on these trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9882)|
| 2:44:47| And, you know, the neighborhood's tired of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9887)|
| 2:44:50| It's been three years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9890)|
| 2:44:52| He's ignored the codes department, the MPC, the Knox County Law Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9892)|
| 2:45:01| and now Mr. Bruce Weitrick has filed a lawsuit against him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9901)|
| 2:45:06| That lawsuit is because he will not accept the authority of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9906)|
| 2:45:13| That's why he has the lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9913)|
| 2:45:16| They didn't just file this lawsuit on him for nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9916)|
| 2:45:20| And to put this off, he tried to have it tabled at the MPC meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9920)|
| 2:45:24| and they wouldn't allow it, and it was heard, and they denied it by unanimous vote again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9924)|
| 2:45:30| It's a terrible place for a commercial business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9930)|
| 2:45:33| He will not accept the fact that this is not zoned for his landscaping, hydro-sitting commercial business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9933)|
| 2:45:40| That's what the sector plan is for, is to protect neighborhoods like mine from spot zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9940)|
| 2:45:46| Our neighborhood doesn't need a sector change plan for a hydro-sitting company to move in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9946)|
| 2:45:54| And it's dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9954)|
| 2:45:56| You can check the police reports that have come out and went to these wrecks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9956)|
| 2:46:02| I gave photographs of these wrecks to the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9962)|
| 2:46:07| I gave photographs of the trucks coming and going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9967)|

| 2:46:28| And nobody is able to stop him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9988)|
| 2:46:31| We will not stop the commercial business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9991)|
| 2:46:33| Please help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9993)|
| 2:46:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9994)|
| 2:46:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=9995)|
| 2:46:41| I'll be very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10001)|
| 2:46:43| Mr. Gibbons has bought additional property adjacent to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10003)|
| 2:46:48| He is fencing it so there can be livestock there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10008)|
| 2:46:55| That will necessitate commercial trucks coming and going simply to add fencing and barns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10015)|
| 2:47:03| and so forth and feed lots to his agricultural activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10023)|
| 2:47:09| I would reiterate, though, that we would request that this matter be postponed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10029)|
| 2:47:14| until the lawsuit is settled one way or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10034)|
| 2:47:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10037)|
| 2:47:18| Commissioner Luthold, you got a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10038)|
| 2:47:21| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10041)|
| 2:47:23| Again, we're getting into items that have to do with what's on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10043)|
| 2:47:30| not about whether or not we're going to hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10050)|
| 2:47:32| I think let's either hear it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10052)|
| 2:47:34| So do we have a motion to hear it or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10054)|
| 2:47:38| I'll make a motion and we'll go ahead and hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10058)|
| 2:47:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10061)|
| 2:47:43| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10063)|
| 2:47:44| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10064)|
| 2:47:46| I really think we're setting a bad precedence here by putting these things off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10066)|
| 2:47:51| It has generally been our policy in the past for at least as long as I've been on this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10071)|
| 2:47:57| that if someone's not prepared or if there's mitigating circumstances that cause someone to want to put something off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10077)|
| 2:48:05| that we've always allowed them to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10085)|
| 2:48:07| And I think that we are, if we do this a second time today, we are setting a real precedence that is not good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10087)|
| 2:48:13| If folks are not ready or if there are circumstances that may change a person's desire even for the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10093)|
| 2:48:22| I think that we need to give them the benefit of that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10102)|
| 2:48:25| And so I'm going to vote against this because I believe we should give them the time they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10105)|
| 2:48:33| Commissioner Luthold?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10113)|
| 2:48:34| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10114)|
| 2:48:35| Is Bruce Weitrick here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10115)|
| 2:48:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10123)|
| 2:48:49| Bruce, since you're the one that brought forth the lawsuit on behalf of Knox County or at least that's what we're hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10129)|
| 2:48:58| do you think we should hold off on hearing this or should we hear this tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10138)|
| 2:49:02| I mean, what does it do to your case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10142)|
| 2:49:04| Probably wouldn't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10144)|
| 2:49:05| I'm represented by counsel and he's out in the audience right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10145)|
| 2:49:08| You might want to ask Mr. Owens, but as far as I know, it would have no effect on the case one way or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10148)|
| 2:49:15| That would be my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10155)|
| 2:49:16| I don't know that it makes any difference whether you act on it tonight or later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10156)|
| 2:49:20| I think at the end of the day, he is running the business from that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10160)|
| 2:49:24| So unless you rezone the property, in my opinion, it's not a legal operation on that particular piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10164)|
| 2:49:31| So unless you intend to rezone the property, if that's your intention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10171)|
| 2:49:35| I suggest you act on it, go ahead and rezone it or deny it and deal with it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10175)|
| 2:49:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10178)|
| 2:49:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10185)|
| 2:49:46| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10186)|
| 2:49:47| Ma'am, will you come back down here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10187)|
| 2:49:49| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10189)|
| 2:49:57| And what's this gentleman's name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10197)|
| 2:50:02| Mr. Gibson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10202)|
| 2:50:06| Is that his name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10206)|
| 2:50:07| Gibbons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10207)|
| 2:50:08| Gibbons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10208)|
| 2:50:09| Is he here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10209)|
| 2:50:10| He seems to be hiding in the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10210)|
| 2:50:11| I'd like to see him out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10211)|
| 2:50:12| These seem to be pretty serious things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10212)|
| 2:50:14| Come out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10214)|
| 2:50:15| We can see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10215)|
| 2:50:20| You know, Commissioner Lambert, you know, you were talking about, you know, putting off and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10220)|
| 2:50:24| I understand what you're saying and what we had from Mr. Jernigan, what he had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10224)|
| 2:50:31| But this seems to be that somebody's running something illegal and she wants something done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10231)|
| 2:50:36| and to ask for it to be delayed four months, not 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10236)|
| 2:50:39| She's talking four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10239)|
| 2:50:40| That's hoping that the problem will go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10240)|
| 2:50:42| It's been three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10242)|
| 2:50:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10243)|
| 2:50:44| This looks pretty blatant to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10244)|
| 2:50:45| And I've seen this stuff before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10245)|
| 2:50:47| So I'm ready to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10247)|
| 2:50:52| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10252)|
| 2:50:53| You can have a seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10253)|
| 2:50:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10254)|
| 2:50:55| Help me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10255)|
| 2:50:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10257)|
| 2:50:58| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10258)|
| 2:50:59| Motion to put it on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10259)|
| 2:51:01| You wanted to hear it today and it was properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10261)|
| 2:51:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10264)|
| 2:51:05| Let me describe this area here to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10265)|
| 2:51:08| Mr. Seymour is right that truck traffic is on this road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10268)|
| 2:51:11| but it's relatively light truck traffic that is not making right or left turns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10271)|
| 2:51:18| The probably to the east, you have the Stormer Shopping Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10278)|
| 2:51:25| and the erection company that I believe Knox County owns for the new Carter Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10285)|
| 2:51:31| So I guess that would be fair to say 1,000, 2,000 yards to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10291)|
| 2:51:38| Then you do not have another commercial establishment until you get to the Holiday Inn east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10298)|
| 2:51:44| that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10304)|
| 2:51:46| On the left side, you do have two churches on the left in this same zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10306)|
| 2:51:52| that covers about three miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10312)|
| 2:51:54| He has had accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10314)|
| 2:51:56| He's had a little bit of the independence and trying to be kind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10316)|
| 2:52:01| And he's continued his operations against MPC and thus we're in this lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10321)|
| 2:52:09| I will say that he has made his yard and landscaped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10329)|
| 2:52:12| It's a very beautiful thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10332)|
| 2:52:14| But the essence of this is that he's continued to operate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10334)|
| 2:52:17| She's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10337)|
| 2:52:18| He's parked his trucks on the road there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10338)|
| 2:52:20| I go by often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10340)|
| 2:52:21| And, you know, basically it's a billboard for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10341)|
| 2:52:24| And I believe, if I'm not mistaken, he has three mailboxes for the one location there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10344)|
| 2:52:29| And I've received numerous, numerous calls on it a lot from Kathy Akins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10349)|
| 2:52:35| whenever they were loading and unloading trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10355)|
| 2:52:39| So as, you know, things become a matter of principles, you get really locked into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10359)|
| 2:52:46| And she's sort of in that mode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10366)|
| 2:52:48| But it started, I think, with some legitimate complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10368)|
| 2:52:51| It's been appealed by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10371)|
| 2:52:53| It's been appealed by the code department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10373)|
| 2:52:55| And we have a pending lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10375)|
| 2:52:57| I don't think the lawsuit has anything to do with whether it's zoned or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10377)|
| 2:53:03| But in light of the accidents, the close proximity to what may be Carter Elementary at one day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10383)|
| 2:53:11| and no other commercial project that I see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10391)|
| 2:53:15| especially home-based and relatively one to two, three miles from any other commercial property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10395)|
| 2:53:25| Actually, on the other side, there are several that could be rented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10405)|
| 2:53:29| But that's not the issue that we have before us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10409)|
| 2:53:33| So I could not go along with any zoning to commercial other than what it is at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10413)|
| 2:53:41| So we've got a motion to go ahead and hear it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10421)|
| 2:53:45| So vote yes would hear it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10425)|
| 2:53:47| Vote no would be not to hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10427)|
| 2:53:50| Everybody ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10430)|
| 2:53:52| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10432)|
| 2:53:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10433)|
| 2:53:54| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10434)|
| 2:53:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10435)|
| 2:53:57| Commissioner Lambert, the only one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10437)|
| 2:53:59| Apparently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10439)|
| 2:54:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10441)|
| 2:54:03| So we're ready to hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10443)|
| 2:54:05| So I guess Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10445)|
| 2:54:07| Well, I realize you all have a long agenda tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10447)|
| 2:54:11| I don't want to belabor this anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10451)|
| 2:54:14| There is a difference of opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10454)|
| 2:54:17| CODES has issued, yes, a cease and desist after an NOV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10457)|
| 2:54:21| They have not cited Mr. Gibbons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10461)|
| 2:54:24| As I understand, there have been no complaints in a number of months about his operation there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10464)|
| 2:54:29| He is running an agricultural operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10469)|
| 2:54:33| That's his business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10473)|
| 2:54:34| Hydro seeding, timbering, those are all agricultural pursuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10474)|
| 2:54:39| He is also bringing livestock onto the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10479)|
| 2:54:44| He's having it fenced now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10484)|
| 2:54:46| And he's purchased additional property there, and he will be feeding animals there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10486)|
| 2:54:51| and raising them to maturity until they can be slaughtered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10491)|
| 2:54:55| But that's his business there, and he will continue to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10495)|
| 2:54:59| And I think all that's permitted in the agricultural zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10499)|
| 2:55:04| However, if there is a difference of opinion with whether Knox County or Mr. Gibbons wins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10504)|
| 2:55:10| and chance to record is something we won't know until early April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10510)|
| 2:55:15| But I think status quo ought to be maintained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10515)|
| 2:55:20| I've lost the motion to postpone, and I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10520)|
| 2:55:25| I think a court will hear both sides, will examine the evidence closely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10525)|
| 2:55:30| and I feel Mr. Gibbons will prevail in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10530)|
| 2:55:33| So if you do desire to turn down the rezoning, he will continue operating there as he has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10533)|
| 2:55:40| and I think he'll be vindicated by the court saying all of his businesses there are agricultural pursuits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10540)|
| 2:55:45| which are permitted in the agricultural zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10545)|
| 2:55:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10549)|
| 2:55:50| Thank you, Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10550)|
| 2:55:51| Mr. Wheatry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10551)|
| 2:55:53| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10553)|
| 2:55:54| I just want to respond to one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10554)|
| 2:55:56| Mr. Seymour said the codes department had not cited them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10556)|
| 2:55:59| Early on I discussed this with the inspector that was dealing with this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10559)|
| 2:56:03| We realized it's a simple citation to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10563)|
| 2:56:06| It wasn't going to remedy the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10566)|
| 2:56:08| We felt like that's the reason we went filing the lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10568)|
| 2:56:11| We felt like going out there and writing a citation would just be a continuous thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10571)|
| 2:56:15| We'd have to be back out there writing another citation, another citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10575)|
| 2:56:18| So we opted to go the court route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10578)|
| 2:56:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10582)|
| 2:56:23| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10583)|
| 2:56:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10584)|
| 2:56:25| Arthur, is it my understanding that you don't believe that you really need the rezoning to do what your client is doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10585)|
| 2:56:35| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10595)|
| 2:56:36| I think the court can very well find every activity that's going on on the property is permitted in the agricultural zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10596)|
| 2:56:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10605)|
| 2:56:46| And he is expanding his agricultural activities there to a feedlot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10606)|
| 2:56:52| Well, I'm certainly not an expert on farming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10612)|
| 2:56:56| I'm not either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10616)|
| 2:56:57| Mr. Gibbons is that expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10617)|
| 2:56:59| But would you like to just withdraw this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10619)|
| 2:57:04| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10624)|
| 2:57:05| We would be happy to withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10625)|
| 2:57:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10627)|
| 2:57:08| I thought that might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10628)|
| 2:57:10| I would request it be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10630)|
| 2:57:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10632)|
| 2:57:13| Do we have a motion to withdraw it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10633)|
| 2:57:17| Motion to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10637)|
| 2:57:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10639)|
| 2:57:20| Second by Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10640)|
| 2:57:22| And, in fact, with the withdrawal, it's just the same consequences if he were to get turned down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10642)|
| 2:57:28| It's the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10648)|
| 2:57:29| Can I say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10649)|
| 2:57:30| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10650)|
| 2:57:31| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10651)|
| 2:57:32| What he intends to do has nothing to do with what he's done for the last three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10652)|
| 2:57:37| He could put a movie theater in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10657)|
| 2:57:39| He could put a skating rink in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10659)|
| 2:57:41| And, as a matter of fact, he just built two buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10661)|
| 2:57:44| One of them is 6,000 square foot concrete and steel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10664)|
| 2:57:48| You could put a skating rink in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10668)|
| 2:57:51| That's not an agriculture barn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10671)|
| 2:57:54| There's no barns like that in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10674)|
| 2:57:56| That was built for the commercial hydro seating company, the commercial hydro seating company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10676)|
| 2:58:06| And, ma'am, that's what you'll be able to argue with in front of the judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10686)|
| 2:58:11| Tonight all we can do is whether to grant him the commercial or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10691)|
| 2:58:15| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10695)|
| 2:58:17| It sounds like Knox County has responded to your complaints with Mr. Weitrich filing a lawsuit trying to stop what he's doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10697)|
| 2:58:25| And so that's as far as what we can do at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10705)|
| 2:58:28| What I wanted just to say again is what he is going to do makes no difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10708)|
| 2:58:34| We're here tonight because of what he's been doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10714)|
| 2:58:37| There's a lawsuit that's been filed against him because of what he's been doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10717)|
| 2:58:44| Tonight we're voting to see if we rezone the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10724)|
| 2:58:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10728)|
| 2:58:49| So we've got a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10729)|

| 2:58:51| Withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10731)|

| 2:58:53| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10733)|

| 3:01:51| I want to pass out a copy of the development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10911)|
| 3:01:58| It's a reduced copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10918)|
| 3:01:59| Shaded in yellow is the area of property that I'm going to be primarily talking about as far as the request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10919)|
| 3:02:08| for waivers and variances are concerned in connection with this request for certificate of appropriateness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10928)|
| 3:02:16| While Mr. King is doing that, Buzz, could you tell the rest of the commission what you told me about this piece of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10936)|
| 3:02:24| property that wasn't there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10944)|
| 3:02:26| You found some new information since the TTCDA had heard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10946)|
| 3:02:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10949)|
| 3:02:30| This was reviewed by TTCDA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10950)|
| 3:02:34| and it's property that's located on the west side of the parkway south of Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10954)|
| 3:02:40| Back in 2006, TTCDA heard a request for property located just to the north of this for an expansion of an existing building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10960)|
| 3:02:51| The issue at that time that came out of that review was a request of a waiver of a setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10971)|
| 3:02:56| For property located along the parkway, that's considered frontage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10976)|
| 3:03:02| and it has an extreme setback according to the design guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10982)|
| 3:03:08| I think it's fair to say what we have found in the past that for some properties it's very difficult to meet that setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10988)|
| 3:03:14| So on occasion waivers have been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10994)|
| 3:03:18| When we discussed the item that you have before you tonight, we did not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=10998)|
| 3:03:22| and frankly I had forgotten about that particular case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=11002)|
| 3:03:27| and the waiver that was approved for the setback for that property from the parkway frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=11007)|
| 3:03:33| The big issue with regard to this was the waiver of the setback for this development that Mr. King is now representing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=11013)|
| 3:03:42| There are a couple of other waivers and variances that were a part of that review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=11022)|
| 3:03:48| What is before you now is a denial of the entire plan for lack of a second to a motion to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=11028)|
| 3:03:56| So, Craig, I hope that's what you wanted me to tell the Board in terms of giving them some background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=11036)|
| 3:04:02| as to some additional information that, frankly, we didn't discuss at the tech quarter meeting when they met in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=11042)|
| 3:04:11| Buzz, when we heard it, it was the staff recommendation to approve it at the time, was it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=11051)|
| 3:04:17| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=11057)|
| 3:04:19| So I know Mr. King is there ready to have his speech all written, but I'll just go ahead and make a motion to approve the change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=11059)|
| 3:04:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=11069)|
| 3:04:31| So that we're clear on this, I don't want to be like one time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=11071)|
| 3:04:39| I don't want to be in a position like a judge who sort of took over things in my case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=11079)|
| 3:04:46| and I said I appreciated him taking over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=11086)|
| 3:04:51| I thought I was in good shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=11091)|
| 3:04:52| I hope he didn't lose it for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=11092)|
| 3:04:55| So I don't mind you taking over as long as we don't get distracted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=11095)|
| 3:05:03| What we have here in the motion, as I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=11103)|
| 3:05:07| is to approve the certificate of appropriateness with the recommended waivers and variances requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=11107)|
| 3:05:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=11118)|
| 3:05:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=11119)|
| 3:05:21| Given that, if you all are disposed to do so, I'll keep this short and sweet and stand for any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-beer-board-and-zoning?start=11121)|
