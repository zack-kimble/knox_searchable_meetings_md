| 0:03:41| To speak? Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=221)|

| 0:03:56| and hillside protection because it is consistent with the surrounding development by a vote of 13 to 0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=236)|

| 0:04:26| Yes, I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=266)|
| 0:04:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=267)|
| 0:04:28| Do I need to repeat myself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=268)|
| 0:04:29| If you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=269)|
| 0:04:31| I want to thank the Planning Commission and this commission for hearing this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=271)|
| 0:04:36| and I'm willing to answer any questions or comments they may have in this regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=276)|
| 0:04:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=281)|
| 0:04:42| Mr. Murphy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=282)|
| 0:04:45| Thank you, Madam Chairwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=285)|
| 0:04:49| Kevin Murphy, 4508.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=289)|
| 0:04:50| I'll go for about three minutes and then she'll swing in after me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=290)|
| 0:04:56| So this one, I'll speak on both the sector plan and the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=296)|
| 0:05:01| The sector plan amendment, this one is a request to go to rural residential, which could be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=301)|
| 0:05:10| But, again, this is a strange thing, or not strange, but in the northeast sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=310)|
| 0:05:14| you can do planned residential zone, which is the ultimate zoning that's being requested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=314)|
| 0:05:19| and either under rural residential or ag, it allows up to one unit per acre in the land use classification table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=319)|
| 0:05:27| This one, I did note in the staff report that came out that there's four potential criteria that are looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=327)|
| 0:05:34| to see if the sector plan amendment is justified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=334)|
| 0:05:36| And this one, the staff report actually said for each one of those four that there wasn't a threshold being met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=336)|
| 0:05:43| There wasn't major changes in the area for the last few decades, no significant roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=343)|
| 0:05:47| no error or omission in the plan, and no information that has revealed the need for a plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=347)|
| 0:05:53| So you could leave it ag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=353)|
| 0:05:57| And I want to point out, I put a map on the second page of the mailing that I sent you, emailed you yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=357)|
| 0:06:05| that shows this parcel is in a C of the ag sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=365)|
| 0:06:10| There is some darker green, which is public park, that's the Three Ridges Golf Course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=370)|
| 0:06:14| and then you've got blue for institutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=374)|
| 0:06:16| But you just see a C of ag sector plan out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=376)|
| 0:06:19| and that was an intentional thing that was made during the 2015 sector plan update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=379)|
| 0:06:24| And then regarding the rezoning and density, I do want to point out that that one was, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=384)|
| 0:06:31| an area where we looked at that table very specifically when the sector plan was updated and adopted in 2015-2016,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=391)|
| 0:06:41| and that was something that the residents felt very strongly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=401)|
| 0:06:43| that the limitation of one unit per acre for items in the rural area in both the ag sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=403)|
| 0:06:50| and rural residential was really important for the character of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=410)|
| 0:06:55| and influencing the development pattern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=415)|
| 0:06:57| So we'd ask you to particularly uphold the rezoning to be in accordance with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=417)|
| 0:07:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=425)|
| 0:07:08| Thank you, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=428)|
| 0:07:09| Ma'am, would you please state your name and address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=429)|
| 0:07:12| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=432)|
| 0:07:13| Dr. Nancy Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=433)|
| 0:07:14| I live at 6653 Ridgeview Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=434)|
| 0:07:19| I will be very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=439)|
| 0:07:21| I'm not here to ask that you deny this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=441)|
| 0:07:23| but I would respectfully request perhaps before you do change from one unit per acre that we might get a continuance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=443)|
| 0:07:32| or a delay so that our neighbors and those most impacted could continue to talk with the health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=452)|
| 0:07:39| and get the reports that they've been looking for to really understand what this means for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=459)|
| 0:07:43| We have not found success in getting that type of information just yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=463)|
| 0:07:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=469)|
| 0:07:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=470)|
| 0:07:55| Mr. Bolton, do you have any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=475)|
| 0:07:57| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=477)|
| 0:08:01| I provided the commission for their work meeting a two-page letter which supported my positions on this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=481)|
| 0:08:12| I have identified 10 properties within a half mile each direction of my properties that are residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=492)|
| 0:08:21| They're a half acre or less maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=501)|
| 0:08:24| And so I don't find quite the exception that was noted by Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=504)|
| 0:08:30| I would also like to state that, again, as with the planning commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=510)|
| 0:08:39| I received no personal contact from any of my neighbors asking for any questions or information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=519)|
| 0:08:47| I sent 10 letters out, received none, no responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=527)|
| 0:08:55| I'm more than willing to discuss with my neighbors, but none of them have approached me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=535)|
| 0:09:01| and my information is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=541)|
| 0:09:04| It was so in the letter I sent, and you've seen a copy of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=544)|
| 0:09:07| I provided it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=547)|
| 0:09:12| I'm more than willing to consider a postponement to address their concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=552)|
| 0:09:19| if they're willing to discuss this with me in a respectful manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=559)|
| 0:09:25| I've heard some comments from an individual in the neighborhood that would speak otherwise, and I regret that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=565)|
| 0:09:37| So I don't know what you want to hear from me to help any further on this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=577)|
| 0:09:43| but I'm willing to answer your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=583)|

| 0:09:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=587)|
| 0:09:50| I now look to my fellow commissioners for any questions or comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=590)|
| 0:09:59| Seeing none, I will look to our district commissioner for this project, Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=599)|
| 0:10:03| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=603)|
| 0:10:06| Mr. Bolton, I do want to thank you for what you provided to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=606)|
| 0:10:09| It was very helpful, and I thought very detailed about a lot of the reasons why you thought these changes were warranted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=609)|
| 0:10:18| I just want to say, dealing with this first item, I spoke to this at the discussion last week during our work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=618)|
| 0:10:28| Irrespective of what we do on the zoning with regard to density and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=628)|
| 0:10:34| I do support the sector plan amendment as was recommended by the Planning Commission staff and commission to rural residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=634)|
| 0:10:43| for the simple reason that that's what Ridgeview Road is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=643)|
| 0:10:47| Ridgeview Road is a rural residential area from one end to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=647)|
| 0:10:52| Nobody is farming Ridgeview Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=652)|
| 0:10:54| Nobody is farming the areas directly adjacent to Ridgeview Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=654)|
| 0:10:57| So rural residential just makes too much sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=657)|
| 0:11:01| I'll speak to where we are with the zoning on the next item, because that is a different issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=661)|
| 0:11:08| because that has to do with density and exactly what might go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=668)|
| 0:11:14| I think there's no harm in amending the sector plan to rural residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=674)|
| 0:11:20| because it simply makes more sense than the current designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=680)|
| 0:11:24| I would move to approve the sector plan amendment from agricultural hillside protection to rural residential hillside protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=684)|
| 0:11:33| per the recommendation of the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=693)|
| 0:11:40| Motion on the floor is to approve the sector plan amendment to rural residential and hillside protection by Commissioner Beeler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=700)|
| 0:11:47| with a second by Commissioner Daly. Commissioner Frazier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| Thank you, Madam Chair, and I will follow the lead of the District Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=710)|
| 0:11:53| I just want to remind the body that we had a case come before us just last month that was very similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=713)|
| 0:12:00| and that it is possibly a spot plan change to the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=720)|
| 0:12:06| As you all know, I'm not truly for amending our sector plan when I find it unnecessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=726)|
| 0:12:14| I do still feel like this is an unnecessary change, as the applicant can probably achieve the same outcome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=734)|
| 0:12:23| by keeping the sector plan, but out of respect for Commissioner Beeler, I will yield to his comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=743)|
| 0:12:33| Thank you. Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=753)|
| 0:12:34| Thank you. I will need to recuse myself on this one and the following item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=754)|
| 0:12:39| Is there any more discussion regarding item number 53?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=759)|
| 0:12:46| Seeing none, the motion on the floor is to approve per Planning Commission's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=766)|
| 0:12:51| All those in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=771)|
| 0:12:54| Any opposed? That motion carries. Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=774)|
| 0:12:59| This is item number 54, 12-A-22-RZ, request of John Bolton for rezoning from A Agricultural to PR Plan Residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=779)|
| 0:13:11| up to two dwelling units per acre, property located at 06702 and 6706 Ridgeview Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=791)|
| 0:13:21| parcel ID 030-15201-15307 and 15308. This is in the 8th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=801)|
| 0:13:33| Thank you, Madam Clerk. Mr. Bolton, if you would please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=813)|
| 0:13:39| John Bolton, 5421 Great Lakes Drive, Evansville, Indiana.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=819)|
| 0:13:44| Is there anyone to speak to this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=824)|
| 0:13:47| Sure. Regarding density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=827)|
| 0:13:51| Sir, I was asking if there was anyone here to speak to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=831)|
| 0:13:55| Sir, if you would please approach the podium and while you are, Director Welch, will you please read the Planning Commission's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=835)|
| 0:14:01| Planning Commission recommendation is to approve the planned residential zone with a density of up to one dwelling unit per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=841)|
| 0:14:08| because it is consistent with surrounding development by a vote of 9-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=848)|
| 0:14:13| Okay. Thank you. Mr. Bolton, again, you get to go first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=853)|
| 0:14:18| and then the other gentleman will have time to speak after you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=858)|
| 0:14:26| I'm going to open by saying I'm willing to consider a postponement on this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=866)|
| 0:14:30| if the Commission is not comfortable in accepting the information I've presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=870)|
| 0:14:40| Again, I'm going to refer to the information I provided for the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=880)|
| 0:14:45| Specifically, I want to point out that the difference between the present agricultural zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=885)|
| 0:14:51| if this property is subdivided and developed, that's eight properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=891)|
| 0:15:00| Under the rezoning with the limit of one unit per acre, it adds only one in quantity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=900)|
| 0:15:11| which doesn't make sense to me to go through this process, spend this time and effort for just one unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=911)|
| 0:15:22| So if I can't convince my neighbors to agree with me that a little more density is not appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=922)|
| 0:15:33| I would rather have the time to discuss that privately with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=933)|
| 0:15:38| and bring this back to the Commission at a future date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=938)|
| 0:15:42| Otherwise, if we can reach an understanding this evening, that would be fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=942)|
| 0:15:49| It will save me more trips, more expense, and your time to hear this issue again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=949)|
| 0:15:56| I've done some math, if it helps, to state that I can provide information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=956)|
| 0:16:10| I'm sorry, am I presenting something unacceptable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=970)|
| 0:16:17| You're fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=977)|
| 0:16:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=978)|
| 0:16:22| I can present information that shows that the property can very easily support 16 dwelling units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=982)|
| 0:16:35| which are slightly less than the two unit per acre, which would be a 1.78 unit per acre density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=995)|
| 0:16:45| I'm going to leave it at that and allow others that want to speak to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1005)|
| 0:16:53| As far as what the health department, I was advised that that would be in the next step of this phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1013)|
| 0:17:03| and I have approached the health department and likewise was told so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1023)|
| 0:17:09| So I'm trying to follow the procedures and the information that I have been given,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1029)|
| 0:17:14| and I know that's the next step, and it will be coming before this board once again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1034)|
| 0:17:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1039)|
| 0:17:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1041)|
| 0:17:22| Sir, if you would please approach the podium and state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1042)|
| 0:17:28| My name is Preston Cooper, and I live at 6658 Ridgeview Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1048)|
| 0:17:33| On this parcel of land, there's 7.45 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1053)|
| 0:17:37| In speaking with the health department today in their mapping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1057)|
| 0:17:41| there's a pond on the property which could not have a septic tank put on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1061)|
| 0:17:45| and there is a natural water runoff that septic tanks could not be put on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1065)|
| 0:17:50| I asked the lady at the health department what the minimum requirement would be for a septic system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1070)|
| 0:17:57| for a three-bedroom house, which would kind of be standard for that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1077)|
| 0:18:01| and she stated that you would need roughly 100 by 80 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1081)|
| 0:18:09| so 8,000 square feet for the septic system with a 10-foot easement on each side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1089)|
| 0:18:15| So for the septic system alone, you would need 9,900 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1095)|
| 0:18:21| A half-acre lot is 2,100 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1101)|
| 0:18:24| So when you take that off, he would have roughly enough to put a house on a half-acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1104)|
| 0:18:31| In the property, the question was 7.45 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1111)|
| 0:18:38| He would have to put a right-of-way down the middle of it, which would take up an acre and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1118)|
| 0:18:43| So his proposal for 16 houses is just not viable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1123)|
| 0:18:47| and I don't see why the planning committee would want to rezone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1127)|
| 0:18:51| and change what's there without a proposed plan that's feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1131)|
| 0:18:57| So I'm not against building and developing the property, but I do want a good plan for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1137)|
| 0:19:03| And being that the property is right up against my house and property, I would like to know what that would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1143)|
| 0:19:09| And, you know, like I said, I'm not opposed to the development of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1149)|
| 0:19:14| I just want a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1154)|
| 0:19:15| I just want a presented plan that's been worked out, thought out, and agreed upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1155)|
| 0:19:22| Thank you. Mr. Cooper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1162)|
| 0:19:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1166)|
| 0:19:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1167)|
| 0:19:32| Dr. Nancy Scott, final time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1172)|
| 0:19:33| I just wanted to make it incredibly clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1173)|
| 0:19:35| As the neighbors, we are 100% happy with one dwelling per unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1175)|
| 0:19:40| And if that is not clear, I do apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1180)|
| 0:19:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1183)|
| 0:19:46| Mr. Bolton, any further remarks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1186)|
| 0:19:53| I want to applaud Mr. Cooper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1193)|
| 0:19:56| He is the only neighbor that I have had two conversations with directly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1196)|
| 0:20:02| and I want to take the opportunity to publicly thank him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1202)|
| 0:20:06| and acknowledge that we've had a very respectful and profitable discussion on my property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1206)|
| 0:20:14| as opposed to others that may have objections to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1214)|
| 0:20:19| Again, if the commission is not willing to accept my request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1219)|
| 0:20:28| I'm offering to postpone and return at a future date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1228)|
| 0:20:34| And I'd like to answer any of your questions if you have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| I will look to my commissioners for any discussion or questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1237)|
| 0:20:43| Commissioner Frazier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1243)|
| 0:20:44| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1244)|
| 0:20:45| Just a comment to the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| With the zoning of PR, there will be a concept plan that you will be able to look at and review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1247)|
| 0:20:53| and it will come before Planning Commission again for approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1253)|
| 0:20:56| and they will put any needed conditions onto the approval of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1256)|
| 0:21:02| Yes, ma'am, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1262)|
| 0:21:09| Seeing no more discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1269)|
| 0:21:11| Commissioner Buehler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1271)|
| 0:21:13| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1273)|
| 0:21:16| Yeah, I mean, it's become clear to me just in the past few days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1276)|
| 0:21:20| that the neighborhood is not comfortable with two dwelling units per acre for a number of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1280)|
| 0:21:28| And I know Mr. Bolton's frustrated because he didn't know that, perhaps, until just recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1288)|
| 0:21:36| and that's kind of the nature of how zonings go sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1296)|
| 0:21:41| We've had some conversations about what you wanted to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1301)|
| 0:21:45| but at the same time, when our constituents reach out to us as elected officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1305)|
| 0:21:49| it's our job to be responsive to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| And sometimes, I mean, we all have busy lives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1311)|
| 0:21:55| and sometimes when someone else is doing something nearby,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1315)|
| 0:21:58| we might not actually come up to the plate until late in the game,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1318)|
| 0:22:03| just because of the way life works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1323)|
| 0:22:06| You know, I think if Mr. Bolton is willing to engage the neighborhood in some conversations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1326)|
| 0:22:12| I wouldn't have a problem with a postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1332)|
| 0:22:16| rather than just arbitrarily saying one or two tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1336)|
| 0:22:22| Do you have a time frame that you would, 30 days, 60 days, how long you would want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1342)|
| 0:22:30| I have a full-time job in Evansville, India.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1350)|
| 0:22:33| As do most of us, yeah, not in Evansville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| And I have to make special arrangements to be here or in my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1355)|
| 0:22:43| Just for the record, my family has owned this property since 1984.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1363)|
| 0:22:48| I've been the primary caretaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1368)|
| 0:22:51| I know the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1371)|
| 0:22:52| I know the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1372)|
| 0:22:54| I don't know all my present neighbors because there's been some turnover,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1374)|
| 0:22:58| and they don't know me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1378)|
| 0:23:00| So I don't mind taking the time to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1380)|
| 0:23:03| I am not comfortable giving you a date as to when that can be achieved and completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1383)|
| 0:23:11| I don't think it's wise for me to spend an effort in developing a plan if it doesn't make sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1391)|
| 0:23:18| and one dwelling unit per acre doesn't make good sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1398)|
| 0:23:24| So I would rather postpone, come up with a number that the neighbors are comfortable with, and return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1404)|
| 0:23:36| I believe I have a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| Well, you certainly have a choice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| but I'm willing to postpone action on this for a time for you to engage with the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1420)|
| 0:23:47| and see if there is a compromise that can be reached, and if there isn't, there isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1427)|
| 0:23:52| But I think it's worth looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1432)|
| 0:23:55| Unfortunately, in order to do a postponement, this body has to postpone to a date certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1435)|
| 0:24:01| Now, if that date, if something happens to where you can't travel on that date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1441)|
| 0:24:05| you can always contact the chairman of the commission or the chairwoman of the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1445)|
| 0:24:11| and request a postponement to a different month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1451)|
| 0:24:16| You do have that option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1456)|
| 0:24:17| I believe one time, am I correct on that, Rules Committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1457)|
| 0:24:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1461)|
| 0:24:23| Right, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| So, if I need to provide a date tonight, what is your June date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1465)|
| 0:24:35| I mean, that's 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1475)|
| 0:24:39| 120 days is the max?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1479)|
| 0:24:43| Yeah, I mean, we could postpone to June, but that's, well, let me see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1483)|
| 0:24:49| No, May would be the longest we are allowed to postpone at one meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1489)|
| 0:24:54| I'd rather ask for that, and if it can be achieved earlier, I'll come back sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1494)|
| 0:24:59| We would have to take action to make it sooner, would we not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1499)|
| 0:25:04| I'll look to the Rules Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1504)|
| 0:25:05| We could vote to add it to the agenda sooner than May, but, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1505)|
| 0:25:11| Well, I'll offer a motion that we postpone this zoning and density on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1511)|
| 0:25:16| until the May zoning meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1516)|
| 0:25:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1518)|
| 0:25:22| Motion is to postpone to the May zoning agenda by Commissioner Beeler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1522)|
| 0:25:29| with a second by Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1529)|
| 0:25:31| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1531)|
| 0:25:32| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| I was going to ask the law for interpretation on page 22 of our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1533)|
| 0:25:38| Section G says that they would have had to ask for a postponement on the Wednesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1538)|
| 0:25:44| prior to this meeting, so would we have to suspend the rules to allow this action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1544)|
| 0:25:50| to move forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1550)|
| 0:25:52| I think that would be correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1552)|
| 0:25:53| It says it's the same rule that we were quoting a minute ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1553)|
| 0:25:56| It says 120 days is as far out as we can go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| Zoning applicants must make a postponement and withdrawal request no later than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1558)|
| 0:26:02| 4 o'clock on the Wednesday in advance of the zoning session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1562)|
| 0:26:06| So I think to postpone it at this point, we would have to both suspend the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1566)|
| 0:26:09| and then it could be postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1569)|
| 0:26:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1571)|
| 0:26:12| Well, which I have no problem with that, but if I may, I feel like this is a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1572)|
| 0:26:17| from a member of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| This is not really a request from the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1579)|
| 0:26:21| Yeah, that's…| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1581)|
| 0:26:28| I'd like to add that I didn't know there was any objections until today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1588)|
| 0:26:32| Well, I was en route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1592)|
| 0:26:35| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1595)|
| 0:26:36| That was going to be my point, that he did not request it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1596)|
| 0:26:39| Commissioner Buehler made it, which as this body, we're allowed to make those choices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1599)|
| 0:26:45| if we want, and he did not request it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1605)|
| 0:26:48| We actually told him when he could come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1608)|
| 0:26:51| So…| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1611)|
| 0:26:52| Just for clarity, I simply asked him if he would be open to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1612)|
| 0:26:55| Yeah, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1615)|
| 0:26:56| Before I made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1616)|
| 0:26:57| You're the one that made the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1617)|
| 0:26:58| So he didn't formally ask the chair for a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1618)|
| 0:27:01| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1621)|
| 0:27:02| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| We did the same thing last month on Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1624)|
| 0:27:15| So the motion on the floor is to postpone to the May zoning meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1635)|
| 0:27:18| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1638)|
| 0:27:19| Seeing none, all those in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1641)|
| 0:27:22| Those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1642)|
| 0:27:23| That motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1643)|
| 0:27:24| We will see you in May, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1644)|
| 0:27:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| Could you give me that date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| It's the 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| 22nd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1651)|
| 0:27:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1652)|

| 0:29:13| I would just split it in half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1753)|
| 0:29:15| Instead of having one acre, it will be two half-acre lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1755)|

| 0:31:08| Planning Commission recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| approve the CB Business and Manufacturing zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1870)|
| 0:31:13| because it is consistent with surrounding development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1873)|
| 0:31:15| by a vote of 12-0, consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1875)|
| 0:31:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1879)|
| 0:31:20| Mr. Mullins, do you wish to speak to this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1880)|
| 0:31:24| Just briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1884)|
| 0:31:25| This is a pretty straightforward rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| except the quirky thing about this one is it's a split zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1887)|
| 0:31:31| Half the property is in the city, CR2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| Half the property is in the county, and it's zoned CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1893)|
| 0:31:36| The CB zone, I think, is more consistent with the city's CR2 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1896)|
| 0:31:41| And so my client wants to put a small distribution center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| for Indian grocery stores in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1905)|
| 0:31:49| So they'll have the Indian food located in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1909)|
| 0:31:53| and he can easily distribute it, and that will require the CB zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1913)|
| 0:31:56| We've worked out with the city and the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1916)|
| 0:31:58| how we would administer building that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1918)|
| 0:32:00| Most of it would be on the county side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| So this zoning just allows him to move forward with his plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| and I did talk to the largest neighbor behind there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1925)|
| 0:32:08| and they have no objections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1928)|
| 0:32:10| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| Commissioners, any questions or discussion regarding this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1932)|
| 0:32:18| Seeing none, I will look to Commission District 3 representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1938)|

| 0:32:24| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1944)|
| 0:32:26| I'll make a motion to approve the CB zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1946)|
| 0:32:29| because it is consistent with the surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1949)|
| 0:32:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=1952)|

| 0:33:51| for the area between 813 contour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| and the current OA Office Park zoning boundary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2033)|

| 0:34:11| Mr. Mullins, would you like to speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| Briefly again, I did send a letter to the Commission on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2053)|
| 0:34:18| just to kind of set the table for the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2058)|
| 0:34:22| It is a very odd piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2062)|
| 0:34:25| It's currently zoned OA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2065)|
| 0:34:27| which is really intended for larger office park-type developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2067)|
| 0:34:31| The request is to move it to OB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2071)|
| 0:34:34| which is more consistent with the size of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2074)|
| 0:34:37| and also gives some flexibility for there to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| potentially some residential use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2080)|
| 0:34:42| in addition to the existing office use that is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2082)|
| 0:34:46| There's a building there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2086)|
| 0:34:49| I think it was originally an old house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| that has been converted to an office use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| There's two businesses there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| and the owners of that building, this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2096)|
| 0:34:59| are my clients, Stephen Hackney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| Landscape Architects and Union Home Mortgage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| Those uses are going to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2103)|
| 0:35:05| What they wanted to do was put two or three small residences there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2105)|
| 0:35:09| that they could use really to house their clients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| when they come in out of town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| and potentially use it for rental units as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2114)|
| 0:35:17| And I sat down with Mr. Reynolds, who's here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2117)|
| 0:35:20| and the planning department to talk through how can this work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2120)|
| 0:35:24| what is a usable area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| really realistically what can we do with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| and really about two or three units is all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2128)|
| 0:35:30| you could probably put on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2130)|
| 0:35:33| There were some questions and comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| at the Planning Commission stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2135)|
| 0:35:38| And that's the reason I wanted to make sure I did a letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2138)|
| 0:35:41| and go back and address those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2141)|
| 0:35:43| There is adequate site distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2143)|
| 0:35:45| There is planned flooding mitigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| that the county is working on as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2147)|
| 0:35:50| that they believe will really address the areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| the flooding concerns that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| And, you know, this zoning is more consistent with the current use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2155)|
| 0:35:59| and it gives some flexibility for residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2159)|
| 0:36:02| And, you know, we believe it's a good rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2162)|
| 0:36:05| It will allow my clients just the ability to come forward with a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2165)|
| 0:36:08| and see what they can do on the property in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2168)|
| 0:36:10| And that's all that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2170)|
| 0:36:11| is just giving them the opportunity to look at it further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2171)|
| 0:36:14| and see if they can use it in more creative ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2174)|
| 0:36:17| So with that, I would ask for this commission's approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2177)|
| 0:36:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2181)|
| 0:36:22| Commissioners, questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2182)|
| 0:36:24| Commissioner Fraser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2186)|
| 0:36:27| Mr. Mullins, were you able to reach out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2187)|
| 0:36:29| to the Keller Bend Homeowners Association?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2189)|
| 0:36:32| They came to the meeting and said they had questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| I tried to follow Ms. Rule out, and she didn't want to talk to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2194)|
| 0:36:38| So maybe she didn't see me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| I don't know if she was walking faster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| But, I mean, she did come, and she had the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| So, you know, if I couldn't talk to her directly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| I at least wanted to answer those questions in this letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| which is what I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| And their concerns are the safety, the blind curve there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2211)|
| 0:36:54| and also maintaining the character of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2214)|
| 0:37:00| How many stories do you think, any new structures or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2220)|
| 0:37:05| Well, the height that's allowed in the OB is 45 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2225)|
| 0:37:09| The height in the OA is 35 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2229)|
| 0:37:12| But with the usable amount of space there, and I go through those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2232)|
| 0:37:16| and I got these numbers from Mr. Reynolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| I don't do math myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| That's why I went to law school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2240)|
| 0:37:22| But Mr. Reynolds said, you know, right now the usable area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2242)|
| 0:37:26| is what's above the 813 contour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| and that's only about 47,000 square feet, a little more than an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2248)|
| 0:37:31| even though it's five acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| To keep the current building on it is about 17,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2253)|
| 0:37:39| is what he asked me, which would leave about 32,000 square feet of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2259)|
| 0:37:42| In the OB zone, each home must have at least 10,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2262)|
| 0:37:46| That's why we got to the, you can only put about three homes there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2266)|
| 0:37:50| in addition to the current use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| So, I mean, without subdividing the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| and this property is not going to be subdivided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2274)|
| 0:37:56| with subdivision regulations, it's just too difficult a piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2276)|
| 0:38:00| So even though the zone would allow there to be more uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2280)|
| 0:38:03| the practical limitations of the property really limit it to what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2283)|
| 0:38:08| Mr. Welch, could you explain to the body about the no-fill line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2288)|
| 0:38:12| and limited rezoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| I'll ask Mr. Reynolds to do that, or Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2295)|
| 0:38:30| Yeah, TVA, although this isn't part of the lake system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| when they established the lake downstream of there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2314)|
| 0:38:37| they did assess an easement to the 813 contour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2317)|
| 0:38:43| So that's kind of what we work off of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| It's a little bit different than a traditional floodway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| along Beaver Creek or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2328)|
| 0:38:50| because it was established by TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2330)|
| 0:38:52| So really the only thing that we're concerned with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2332)|
| 0:38:54| is anything below the 813.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2334)|
| 0:38:59| I will say I do have concerns about the flooding in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2339)|
| 0:39:03| There seem to have been some significant flooding events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2343)|
| 0:39:07| over recent years, so I do take that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2347)|
| 0:39:14| Thank you. Commissioner Skinmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2354)|
| 0:39:16| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| Mr. Snowden, during the event when Hunter Valley Farms was underwater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2358)|
| 0:39:23| was this property also underwater as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2363)|
| 0:39:27| I know you spent a lot of hours around that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2367)|
| 0:39:30| From my recollection, and Mr. Mullins may know better than I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2370)|
| 0:39:34| but this home I think has a daylight basement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2374)|
| 0:39:37| that comes out somewhat lake level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2377)|
| 0:39:40| and I think they did get some water in that lower level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2380)|
| 0:39:43| if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2383)|
| 0:39:46| I'd like to follow up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2386)|
| 0:39:48| The no-fill line actually goes through this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| The existing office did get some flooding in its basement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2390)|
| 0:39:55| You couldn't build it where it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| It's kind of grandfathered in with the regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| But as Mr. Snowden said, with this pump station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2399)|
| 0:40:02| that they're planning to build,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| in addition to repairs to the culvert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| that runs underneath the interstate there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2406)|
| 0:40:08| he thinks that will significantly reduce the risk of future flooding in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2408)|
| 0:40:11| and allow the surface water elevation to be maintained at the current 813.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2411)|
| 0:40:15| I wrote that down directly from Mr. Snowden's planning commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2415)|
| 0:40:20| So we think with the planned improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2420)|
| 0:40:23| that this will definitely help the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2423)|
| 0:40:26| And where these additional residences could go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2426)|
| 0:40:28| would be well above the 813 line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| We're not touching the existing office at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2430)|
| 0:40:33| That's going to remain as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2433)|
| 0:40:39| Any more discussion or questions from the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2439)|
| 0:40:44| Seeing none, I will look to the district commissioner, Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2444)|
| 0:40:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| When I got elected, the first thing I did was go bug Mr. Snowden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2449)|
| 0:40:53| about getting me a pump,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| and I think we're on plan for some time later on this year, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2455)|
| 0:40:58| Mr. Snowden, late this year or early next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2458)|
| 0:41:01| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2461)|
| 0:41:03| We're using some ARPA money for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| which obviously kind of slows that process down a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2465)|
| 0:41:08| We're probably going to actually do two projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2468)|
| 0:41:11| one that will probably start later this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2471)|
| 0:41:13| that will go in and kind of enlarge the size of the culvert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2473)|
| 0:41:19| stabilize it into better condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| and then probably next spring actually install the pumps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2481)|
| 0:41:25| because we need to do the culvert anyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| because the pump system will go through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| So it will kind of be a phase one and phase two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2489)|
| 0:41:32| So the flooding issues, which are very important to my constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2492)|
| 0:41:37| are being addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2497)|
| 0:41:39| and hopefully within the next 18 months will be resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2499)|
| 0:41:43| I'm going to make a recommendation of approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2503)|
| 0:41:46| per Planning Commission recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2506)|
| 0:41:50| or a motion for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2510)|
| 0:41:54| Motion to approve per Planning Commission recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2514)|
| 0:41:57| by Commissioner Ward with a second by Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2517)|
| 0:41:59| Is there any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2519)|
| 0:42:01| Seeing none, all those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2523)|
| 0:42:04| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2524)|
| 0:42:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2525)|
| 0:42:09| That motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2529)|

| 0:43:14| Seeing none, Director Welch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2594)|
| 0:43:16| will you please give us Planning Commission's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2596)|
| 0:43:19| Planning Commission recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| approve the PR plan residential zone at a density of up to 4.2 dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2601)|
| 0:43:25| per acre because it is consistent with the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2605)|
| 0:43:28| and surrounding development by a vote of 13-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2608)|
| 0:43:32| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2612)|
| 0:43:33| Mr. Mullins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2613)|
| 0:43:34| Yes, I do see some neighbors here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2614)|
| 0:43:37| I was retained after Planning Commission vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2617)|
| 0:43:41| The applicant asked for five dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2621)|
| 0:43:44| Planning staff recommended four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| Planning Commission approved for recommendation the 4.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2626)|
| 0:43:50| The reason they went to 4.2 is it's a very small site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2630)|
| 0:43:53| I have Mr. Chibbon and Mr. Harbin here, and Mr. Harbin surveyed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2633)|
| 0:43:58| He surveyed it as 1.95, so it is .05 acres away from two acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2638)|
| 0:44:05| So the 4.2 allows them to be able to put an additional residence on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2645)|
| 0:44:13| Mr. Chibbon owns the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2653)|
| 0:44:14| He's a local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2654)|
| 0:44:15| He lives in District 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2655)|
| 0:44:16| He's a local builder and starting to get into land development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2656)|
| 0:44:21| for some of the properties that he owns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| His parents actually live in the house that is there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2663)|
| 0:44:26| and they are going to remain there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2666)|
| 0:44:29| His concept was with the existing house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2669)|
| 0:44:33| he could put another seven residences there for a total of eight units with the 4.2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2673)|
| 0:44:41| and that's the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| He had originally envisioned having a mix of single-family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2683)|
| 0:44:49| and duplex with there being two duplex units for four, sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2689)|
| 0:44:56| three duplex units for six units plus then the two single-family residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2696)|
| 0:45:01| The neighbors were really concerned about what the duplexes might do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2701)|
| 0:45:04| to the character of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2704)|
| 0:45:07| I did point out that the properties in that area are all zoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2707)|
| 0:45:11| planned residential or RA with the exception of the existing agriculture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2711)|
| 0:45:16| which has been kind of transitioning to low-density residential for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2716)|
| 0:45:20| And both of those zones allow duplexes on a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2720)|
| 0:45:25| But they had some concerns, and I really appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2725)|
| 0:45:29| Ms. Soster organized a community meeting at Grace Lutheran, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2729)|
| 0:45:38| Yes, Grace Lutheran Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2738)|
| 0:45:40| And I and Mr. Chabon went and met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2740)|
| 0:45:43| Probably a couple dozen neighbors were out there and met for a couple hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2743)|
| 0:45:47| talking about the issues and really listened to their concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2747)|
| 0:45:50| And so what we've agreed to do is go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2750)|
| 0:45:53| and look at kind of the difference between what we wanted to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2753)|
| 0:45:57| and what would it be if we made all of those units single-family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2757)|
| 0:46:01| They had some concerns about the site distance, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| there is a curve there, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2764)|
| 0:46:07| there was some concerns about the site distance and engineering raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2767)|
| 0:46:10| And Mr. Harbin went out there and looked at it again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2770)|
| 0:46:13| and he believes we can get the site distance that we would need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2773)|
| 0:46:16| once we move forward with the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| Because no matter what happens in the PR zone, you've got to come forward with the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2778)|
| 0:46:21| You've got to get your site distance certified at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| or you won't be able to do anything anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2783)|
| 0:46:26| There's also some flooding or some runoff concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2786)|
| 0:46:29| I think there's a culvert there that needs some work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2789)|
| 0:46:31| And Mr. Chabon is committed to working on, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2791)|
| 0:46:36| really trying to improve that area, not just maintain the stormwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2796)|
| 0:46:39| that he's going to produce, make sure that the post-development flows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2799)|
| 0:46:43| are equal to or less than what's there now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2803)|
| 0:46:46| but also kind of work maybe redirecting some of that stormwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2806)|
| 0:46:49| to help his neighbors out in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2809)|
| 0:46:52| And he's going to come forward and meet with the neighbors again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2812)|
| 0:46:56| look at the two different plans, and really talk through, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2816)|
| 0:46:59| what that might look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| You know, the impact, whether it's single-family residential or duplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2821)|
| 0:47:06| as far as the infrastructure, are going to be the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2826)|
| 0:47:09| It's really just, you know, what's it going to look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2829)|
| 0:47:12| Is it going to be something that fits in with what they have there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2832)|
| 0:47:15| And we've listened to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| We're going to continue to listen to them about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2837)|
| 0:47:20| So at this stage, you know, it's just the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2840)|
| 0:47:22| We're just asking for 4.2 units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2842)|
| 0:47:25| which is very consistent with what's already out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| R.A. allows for 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2847)|
| 0:47:29| All the other properties are zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2849)|
| 0:47:31| P.R. allows for 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2851)|
| 0:47:32| This is 4.2, just to get that extra unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2852)|
| 0:47:35| which is a very small impact on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2855)|
| 0:47:38| So with that, you know, I'm happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2858)|
| 0:47:42| Mr. Chabon or Mr. Harbin's happy to answer any questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2862)|
| 0:47:44| but we would ask that you approve the Planning Commission's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2864)|
| 0:47:48| of P.R. at 4.2 divided into an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2868)|
| 0:47:52| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2872)|
| 0:47:53| Commissioners, discussion or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2873)|
| 0:47:58| Seeing none, I look to Commissioner from District 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2878)|
| 0:48:02| Commissioner Osher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2882)|
| 0:48:03| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2883)|
| 0:48:05| Let me first say we had a wonderful meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| We probably had 45 people come to the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2887)|
| 0:48:10| Was that many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2890)|
| 0:48:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2891)|
| 0:48:12| And it was a robust meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2892)|
| 0:48:15| and Mr. Chabon really put himself out there, and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2895)|
| 0:48:19| And then he was willing to sit down with me again for an hour to discuss the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2899)|
| 0:48:26| And so I really appreciate that because I know he didn't have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2906)|
| 0:48:31| He hired Mr. Mullins, and Mr. Mullins could have come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2911)|
| 0:48:34| and taken the beating on some of the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2914)|
| 0:48:38| But Mr. Chabon showed up because he is a member of our district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2918)|
| 0:48:42| and so that really meant something to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2922)|
| 0:48:45| And what he's willing to do for the constituents around the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2925)|
| 0:48:51| is really important to me too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| So what I'm going to do is I'm going to make a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2933)|
| 0:48:56| and I'm going to put two conditions in the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2936)|
| 0:48:59| And so if you'll just bear with me so I can get this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2939)|
| 0:49:05| Motion to approve planned residential with a density of 4.2 units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2945)|
| 0:49:10| subject to two conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| One, applicant will provide two design plans for review and discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2952)|
| 0:49:17| and then we'll have another meeting with surrounding neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2957)|
| 0:49:21| And two, applicant will provide stormwater prevention improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| identified by adjacent property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2964)|
| 0:49:28| So that is my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2970)|
| 0:49:35| Motion on the floor is to approve PR, planned residential zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=2975)|

| 0:51:19| Mr. Cross, would you like to speak to your project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3079)|
| 0:51:22| I'm the project surveyor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3082)|
| 0:51:23| It's a very basic deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3083)|
| 0:51:25| There's two homes existing on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3085)|
| 0:51:28| It's a current agricultural zoning to subdivide each individual house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3088)|
| 0:51:33| which works in harmony with everything around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3093)|
| 0:51:37| We're requesting an RA zoning as per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3097)|
| 0:51:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3102)|
| 0:51:43| Commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3103)|
| 0:51:44| Commissioner Frazier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3104)|
| 0:51:45| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3105)|
| 0:51:46| Just wanted to ask the applicant, are you aware that this parcel is in the town of Farragut urban growth boundary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3106)|
| 0:51:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3112)|
| 0:51:53| Okay, so I don't see any problems, but I just wanted to bring this to your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3113)|
| 0:51:58| I wanted to point out that if this lot is subdivided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3118)|
| 0:52:02| then the right-of-way should be dedicated for future improvements of Campbell Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3122)|
| 0:52:07| So if you want to add an access, that will need to be approved by the Farragut Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3127)|
| 0:52:12| as this is part of the North Campbell Station Road improvements, and it is the town's right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3132)|
| 0:52:20| So since this is a minor arterial, the right-of-way required from the center line of the road is 40 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3140)|
| 0:52:26| So that's some information you'll probably want to follow up on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3146)|
| 0:52:30| Yes, I was very unaware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3150)|
| 0:52:32| Where does that urban growth stop and start in that vicinity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3152)|
| 0:52:39| Mr. Reynolds, Mr. Snowden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| Everything that's available to me, it's black and white.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3161)|
| 0:52:44| Either it's in Farragut or it's not in Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| Right, right. I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| I'm going to let you speak to that, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3168)|
| 0:52:51| Sure. The Farragut town border is essentially the entire North Campbell Station Road right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3171)|
| 0:53:00| So the urban growth boundary is on the north side of North Campbell Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3180)|
| 0:53:08| So the property is not in Farragut, but it is in the urban growth boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3188)|
| 0:53:12| Everything applies as the Knox County zoning regulations and everything for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3192)|
| 0:53:18| If anybody has any questions or clarifications, I'll be happy to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| So you seem to know more than anybody about this, Ms. Fraser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3201)|
| 0:53:26| So how will this impact me subdividing this into two lots and having a driveway for each individual lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3206)|
| 0:53:32| That's something you need to speak with the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3212)|
| 0:53:35| Their planning commission office can help guide you through that and explain to you the expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3215)|
| 0:53:41| So it's to make you aware it doesn't impact our voting here, but as an applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3221)|
| 0:53:46| I just wanted you to be aware that if you want to subdivide or add an additional access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3226)|
| 0:53:51| that you will also need to go through the town of Farragut's process as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3231)|
| 0:53:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3236)|
| 0:53:59| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3239)|
| 0:54:01| Thank you, Madam Chair. I just want some clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3241)|
| 0:54:04| Maybe you just need to repeat it and I need to listen slower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3244)|
| 0:54:08| How is it that if it's not in the town of Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3248)|
| 0:54:10| the town of Farragut has jurisdiction over a property owner outside of the town of Farragut?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3250)|
| 0:54:14| So the right-of-way is in the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| So if they request a driveway permit, they have to get the permit through Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3257)|
| 0:54:21| It's just the right-of-way portion, so that's not a full overlay on the whole plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3261)|
| 0:54:25| Okay. Thank you. I just want to make sure I heard that correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3265)|
| 0:54:28| Just to add to this, there was laws that were just recently passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3268)|
| 0:54:33| that right-of-way dedication is no longer required for project approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3273)|
| 0:54:41| Yes, that is the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3281)|
| 0:54:43| There was a state law that allowed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3283)|
| 0:54:45| How the town of Farragut is interpreting that and implementing that law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3285)|
| 0:54:49| would just be something you'll need to discuss with the town of Farragut, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3289)|
| 0:54:52| Understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3292)|
| 0:54:55| Thank you. Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3295)|
| 0:54:59| Seeing none, I'll look to the District Commissioner, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3299)|

| 0:58:37| Yeah, I appreciate y'all's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3517)|
| 0:58:38| This is a .84 piece that surrounds a piece that y'all rezoned at four units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3518)|

| 0:58:53| And NBC unanimously approved the four units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3533)|
| 0:58:59| Everything around it is four units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3539)|
| 0:59:00| This is .84 acres surrounded by the 23 plus or minus acres surrounding it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3540)|

| 0:59:14| When we came to NBC, based on our density, we said, okay, we're good with four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3554)|
| 0:59:20| because that's all we could get on the property anyways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3560)|
| 0:59:22| And with this particular piece, we would only need 3.5 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3562)|
| 0:59:27| So if it's the will of the commission, we would go with 3.5 units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3567)|
| 0:59:31| which NBC approved at four, but we don't need that density of four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3571)|

| 0:59:40| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3580)|

| 0:59:44| Mr. Snowden, are there any road improvements that need to be there from that last rezoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3584)|
| 0:59:52| My understanding that we'll have one come up next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3592)|
| 0:59:56| where it was agreed by Mr. Davis and Mr. Smith to share cost on a turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3596)|
| 1:00:01| I just want to make sure that this time that they don't want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3601)|
| 1:00:05| I want to make sure this time we have it in writing that if there's any cost sharing that's got to be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3605)|
| 1:00:10| it's in writing this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3610)|
| 1:00:12| And I may ask Mr. Reynolds, I can't recall if the traffic study contemplated any off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3612)|
| 1:00:17| I don't believe it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3617)|
| 1:00:18| I don't believe there was any left turn lanes or any offside improvements required as part of this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3618)|
| 1:00:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3625)|
| 1:00:26| I'll have some more discussion next month on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3626)|
| 1:00:30| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3630)|
| 1:00:34| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3634)|
| 1:00:38| Seeing none, I will look to our District 3 commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3638)|
| 1:00:43| I feel like this is just District 3 zoning night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3643)|
| 1:00:46| It's like one after the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3646)|
| 1:00:50| I appreciate Mr. Davis coming down and dropping what he was asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3650)|
| 1:00:56| I'm going to go to the three units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3656)|
| 1:01:08| I'm going to go to the three units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3668)|
| 1:01:11| Reason being, and I know that there were four on the other, but I have heard from many, many constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3671)|
| 1:01:18| that they're just concerned with more density on that area and on that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3678)|
| 1:01:25| And so that's where I'm laying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3685)|
| 1:01:29| So my motion would be to approve the PR zone at a density of three units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3689)|
| 1:01:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3700)|
| 1:01:44| Motion to approve PR zone for three units an acre by Commissioner Oster with a second by Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3704)|
| 1:01:55| Is there any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3715)|
| 1:01:59| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3719)|
| 1:02:00| Did you ask for 3.5 or 3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3720)|
| 1:02:03| I thought you said 3.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3723)|
| 1:02:04| Yeah, we originally asked for 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3724)|
| 1:02:09| This is a 23 to 24 acre track of land that you all approved in December for 40 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3729)|
| 1:02:19| There's a .84 piece of property that fronts Fox Road that we inadvertently left that piece off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3739)|
| 1:02:28| which is where the house was when we did the original application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3748)|
| 1:02:32| So all the property surrounding this .84 piece you all already approved for four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3752)|
| 1:02:39| So whatever .84 times 3.5 is what we would need to get the density to meet what the concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3759)|
| 1:02:53| which has already been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3773)|
| 1:02:55| So I would respectfully request MPC approved four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3775)|
| 1:02:59| I would respectfully request from you all a density of 3.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3779)|
| 1:03:03| I'll make a substitute motion for 3.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3783)|
| 1:03:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3787)|
| 1:03:10| Substitute motion by Commissioner Ward to approve PR zone at 3.5 units an acre with a second by Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3790)|
| 1:03:21| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3801)|
| 1:03:22| Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3802)|
| 1:03:25| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3805)|
| 1:03:26| I don't want to put Commissioner Oster on the spot, but going back to that meeting, the motion was three by Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3806)|
| 1:03:34| Then it was a substitute motion to four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3814)|
| 1:03:37| Commissioner Oster might have got confused on how the vote was going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3817)|
| 1:03:41| It should have been three at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3821)|
| 1:03:44| That's the way I saw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3824)|
| 1:03:46| I think it should have been at three and still should be three today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3826)|
| 1:03:50| Commissioner Oster did get confused on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3830)|
| 1:03:52| It was her first zoning meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3832)|
| 1:03:55| So I'm going to stick to three, and I respectfully respect the fact that Commissioner Ward made a substitute motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3835)|
| 1:04:01| and see how it plays out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3841)|
| 1:04:07| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3847)|
| 1:04:09| Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3849)|
| 1:04:12| So how many more dwellings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3852)|
| 1:04:14| What is the difference in that half?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3854)|
| 1:04:17| I think it's one difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3857)|
| 1:04:20| You guys are better at math than I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3860)|
| 1:04:23| 0.84 times three is 2.52, and then 0.84 times 3.5 is 2.94.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3863)|
| 1:04:35| So it's a half of a house difference, but with the acreage, we're talking about one additional unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3875)|
| 1:04:44| So that's why the 3.5 we could live with, because we're talking about one additional unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3884)|
| 1:04:51| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=3891)|

| 1:18:19| It's a planned, master plan, multi-generational development that when we bought the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=4699)|

| 1:18:45| on the front end that, again, checked all the boxes, that we show you the picture. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=4725)|
| 1:18:51| think through every single thing that we could possibly think through, not everything, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=4731)|
| 1:18:55| that's going to be pointed out tonight, but the majority of things. We're excited about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=4735)|

| 1:19:05| about this. I've had more opposition at a 20-acre zoning of 30 units an acre than I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=4745)|
| 1:19:12| have on a 1,100-unit planned development. So obviously, yes, I know we have opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=4752)|
| 1:19:20| but at the same time, even I think we've quieted some of the opposition with what we're, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=4760)|
| 1:19:25| we're giving and what we're willing to do. For the first time ever, we are in front of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=4765)|

| 1:21:37| that we think was something that the community deserves. I think we want to have a staple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=4897)|

| 1:21:46| land. I think there's four that you could do this size of development on in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=4906)|
| 1:21:50| and this is one of them. This is something, thinking outside the box, it might be a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=4910)|
| 1:21:53| advanced for today, and it might be more geared towards advanced Knox once it's out, but we'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=4913)|

| 1:22:45| Hi, my name is Julie McBee Fritz. I live in the Karnes community. I think you all know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=4965)|
| 1:22:50| me by now. But anyway, I am not here to completely oppose the development. I know it's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=4970)|
| 1:23:00| to happen. I've been here since 2019, and there's not been but one Smithville development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=4980)|
| 1:23:09| that was shut down, and then it was approved after a new entrance had been made in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=4989)|

| 1:23:20| I would like to touch on something for just a moment. I was presented to the Metropolitan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5000)|
| 1:23:27| Planning Commission, and I have to tell you, I don't know if y'all can do anything or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5007)|
| 1:23:32| but that process definitely needs to be changed. Five minutes exactly, I was shut down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5012)|
| 1:23:40| There were questions for Mr. Sanderson, 45 minutes. Meeting after meeting after meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5020)|
| 1:23:49| they had for him. I'm public. I'm not a developer. So I'm like, why wasn't I given the chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5029)|
| 1:23:58| to speak as well? There were several questions. There were some things we don't know. We don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5038)|
| 1:24:03| know. So they're asking you to approve a plan, and the answer is, I don't know. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5043)|
| 1:24:09| therefore, after it gets approved, then we'll worry about it. The same thing is listed on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5049)|
| 1:24:15| here as well. So I did not appreciate that as a citizen of this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5055)|
| 1:24:22| The other thing is, the Smith boys need our support. I know that you really need to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5062)|
| 1:24:30| that in an open forum, because I know there are people that are 100% for the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5070)|
| 1:24:40| and especially for Mr. Rocky Smith and for Josh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5080)|
| 1:24:46| The other thing is, my husband's family has a cemetery there, which is a Revolutionary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5086)|

| 1:25:09| documented from the Metropolitan Planning Commission, and it was brought up about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5109)|
| 1:25:15| care and how that cemetery is going to be taken care of. I spoke to Josh. He was a veteran| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5115)|
| 1:25:23| of the war. He was kind enough to come and talk to our community, which many people did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5123)|
| 1:25:27| show up. I know some of our commissioners for that district were not available, so Josh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5127)|
| 1:25:32| and I went ahead and did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5132)|
| 1:25:35| He gave me—and would you all pull up the design, if you have that? Literally, the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5135)|
| 1:25:41| was that the cemetery was going to be taken and developed around with two different home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5141)|
| 1:25:48| sites. You had to literally go in the entrance, circle around, I guess, a street or two, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5148)|
| 1:25:55| there's the cemetery. Fence, square, that's it. If you wanted to get to it, you'd park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5155)|

| 1:26:05| This community can have a great historical site with that cemetery there. I am in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5165)|
| 1:26:12| process of trying to set up a nonprofit organization so that cemetery can be taken care of. This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5172)|
| 1:26:21| is not to be disrespectful to Mr. Rocky Smith or to Josh Sanderson. That cemetery looks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5181)|
| 1:26:28| like T total you know what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5188)|

| 1:27:15| Josh said something about the HOA, and I think that's probably for the park that's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5235)|
| 1:27:20| to be on the south side on Emory, but I want that cemetery taken care of. That's it. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5240)|

| 1:27:36| with that, and if nothing else comes from this meeting, if y'all can do it, I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5256)|
| 1:27:43| it done. My husband wants it done. His other cousins and other family members want it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5263)|

| 1:29:17| I said, I want to know what's going to happen with this park. Mr. Sanderson, when he presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5357)|
| 1:29:22| they're going to give $5 from the HOA to help take care of this park. I wanted to figure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5362)|
| 1:29:30| as to how much money Knox County pays to keep a park up. Never got it. Never got it. Still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5370)|

| 1:29:50| I think the county's going to end up spending a whole lot more money than $5,500 that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5390)|
| 1:29:57| development's going to bring in. Let me see. I know that many of you all are excited about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5397)|
| 1:30:06| this plan for this development because it's new. It brings in, I don't know how many people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5406)|
| 1:30:13| how many kids, tax money. I get that. We live in a county that has absolutely exploded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5413)|
| 1:30:19| We still are 30 to 40 years back from having our communities updated. You all know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5419)|
| 1:30:27| the story that have been here about where I live and our road conditions, so I will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5427)|
| 1:30:31| not get into that again. But we have got to take care of our communities that are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5431)|
| 1:30:39| You're asking the people that live in these communities to just say, oh, well, sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5439)|
| 1:30:45| you're going to get it anyway. Doesn't matter about the people that are already there that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5445)|
| 1:30:49| are suffering. We're going to bring more people in that are not from here. I'm almost done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5449)|
| 1:30:58| What's that? Oh, the traffic study. In here, they're going to do another traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5458)|
| 1:31:07| Why? Already done one. I know that they're responsible for the payment, the bill for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5467)|
| 1:31:12| the traffic study. The average speed on that particular part of road, guess what it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5472)|

| 1:31:34| study was, 70 miles per hour. They are proposing a red light at their entrance. I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5494)|
| 1:31:46| that. But let me tell you something. There's not going to be a whole lot of people that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5506)|
| 1:31:52| are going to turn off Clinton Highway and not gun it down Emory Road to go all the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5512)|
| 1:31:59| to Carnes to guess where? Harrell and Carpenter and West Emory. This will be the fourth development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5519)|
| 1:32:08| Number four. Mr. Smith has already started on his condos literally right beside the homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5528)|
| 1:32:16| that we were here on Beaver Ridge. Can't think of the name of it. But anyway, four developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5536)|
| 1:32:22| Okay. Don't you think that's a little much right now? We're crammed. We can't take anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5542)|
| 1:32:31| So there's some ideas. Those are some things I wanted to discuss. I don't know how you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5551)|
| 1:32:38| all are going to vote, but I would please ask you to think about these considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5558)|
| 1:32:44| There are several more, but for time constraints, that's all I have. Thank you all very much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5564)|
| 1:32:49| for your time. Sir, please state your name and address for the record and please keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5569)|
| 1:33:00| your comments as brief as possible. I will. My name is Gail Engelke, 7401 Harvest Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5580)|
| 1:33:08| Lane, Powell, Tennessee. And I want to speak to this as almost an outsider. I moved here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5588)|
| 1:33:14| from Seattle in 2000 and met my lovely bride, Rhonda Harvin. I'm really speaking for her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5594)|
| 1:33:23| She grew up in this community. And I came to Knoxville from Seattle on a job working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5603)|
| 1:33:29| with the HGTV when Scripps Howard bought it and spent a couple of months in this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5609)|
| 1:33:35| back in the 90s. And I said, you know, when I retire, this is where I'm going because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5615)|
| 1:33:41| these people are lovely and this is a lovely community and I love Knox County. And what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5621)|
| 1:33:48| I wanted to say about the development that's going on in North Knox County is that it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5628)|
| 1:33:55| changed so much. My wife has seen it more than I have, but we bought a parcel that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5635)|
| 1:34:02| actually zoned, that was zoned residential when we purchased it. We rezoned it agriculture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5642)|
| 1:34:10| for our horse farm for tax purposes, obviously. And Bell Ranch, my friend Billy used to run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5650)|
| 1:34:19| cattle on there for the last 20 years. He was run off of there for this upcoming development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5659)|
| 1:34:26| My friend Vernon Gordon, his hay fields were bought up by Smithbilt. My hay bill has gone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5666)|
| 1:34:33| from $3.50 a bale to $12 a bale. So these are actual effects on residents of the de-agriculture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5673)|
| 1:34:43| nest, however you want to say it, that's going on in this county. And it can't be stopped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5683)|
| 1:34:49| because people are moving here for the same reasons I moved here, because it's a lovely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5689)|
| 1:34:54| community and lovely people. I remember when I first moved here, I was standing in a grocery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5694)|
| 1:34:58| store line and somebody behind me was talking and it took me a few minutes to realize they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5698)|
| 1:35:03| were talking to me. And then because people were just that friendly and just that lovely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5703)|
| 1:35:10| And so people aren't going to stop coming here, we know that. But I'm afraid with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5710)|
| 1:35:14| development coming in, and we're talking about the population of Oliver Springs being dropped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5714)|
| 1:35:21| in to North County, North Knox County, right adjacent to our property, nearly. And Smithbilt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5721)|
| 1:35:29| just finished a property to the west of us. We had to acquire 10 acres between that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5729)|
| 1:35:34| and our property as a buffer. We were fortunate enough to be able to do that. But things are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5734)|
| 1:35:41| moving way too fast. I don't know if you've been down Clinton Highway and tried to turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5741)|
| 1:35:46| on to Emory Road. Currently, traffic can back up all the way to Wal-Mart as it stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5746)|
| 1:35:53| And if you come up that road and turn down Emory Road and go one mile and they're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5753)|
| 1:35:59| to put a stoplight in, I can't imagine what that's going to do to that intersection. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5759)|
| 1:36:05| that needs to be thought through very, very seriously. Because right now, it's absolutely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5765)|
| 1:36:12| somebody opened the barn door and they're coming through. The other thing on this piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5772)|
| 1:36:17| of property is that along the creek, the blue way down there is fantastic that they've opened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5777)|
| 1:36:24| that creek up. We just love it. We live on the creek. But we've got to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5784)|
| 1:36:29| there's a corridor for wildlife maintained along that creek. And so I'm just asking that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5789)|
| 1:36:37| that be addressed and the traffic be addressed. Otherwise, I mean, you're not going to stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5797)|
| 1:36:42| people moving here because it's a wonderful, wonderful community. And I've lived everywhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5802)|
| 1:36:47| in this country. And I've decided to retire here. And other people are going to do the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5807)|
| 1:36:53| same. But anyway, just consider the wildlife corridor, your traffic situation. And that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5813)|
| 1:37:00| really all I have. So thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5820)|
| 1:37:03| Thank you. Mr. Sanderson? Any additional comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5823)|
| 1:37:11| I have no additional comments. I'm here for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5831)|
| 1:37:14| All right. I'll look to commissioners for questions and discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5834)|

| 1:37:31| Josh and the SmithBuilt team for taking a chance and really trial by fire kind of going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5851)|
| 1:37:38| into this plan development. I was a part of the creation of the plan development ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5858)|
| 1:37:42| And the intent was to bring more creative development so that we would build better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5862)|
| 1:37:49| communities and we could take into consideration everything that should be considered on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5869)|
| 1:37:56| front end. And so we get more of a holistic picture of what we should expect and what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5876)|
| 1:38:03| we want to occur in a development. And as you might expect, Mr. Sanderson, I have taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5883)|
| 1:38:10| some time and really looked through your proposal. And I have to say, for really having no parameters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5890)|
| 1:38:18| of what to bring forward to planning commission and then to this body, I have to say you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5898)|
| 1:38:25| did a really exemplary job in this proposal in providing much of the information that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5905)|
| 1:38:32| we need to really start the conversation of what we want to see in this. Also, you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5912)|
| 1:38:40| done a great job with addressing questions and concerns along the way. I know you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5920)|
| 1:38:45| been very open with communication, with meeting with the public. And I truly appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5925)|
| 1:38:53| I've told Josh before, I'm not trying to beat you up. And I've actually told our county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5933)|
| 1:38:57| staff, I'm not trying to be difficult. I'm just really trying to be responsible. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5937)|
| 1:39:05| you had kind of a, you say it's a cheesy analogy, you know, mine to the staff and to just those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5945)|
| 1:39:13| in conversation was this is very much to me, from a fiscal standpoint, like someone saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5953)|
| 1:39:22| you're going to buy a car. You don't get to pick the make, model, and year, but you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5962)|
| 1:39:28| got to pay for it. And so I take that very seriously. Also, I know you mentioned you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5968)|
| 1:39:35| want to move forward and you don't want to, we don't need more conditions. And you used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5975)|
| 1:39:40| the marriage analysis. The reason that we feel or I feel that I have to impose conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5980)|
| 1:39:48| is because one, this is, it's very fluid. The second is cheesy. We've married you and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5988)|
| 1:39:58| then we got cheated on. I don't want to be cheated on again. The citizens of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=5998)|
| 1:40:06| don't want to be cheated on again. And so that's why we have to really seriously consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6006)|
| 1:40:13| conditions. And again, we want to work with you, but we also want to work with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6013)|
| 1:40:21| Those that have lived and contributed to our tax base for decades, their voice should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6021)|
| 1:40:29| valued as well. And I think that we can do that in a very respectable way and still really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6029)|
| 1:40:36| produce a good development for the community. And so in saying all of that, I have put forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6036)|
| 1:40:46| additional conditions. There's 18 of them. I don't know if the body wants me to read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6046)|

| 1:48:46| better than anybody. We've got less than 3,000 houses on the MLS at this point. I would say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6526)|

| 1:49:39| that's new and innovative, and what Smithbilt has brought to us is new and innovative. Now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6579)|
| 1:49:45| what comes with new and innovation is scary. There's a lot of maybe unanswered questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6585)|
| 1:49:51| There's questions that we may not even know that we have. There may be questions that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6591)|
| 1:49:56| Smithbilt's going to run into that they never knew that they were going to have because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6596)|
| 1:49:59| this is going to be a new project. We are walking through this together. I like the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6599)|

| 1:50:16| like is important for people to hear. You know, the county needs more businesses in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6616)|
| 1:50:22| the county. When the city years ago decided to finger annex everything, we lost a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6622)|
| 1:50:30| of tax base, and our citizens have had to make up for that. If you have businesses in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6630)|
| 1:50:36| the county, you are getting that tax base, and it's not going to the city. That to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6636)|
| 1:50:41| is huge. So if we have a restaurant or two restaurants at Belltown, and we have whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6641)|
| 1:50:47| else goes in there shopping-wise, that business tax is actually coming to the county, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6647)|
| 1:50:52| is actually taking a burden off of our county citizens because we don't want to raise taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6652)|
| 1:50:59| So those are things I think sometimes people don't think about. I also want to say to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6659)|
| 1:51:04| people who have been here, because I have lived in Knox County all my life, and we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6664)|
| 1:51:11| in a growing spurt, and I'm going to use kind of an analogy also, Mr. Sanderson, that when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6671)|
| 1:51:17| churches want to grow, they have a tendency of pushing the old people out to bring in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6677)|
| 1:51:22| the new people. But we don't want to do that in Knox County. We want to be respectful of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6682)|
| 1:51:27| our people who have been here for 20 or 30 years, paid into the tax base, but we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6687)|
| 1:51:32| to be able to bring in the other people, because we can't put a wall around Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6692)|
| 1:51:36| They're coming, and they're coming in droves, and we have to put them somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6696)|
| 1:51:41| So the idea of Belltown is innovative. It's new. I know that there are going to be some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6701)|
| 1:51:47| issues that come down the pike, but we deal with those issues any time that we do a PR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6707)|

| 1:52:04| and we want to be able to have more Belltowns throughout the county. Like I say, it's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6724)|
| 1:52:10| to bring in more tax dollars. It's going to bring in more business dollars. So I'm excited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6730)|
| 1:52:15| about it. I thank Josh. He has met with me a few times. He came to the Carnes meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6735)|

| 1:52:37| and new. I know it's been a trial, and I've heard from people in District 6, not in my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6757)|
| 1:52:46| district, but after I'm able to talk to them, there's been a lot of understanding of why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6766)|
| 1:52:52| I would support this. So I just want to thank you for doing this. Put yourself out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6772)|
| 1:53:00| Thank you, Commissioner Oster. Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6780)|
| 1:53:03| Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Reynolds, when you developed your staff report to give it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6783)|
| 1:53:11| to the Planning Commissioners, your staff recommendation was postpone the Belltown preliminary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6791)|
| 1:53:18| plan until the January 12, 2023 Planning Commission meeting. Why was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6798)|
| 1:53:26| Well, we were still waiting on additional information from the applicant, Mr. Sanderson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6806)|
| 1:53:34| and we weren't ready to make a recommendation one way or the other. Mr. Sanderson did work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6814)|
| 1:53:42| hard to address concerns that we had. By the time at getting closer to the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6822)|
| 1:53:48| meeting, there's really not a lot of time to change. Recommendations did provide conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6828)|
| 1:53:55| of approval to the Planning Commission if they did want to move forward with it versus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6835)|
| 1:53:59| the postponement recommendation. That's how we came to where we were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6839)|
| 1:54:06| So did you actually give a recommendation, a verbal recommendation then to the Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6846)|
| 1:54:11| Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6851)|
| 1:54:12| I provided a written list of potential conditions to consider for the Planning Commission so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6852)|
| 1:54:19| that they had something to work with if they wanted to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6859)|
| 1:54:22| Okay, so that was the 11 conditions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6862)|
| 1:54:26| I think we provided 9, and there's, I believe, 2 additional conditions were provided by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6866)|
| 1:54:31| Planning Commissioners added, 2 additional conditions, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6871)|
| 1:54:34| Okay, so the planning staff recommended approval of the project pending the 9?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6874)|
| 1:54:42| Conditions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6882)|
| 1:54:43| Approximately, yeah, I believe that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6883)|
| 1:54:49| Okay. Let's see, Mr. Snowden, do you have Exhibit A in front of you, the 11 conditions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6889)|
| 1:55:02| Hang on one second, I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6902)|
| 1:55:07| If you would look at, for instance, number 2, when you say partnering with Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6907)|
| 1:55:14| to implement the recommendation, recommending improvements to the West Emory Road and Clinton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6914)|
| 1:55:19| Highway intersection, what does partnering mean? You don't say 50-50 split, 70-30 split,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6919)|
| 1:55:29| what is partnering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6929)|
| 1:55:32| What I would envision that to be would, obviously, the expenditure of any public funds would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6932)|
| 1:55:38| have to come in front of this body. We would, to try to make it as equitable as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6938)|
| 1:55:45| take the traffic study that was provided by them, by the applicant, and confer that information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6945)|
| 1:55:53| and make sure we agree with it, and then base our, I guess, cost share off of that, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6953)|
| 1:56:00| some of that traffic is existing today that is occurring outside of their development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6960)|
| 1:56:06| So that would be, I guess, my first suggestion to move forward with the condition number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6966)|
| 1:56:13| 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6973)|
| 1:56:15| But they could come back and say, we don't agree with your analysis and refuse to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6975)|
| 1:56:23| I mean, yeah, that's a possibility, obviously, but we would certainly try to work with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6983)|
| 1:56:31| in every fair fashion. It's been my interpretation with dealing with them in the past that they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6991)|
| 1:56:36| been a good partner with ours in instances like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6996)|
| 1:56:39| Okay, because I believe Commissioner Daly, earlier in the meeting, brought up about a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=6999)|
| 1:56:46| developer who did renege on the road improvements for their project, and that the taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7006)|
| 1:56:53| are going to be, end up footing the bill for that. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7013)|
| 1:56:59| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7019)|
| 1:57:00| And then, so, even number 3, you just say the developer will provide funding, but you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7020)|
| 1:57:08| don't, there is no financial requirement that doesn't say what the percentage is or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7028)|
| 1:57:16| It just says...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7036)|
| 1:57:21| So do you see what I'm saying? And on some of these, it's just kind of left up to interpretation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7041)|
| 1:57:29| as far as whether they will or will not have to follow the 11 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7049)|
| 1:57:38| And I would add, in this particular instance, both the roads that are being impacted are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7058)|
| 1:57:45| state routes. They're not county routes. So TDOT is going to be driving a lot of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7065)|
| 1:57:51| boat, so I would think that, you know, TDOT is going to require somebody to make these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7071)|
| 1:58:00| improvements, so I would envision that TDOT would have a big say in how that gets done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7080)|
| 1:58:06| as well that could assist in these conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7086)|
| 1:58:12| And then, do you have the completed signed traffic impact analysis study in your possession| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7092)|
| 1:58:20| at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7100)|
| 1:58:23| We do not, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7103)|
| 1:58:29| Mr. Sanderson, when you and I met, I had discussed with you on how I understood the traffic impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7109)|
| 1:58:36| analysis study. I understood what a town center concept is and support the idea of a concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7116)|
| 1:58:43| like what you've proposed here with single family residential apartments, townhomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7123)|
| 1:58:52| and commercial activity. I think one of the reasons the one that's most well-known didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7132)|
| 1:59:00| do as well as it could is it didn't have enough land to start with. You have less than 125| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7140)|
| 1:59:09| acres to start with. It's hard to do a true town center concept. But as I said in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7149)|
| 1:59:16| work session, I believe before we sign off on a development that we need to have all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7156)|
| 1:59:23| of the paperwork in our hands so we're able to make an informed decision. And that's why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7163)|
| 1:59:34| I think there's also something else we're missing from our paperwork as well as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7174)|
| 1:59:38| traffic study. Do you know of anything else, Mr. Snowden, or Mr. Reynolds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7178)|
| 1:59:46| I believe the traffic study was the biggest remaining item that I recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7186)|
| 1:59:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7194)|
| 1:59:56| Thank you. Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7196)|
| 1:59:58| I'll let Commissioner Daley go before me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7198)|
| 2:00:01| Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7201)|
| 2:00:02| Are you sure? Because I'm going to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7202)|
| 2:00:10| I'll go first then. I'm very excited about this development personally. This is what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7210)|
| 2:00:20| we've been asking for. You have every level of socioeconomic housing available for a community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7220)|
| 2:00:28| a community that we need, you know, 10,000 houses. Housing prices are going through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7228)|
| 2:00:34| roof. This helps let teachers, cops, nurses all be able to afford and stay in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7234)|
| 2:00:41| that they love. Having the additional tax revenue from the commercial side definitely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7241)|
| 2:00:47| helps. We've always talked about more town centers. In my district, we have North Shore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7247)|
| 2:00:52| Town Center, which everybody in my district loves. It makes it very convenient and easy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7252)|
| 2:00:56| for us to get to the kind of stuff that we like. I personally live in Rocky Hill, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7256)|
| 2:01:02| I live 30 seconds from the Rocky Hill Center. It's awesome. I'll never live anywhere else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7262)|
| 2:01:07| again because it's just so easy to go down the street and go to Butler and Bailey's or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7267)|
| 2:01:11| go have breakfast or something like that. I think, Josh, you've probably spent hundreds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7271)|
| 2:01:17| of thousands of dollars already getting to this point. You've jumped through a million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7277)|
| 2:01:20| hoops. I can personally tell you that every developer and every contractor in town is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7280)|
| 2:01:25| watching this right now. My phone's been blowing up all night already, and I think we've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7285)|
| 2:01:30| talking about this project for months on end. The big thing is this is what we've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7290)|
| 2:01:36| asking for. Unfortunately, Josh is going through the ringer trying to do this. In my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7296)|
| 2:01:44| this is definitely a legacy piece for you and your uncle and for your company. The rest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7304)|
| 2:01:50| of the community for the builders is trying to see, well, is it worth us putting this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7310)|
| 2:01:55| much effort and spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to try to accomplish something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7315)|
| 2:02:00| that's unique and interesting and advanced? We kind of still do things like it's 20, 30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7320)|
| 2:02:10| years ago, especially when it comes to planning and development. I know the mayor's been really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7330)|
| 2:02:15| big on pushing, trying to redo all of our zoning and all of our plans to try to create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7335)|
| 2:02:22| more opportunities like this. I know in the 8th District, they want a town center out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7342)|
| 2:02:27| eventually. I know in South Knoxville, Commissioner Daley's always talking about, hey, we need growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7347)|
| 2:02:31| so we can bring in the different amenities that we need. This is part of that example right here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7351)|
| 2:02:36| of good development with parks and everything that you'd want. I'm going to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7356)|
| 2:02:44| I've got to read it since it has to be done very specifically. A motion to approve the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7364)|
| 2:02:51| preliminary plan including the requested exceptions to the A agricultural zone dimensional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7371)|
| 2:02:56| standards and permitted uses subject to 11 conditions because the exceptions requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7376)|
| 2:03:02| satisfy 6.80.05.B and the standards for plan development have been met per 6.80.06.C.5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7382)|
| 2:03:13| and sentence. So that's my motion. Second. I'm not going to repeat that. Okay. The motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7393)|
| 2:03:32| on the floor is to approve per hour, per planning and per hour legal documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7412)|
| 2:03:41| that Commissioner Ward just read with a second by Commissioner Daley. Commissioner Jay, your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7421)|
| 2:03:46| light is on. Thank you, Madam Chair. I'm not sure who wants to take this, but help me understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7426)|
| 2:03:55| the traffic study. It's just very vague in the 11 conditions. Is it the revised traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7435)|
| 2:04:05| study is required before this body is to consider its approval or before the concept plan is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7445)|
| 2:04:12| resubmitted? It's not done, correct? So when is the condition, what is the condition? That| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7452)|
| 2:04:25| it be done before we hear it or before it goes to the concept? It's my understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7465)|
| 2:04:32| that the traffic study shall be completed and reviewed by planning staff and engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7472)|
| 2:04:37| staff prior to planning commission approving the final plan or the concept plan. Okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7477)|
| 2:04:47| so before the final concept plan goes back for the last looks, it has to be done and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=7487)|

| 2:16:05| You know, when Josh first brought this, he said, you know, Kim, this is exactly what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8165)|
| 2:16:10| you've been asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8170)|
| 2:16:12| And much of it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8172)|
| 2:16:15| And I am one to get in the weeds with detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8175)|
| 2:16:19| I mentioned to, you know, to the applicant and to staff, when we came up with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8179)|
| 2:16:24| ordinance, that we would need to tweak it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8184)|
| 2:16:27| You know, once we got through one application, it's a learning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8187)|
| 2:16:31| And don't worry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8191)|
| 2:16:32| We've been taking notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8192)|
| 2:16:33| And as I said before, this applicant, you know, it's kind of trial by fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8193)|
| 2:16:38| And they've done a really good job with responding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8198)|
| 2:16:44| But my question really is, is this body and is the applicant and is the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8204)|
| 2:16:53| community, you know, kind of pushing back on setting some of these expectations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8213)|
| 2:17:01| Because really, these are things that should already be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8221)|
| 2:17:06| And we're just asking you all to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8226)|
| 2:17:09| So my question, I have a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8229)|
| 2:17:11| Mr. Sanderson, are you comfortable with the considerations that I read out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8231)|
| 2:17:16| I mean, is there anything in there that you don't plan on doing already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8236)|
| 2:17:25| I don't really know what, I mean, other than being more, what other goal is it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8245)|
| 2:17:32| accomplishing than the 11 conditions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8252)|
| 2:17:36| More detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8256)|
| 2:17:39| More detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8259)|
| 2:17:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8261)|
| 2:17:42| I guess when will we find that out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8262)|
| 2:17:44| Or when will those be worked out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8264)|
| 2:17:45| When we come back and?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8265)|
| 2:17:47| It states it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8267)|
| 2:17:48| But it also, you know, my second question is, and while you're thinking about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8268)|
| 2:17:53| response, is to county staff, are you comfortable with the considerations that I stated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8273)|
| 2:18:03| Does that give you some clarity and some guidance on the expectations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8283)|
| 2:18:10| I think it does, Commissioner, especially in some of the things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8290)|
| 2:18:14| Josh mentioned this, like the signage and landscaping and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8294)|
| 2:18:18| The underlying zone, the ag zone, those landscaping centers are very different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8298)|
| 2:18:24| especially where it adjoins the residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8304)|
| 2:18:26| So it would help my department to have a little more clarity in some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8306)|
| 2:18:31| So I would say that, yes, in some instances that helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8311)|
| 2:18:35| And then to my colleagues, you're asking these questions and I've done the work for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8315)|
| 2:18:45| in these considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8325)|
| 2:18:47| Are there any of them that you aren't comfortable with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8327)|
| 2:18:54| So are we taking out the park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8334)|
| 2:18:56| Are we going to keep the park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8336)|
| 2:18:59| As I mentioned during work session, as it states right now, funding for the park is not in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8339)|
| 2:19:10| Parks and Recreational Budget and it hasn't been identified in their Master Park Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8350)|
| 2:19:17| Understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8357)|
| 2:19:18| We'll keep it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8358)|
| 2:19:19| Can we remove it from the conditions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8359)|
| 2:19:21| This is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8361)|
| 2:19:22| The traffic study goes down, too, when we take a public park out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8362)|
| 2:19:26| Do what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8366)|
| 2:19:27| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8367)|
| 2:19:28| The traffic study reduces drastically when we take out the fact that there won't be a public park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8368)|
| 2:19:32| And I'm not asking you to take it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8372)|
| 2:19:35| I'm just, it's put in here so that we have the option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8375)|
| 2:19:40| Well, it's not you all that have the option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8380)|
| 2:19:41| Tonight we're saying yes or no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8381)|
| 2:19:42| It's the option, the developer and you all's staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8382)|
| 2:19:45| We've got to follow you all's rules and regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8385)|
| 2:19:52| It's a heavy lift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8392)|
| 2:19:53| I just want to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8393)|
| 2:19:58| Taking on a park and recreational area, it's a heavy lift for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8398)|
| 2:20:02| No, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8402)|
| 2:20:03| Honestly, when we lay this out in Rocky Ridge, you're going to give 40 acres to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8403)|
| 2:20:07| and now Knox County is like, we don't want your 40 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8407)|
| 2:20:09| I've never tried to give something to somebody that's not unwanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8409)|
| 2:20:12| It's like you use the car analogy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8412)|
| 2:20:14| It's like me trying to literally give you the keys to the car and you're saying no, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8414)|
| 2:20:18| I don't know who's going to pay the insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8418)|
| 2:20:20| I don't know who's going to fill it up with gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8420)|
| 2:20:21| I don't know if I get no rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8421)|
| 2:20:22| What happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8422)|
| 2:20:23| All these unknowns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8423)|
| 2:20:24| There's so many unknowns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8424)|
| 2:20:25| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8425)|
| 2:20:27| If you all don't want a park, I sat down with Mayor Jacobs and Joe Mack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8427)|
| 2:20:32| Do you all want this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8432)|
| 2:20:33| Yeah, we will take this off and we do not want to put you in a hard spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8433)|
| 2:20:36| We want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8436)|
| 2:20:37| We'll figure it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8437)|
| 2:20:38| And we're not going to leave them hanging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8438)|
| 2:20:40| It's a $200 million investment for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8440)|
| 2:20:44| And you think you're worried about who's going to mow it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8444)|
| 2:20:47| We're worried that you all don't mow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8447)|
| 2:20:48| You're all worried that you all don't turn the lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8448)|
| 2:20:50| You all might chain it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8450)|
| 2:20:51| We're taking a lot more risks than you all are taking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8451)|
| 2:20:54| That's why I ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8454)|
| 2:20:55| If these are all the things that you're already going to do and it sounds like you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8455)|
| 2:20:59| Then the 11 conditions cover what we're expecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8459)|
| 2:21:04| I respectfully disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8464)|
| 2:21:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8468)|
| 2:21:11| Commissioner Ward, I saw your light first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8471)|
| 2:21:13| I believe Commissioner Daly was in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8473)|
| 2:21:15| But would it make things easier if I just adopted the edit that Commissioner Jay made to my motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8475)|
| 2:21:24| To make it just, this is not a substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8484)|
| 2:21:26| The original motion is what I made plus what Commissioner Jay added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8486)|
| 2:21:31| Because if Mr. Sanderson says he already did it, I trust him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8491)|
| 2:21:34| I think adding that in there isn't any much of an ask since he's already had it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8494)|
| 2:21:38| Are you fine with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8498)|
| 2:21:40| This way we don't have a substitute motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8500)|
| 2:21:44| I'm sorry, restate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8504)|
| 2:21:45| I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8505)|
| 2:21:46| I'm adopting your motion as my motion is what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8506)|
| 2:21:48| I'm the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8508)|
| 2:21:50| I'm saying I'll take your 12th and put it on that he has to do what you said for the cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8510)|
| 2:21:59| Yeah, if you want to add that as a 12th motion to your 12th condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8519)|
| 2:22:03| Yeah, my original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8523)|
| 2:22:05| And I'm leaving it vague on purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8525)|
| 2:22:08| Understand my intention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8528)|
| 2:22:10| Within 60 days, adequate fencing, maintenance mowing and access to the family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8530)|
| 2:22:15| And you guys know what's right and you guys know what's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8535)|
| 2:22:19| I know you're going to be building a whole bunch of stuff around it and it's going to seem like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8539)|
| 2:22:23| house from up in the middle of, it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8543)|
| 2:22:28| The goal is, the intention I have is to say let's honor the folks that are buried there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8548)|
| 2:22:34| I agree and I think the rest of the commissioners would agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8554)|
| 2:22:37| And I believe Josh when he says he's already had it done and that he'll make sure it's even nicer than before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8557)|
| 2:22:41| So I'm fine with that as long as my second's fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8561)|
| 2:22:44| That's the one they want to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8564)|
| 2:22:46| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8566)|
| 2:22:47| So I'll drop the substitute motion if you'll take that on as number 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8567)|
| 2:22:49| I'll take it on as 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8569)|
| 2:22:51| Does the second agree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8571)|
| 2:22:54| To withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8574)|
| 2:22:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8576)|
| 2:22:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8577)|
| 2:23:00| So we're back to the original motion now with the addition of taking care of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8580)|

| 2:23:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8601)|
| 2:23:22| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8602)|
| 2:23:23| I think you do have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8603)|
| 2:23:24| I'll second it unless everybody's cool with voting right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8604)|
| 2:23:27| Can we at least allow the district commissioner to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8607)|
| 2:23:30| Because she has not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8610)|
| 2:23:31| I was looking for her light and her light was not on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8611)|

| 2:23:41| Give me the floor back when you get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8621)|
| 2:23:44| Agreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8624)|
| 2:23:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8625)|
| 2:23:46| Thank you, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8626)|
| 2:23:48| This has really been difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8628)|
| 2:23:56| I will tell you, when I first saw the plan months and months ago, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8636)|
| 2:24:02| believe me, they've been working on this for well over a year, probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8642)|
| 2:24:08| closer to two years when the concept began.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8648)|
| 2:24:12| I was very excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8652)|
| 2:24:15| I thought this looked like something that would really be good for Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8655)|
| 2:24:19| County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8659)|
| 2:24:20| As I got further into it and talked to the community, it clearly became| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8660)|
| 2:24:26| clear to me, especially in the Emory Road area, all the neighbors and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8666)|
| 2:24:34| subdivisions that dealt with Emory Road every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8674)|
| 2:24:38| And remember, it's my community, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8678)|
| 2:24:41| I'm very familiar with the mess Emory Road is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8681)|
| 2:24:44| They were adamantly opposed, adamantly opposed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8684)|
| 2:24:50| And I have to listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8690)|
| 2:24:57| I have to listen to the people that elected me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8697)|
| 2:25:00| And I must say that my emails and my phone calls have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8700)|
| 2:25:05| overwhelmingly against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8705)|
| 2:25:09| I will say to this commission, though, the same thing I have said to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8709)|
| 2:25:15| every single person, every single email that I've gotten, every single| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8715)|
| 2:25:20| person I've talked to personally about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8720)|
| 2:25:25| This plan might not be perfect, but it is an effort to do what we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8725)|
| 2:25:34| been asking for in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8734)|
| 2:25:36| And that is something a little different, something a little creative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8736)|
| 2:25:40| And Smithville has made it very clear to me this isn't a threat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8740)|
| 2:25:45| It's just what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8745)|
| 2:25:47| They own this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8747)|
| 2:25:49| And this property will be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8749)|
| 2:25:53| And really, Commissioner Jay put it very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8753)|
| 2:25:58| The alternative is not good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8758)|
| 2:26:01| I mean, no one is happy about the row after row after row of subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8761)|
| 2:26:07| and development along Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8767)|
| 2:26:11| It wouldn't matter who the developer was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8771)|
| 2:26:13| The community is just not happy about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8773)|
| 2:26:16| But we have a chance here to do something different and creative to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8776)|
| 2:26:21| introduce some commercial retail space, to introduce, you know, some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8781)|
| 2:26:27| additional parks space, even if it's nothing more than Walking Trails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8787)|
| 2:26:32| and the Kayent Lodge, which my understanding from what Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8792)|
| 2:26:37| Vannervate has said, we have at least been promised that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8797)|
| 2:26:41| So is it perfect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8801)|
| 2:26:43| No, it is not at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8803)|
| 2:26:45| However, I have told my constituents you might be sorry what you get if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8805)|
| 2:26:55| you don't take what's being offered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8815)|
| 2:26:58| However, I have committed to them that I cannot support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8818)|
| 2:27:04| I will tell you personally, I'm not sure that's a wise vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8824)|
| 2:27:09| but they didn't elect me to express my opinion up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8829)|
| 2:27:15| They elected me to represent them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8835)|
| 2:27:17| So I cannot support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8837)|
| 2:27:20| However, I do so with great reservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8840)|
| 2:27:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-zoning?start=8845)|
