| 0:00:49| January's been like 700 days. So our January 19th policy review meeting was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=49)|
| 0:00:55| canceled due to the weather last week. So that meeting's been rescheduled to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=55)|

| 0:01:17| noon, so board members please just make efforts to attend that luncheon. And with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=77)|
| 0:01:23| that, are there any changes to this agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=83)|
| 0:01:28| A motion by Ms. Horne, a second by Ms. Christie. All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=88)|
| 0:01:34| Okay, motion passes. Dr. Ryslick, I'll hand it to you for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=94)|
| 0:01:39| superintendent's report. I'm sure you have lots of, lots of things to report on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=99)|
| 0:01:42| Thank you, Ms. Henderson. I do appreciate it and I do, I'm really trying not to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=102)|
| 0:01:48| these longer, but things keep popping up. So we'll do that. So thank you very much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=108)|
| 0:01:54| Ms. Henderson, members of the board. So I want to start actually, obviously changing from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=114)|
| 0:01:58| events of what took place today and kind of give an update again to the board. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=118)|
| 0:02:02| know I was able to text and either myself or members of our staff to kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=122)|
| 0:02:07| of keep you abreast of where, of where things were today. I'll start for again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=127)|
| 0:02:12| in my comments. I'll be honest, it's just as a person, it was scary today, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=132)|
| 0:02:17| And I think we've all had that moment to be a little emotional about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=137)|
| 0:02:21| things and was fortunate to be able to speak to the staff at Halls Middle with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=141)|
| 0:02:26| Ms. Strickland today and, you know, to look those folks in the eye and know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=146)|
| 0:02:30| everything we thought was real today and they thought it was real too and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=150)|
| 0:02:34| handled it like it was real. And they did a great job, you know, they're heroes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=154)|
| 0:02:39| And to the Halls community and to those, to those children, thank God it wasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=159)|
| 0:02:47| real today, but none of us knew that initially. And so I just appreciate again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=167)|
| 0:02:52| what our teachers did today. Ms. Strickland's leadership, she was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=172)|
| 0:02:56| phenomenal through the whole thing. Even the support from the Halls team. Mr. Long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=176)|
| 0:03:00| was down. I started my morning with Mr. Lynn at Halls Elementary this morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=180)|
| 0:03:05| and just their willingness to kind of pull together to quickly allow us to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=185)|
| 0:03:10| able to move was great. So with that, I will share the facts too, but I wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=190)|
| 0:03:14| say that on the front side of things that we appreciate that. So for those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=194)|
| 0:03:18| who don't know, I know the board does, but for the public who doesn't know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=198)|
| 0:03:21| earlier today we were, there was a call placed at the 9-1-1 regarding a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=201)|
| 0:03:25| potential threat to Halls Middle School. All of our students are safe. All of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=205)|
| 0:03:29| staff are safe as well. Our security and law enforcement partners and our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=209)|
| 0:03:36| security team cleared the building. I'm happy to report this. This is, it was, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=216)|
| 0:03:41| was really great to see Chief and his team. I've talked with Tom Spangler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=221)|
| 0:03:45| today. He's out of town, but I had some conversations with him about things as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=225)|
| 0:03:48| well. You know, all the work we put in, all the talk we do about safety, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=228)|
| 0:03:54| that's come up time and time again this week. We started the school year talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=234)|
| 0:03:57| about safety. You know, those press conferences we hold are not for show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=237)|
| 0:04:00| Those press conferences are to talk about what we do and what we think our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=240)|
| 0:04:03| number one thing is, and that is to keep kids safe and to keep our staff safe. You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=243)|
| 0:04:08| know, the fact that we have the relationships where I can talk to Tom, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=248)|
| 0:04:11| could talk to Chief Perriard. We have that. Chief Noel, Chief Perriard has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=251)|
| 0:04:15| those same relationships with the FBI, with Homeland Security, with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=255)|
| 0:04:19| Secret Service, all those. Like, I've met with those guys too. With him, we know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=259)|
| 0:04:24| that. Our security team today, and I know some of those folks are in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=264)|
| 0:04:28| room, responded today the way they should, and the way as a dad, I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=268)|
| 0:04:36| want him to respond, not just as a superintendent. When we got there, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=276)|
| 0:04:40| were fully in charge. They had our officers were on the ground. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=280)|
| 0:04:45| security, the sheriff's team were on the ground. They're doing exactly what they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=285)|
| 0:04:48| should do. Families were safe and being informed. I'm happy to report 46 minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=288)|
| 0:04:54| from the time the call came in to all clear at the building. That doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=294)|
| 0:04:57| happen without coordination, and that doesn't happen without planning on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=297)|
| 0:05:01| front side and all the drills that we go through and the practices. Chief pointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=301)|
| 0:05:05| out, it's very true, we did two of these simulations, and it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=305)|
| 0:05:09| hard going through the simulations. I won't name the schools. The FBI came and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=309)|
| 0:05:13| did them, and they picked schools and took pictures of our hallways this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=313)|
| 0:05:15| summer, and we walked through it with everybody, including Charm Allen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=315)|
| 0:05:19| What would happen now if we did all of those kinds of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=319)|
| 0:05:22| things, and we do all of that for events like today. And again, Miss Strickland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=322)|
| 0:05:28| talking about, we practice these drills. They did, and their people followed those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=328)|
| 0:05:32| today, and every kid, they talked about pulling kids out of hallways and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=332)|
| 0:05:34| getting them in, getting them from the cafeteria to places where they were with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=334)|
| 0:05:37| an adult and protected, and it happened like that, and they did it. So they did a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=337)|
| 0:05:43| great job with that, and you know, made us feel good. You never feel good in days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=343)|
| 0:05:47| like this, but you feel good to know that the preparation has been put in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=347)|
| 0:05:50| and that we would have, had it been real, hopefully been able to avoid a whole lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=350)|
| 0:05:54| of things today that could have happened. Again, can't say enough about Miss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=354)|
| 0:05:58| Strickland and her team, and what they did, the teachers in the building, our law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=358)|
| 0:06:02| enforcement partners, and everything that they did as well, and you know, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=362)|
| 0:06:07| think hopefully, it was kind of nice to, as we talked to the staff, thank them for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=367)|
| 0:06:12| what they had done, and obviously we let them and the kids go. Parents need to hug| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=372)|
| 0:06:15| their children today, and they didn't need to wait till 3.30 to do that, and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=375)|
| 0:06:19| we appreciated, you know, Miss Strickland's thought on that, and allowed that to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=379)|
| 0:06:22| happen as well, but just appreciative of the community. Talking to some of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=382)|
| 0:06:27| officers on the end, you know, they said, we sent extra support for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=387)|
| 0:06:31| checkout, all those kinds of things, but Ryan did a great job with getting buses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=391)|
| 0:06:35| there, so we could move kids as fast as we could, but they were saying, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=395)|
| 0:06:38| families leaving the halls community, as they were leaving the door, that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=398)|
| 0:06:41| were getting ten times thank you's to any complaints, and I think that speaks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=401)|
| 0:06:45| a lot to the work that our people did today. So hopefully, we don't have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=405)|
| 0:06:50| experience that again, but I also hope that it does help parents understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=410)|
| 0:06:56| that we take it serious, and that we're ready, and you know, some of the folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=416)|
| 0:07:00| are in the back of the room who do this too, and thank you for what you guys do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=420)|
| 0:07:03| Again, some of you were there today, and our response was great, and appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=423)|
| 0:07:07| Chief and his leadership, and just all the program that we have, and I'll say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=427)|
| 0:07:10| this, Chief even said this in our press conference today, and he's right, thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=430)|
| 0:07:13| you all. You all have chosen to invest in the security team, and today, when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=433)|
| 0:07:17| thought we needed it, it showed up, and your Chief said, we weren't built like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=437)|
| 0:07:21| this two years ago. That's investments you guys have made in the budget to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=441)|
| 0:07:24| that happen, and to keep our kids and our staff safe, so thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=444)|
| 0:07:30| All right, on a lighter note, how about that? All right, thank you for the chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=450)|
| 0:07:36| to share some additional updates. I'd like to begin by pointing out that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=456)|
| 0:07:41| received some feedback from students who were disappointed that we didn't get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=461)|
| 0:07:44| enough snow days last year, so it's clearly important that you, we took| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=464)|
| 0:07:49| care of what you wanted this year, so we're always trying to take care of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=469)|
| 0:07:52| students. Seriously, I do know that many of the Knoxvillians, I know that many of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=472)|
| 0:07:56| us Knoxvillians, the blizzard of 1993 is one of those iconic moments that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=476)|
| 0:08:00| remember. I know I remember that too, and this snowstorm and its lingering effects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=480)|
| 0:08:04| will be another one that we look back at. Hopefully we don't have another one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=484)|
| 0:08:07| these next year, so hopefully we look and see that, so I do hope that our students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=487)|
| 0:08:12| families, and staff were able to enjoy the unexpected time, to spend time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=492)|
| 0:08:15| together, to play in the snow, and make memories. I mean, that was, I think during| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=495)|
| 0:08:18| one of the media things, we were asked that question, you know, as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=498)|
| 0:08:21| superintendent, what do you think? I'm like, you know what, doggone it, go enjoy the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=501)|
| 0:08:24| snow, you know, make some memories with your kids. We don't get this kind of snow all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=504)|
| 0:08:27| the time. Our teachers are more than qualified to get us where we need to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=507)|
| 0:08:31| We, our calendar committee's planned in advance. We put more days in the spring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=511)|
| 0:08:34| typically. Dr. Wilson does a great job leading that and making sure we do for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=514)|
| 0:08:37| illness and for weather days and that sort of thing, so I think people did do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=517)|
| 0:08:42| that. So, I specifically want to say thank you to the KCS Knox County School and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=522)|
| 0:08:47| City of Knoxville employees who have begun working days, nights, and weekends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=527)|
| 0:08:50| to prepare our roads and schools for return. I know we were able to do a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=530)|
| 0:08:53| press conference to show some of that work. I think our family message that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=533)|

| 0:17:25| thought too it was good just to kind of orient back into like where do these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1045)|
| 0:17:29| days come from, we always get questions I think to Dr. Roswick's point, when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1049)|
| 0:17:33| have snow days that we don't use, about why we don't take those back away, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1053)|
| 0:17:36| those sorts of questions, and so just again trying to ease sort of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1056)|
| 0:17:41| understanding of kind of how we got to where we are, and then kind of how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1061)|
| 0:17:44| we're going to respond in that situation, so obviously it's been a long time since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1064)|
| 0:17:49| we've been in a scenario where the inclement weather days that we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1069)|
| 0:17:51| planned, we've actually exhausted all of them over the course of the year, very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1071)|
| 0:17:55| rare that we would do this before the end of January, and so we do want to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1075)|
| 0:17:59| responsive to that, that we are in a unique situation I think in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1079)|
| 0:18:02| what we've experienced over the past several years, so I'll draw your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1082)|
| 0:18:06| attention to this idea of stockpile days, state law it indicates a lot about what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1086)|
| 0:18:12| our school schedule looks like, how many school days we attend, what those school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1092)|
| 0:18:15| days are made up of, and several of those details in that, and one of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1095)|
| 0:18:19| details is that we're required by the state to go to school every day for six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1099)|
| 0:18:22| and a half hours, Knox County schools, and this is what's allowable by the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1102)|
| 0:18:26| and so we take advantage of that, you are allowed to go for a longer period of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1106)|
| 0:18:29| time each day, and in doing that you can bank that time to earn stockpile days to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1109)|
| 0:18:34| give you some different options around ways to build extra things into your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1114)|
| 0:18:38| schedule, so when you look at our schedule again adding that 30 minutes a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1118)|
| 0:18:42| day, over the course of a year we earn that maximum number that the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1122)|
| 0:18:46| allows, which is 13 stockpile days, what we choose to do with those, again defined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1126)|
| 0:18:50| in law as to what we can do, what we choose right now to do is to use eight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1130)|
| 0:18:54| of those in planning and in preparation for inclement weather, and then we use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1134)|
| 0:18:58| five for professional learning, and so that's broken down by our three regular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1138)|
| 0:19:02| in-service days that have always happened in the course of the year, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1142)|
| 0:19:06| happen once students are back in school, and we pull out and shut down for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1146)|
| 0:19:09| day and have in-service those three days that we have, and then a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1149)|
| 0:19:12| years ago we decided to try out this this idea of early release, to build some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1152)|
| 0:19:17| professional development time back into the afternoon, send kids home a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1157)|
| 0:19:21| earlier in the afternoon, give kids or teachers some extended planning time, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1161)|
| 0:19:25| we do that six days throughout the year, which actually each time we do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1165)|
| 0:19:29| counts as a third of a day, if you will, so in total six days, a third of a day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1169)|
| 0:19:34| for each one of those is two total professional development days that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1174)|
| 0:19:38| have through that, and so those 13 days in combination the eight inclement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1178)|
| 0:19:42| weather and the five professional development total are 13 stockpile days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1182)|
| 0:19:46| Now that, as Dr. Rice has already pointed out, we have used all of the eight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1186)|
| 0:19:51| inclement weather days that we have, we do want to acknowledge that and be as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1191)|
| 0:19:56| prepared as possible as we can, should we have some additional weather, again we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1196)|
| 0:20:00| are still fairly early in the winter and we know we can have unexpected happen at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1200)|
| 0:20:04| any time. Additionally, in looking at our opportunities to buy back some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1204)|
| 0:20:09| we've also missed some school, right, and so we were looking at our earliest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1209)|
| 0:20:12| opportunities to to bank back some instructional time, to give teachers more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1212)|
| 0:20:16| time with students, and to do that, and so our plan to move forward, at least in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1216)|
| 0:20:21| this moment, and as Dr. Rice mentioned, will most likely require board action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1221)|
| 0:20:25| since these are things that are part of the calendar, our plan to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1225)|
| 0:20:28| would be to convert the remaining early release days, we were set to have one in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1228)|
| 0:20:32| January, February, and March, we would convert those third of a day's back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1232)|
| 0:20:37| to get one day back, and so those would become full instructional days, kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1237)|
| 0:20:40| would not be dismissed early, and then we have one remaining February in-service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1240)|
| 0:20:44| day, that would have been a day students would not have reported, we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1244)|
| 0:20:48| convert that to an instructional day as well. So what that will do is, if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1248)|
| 0:20:51| think again, like think of it like a bank, that puts two more days back in the bank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1251)|
| 0:20:54| for us, that if we have snow, if we have wind, if we have something that we feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1254)|
| 0:20:59| like safety has been compromised and we can't send kids to school, we've got two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1259)|
| 0:21:03| days to work with in that, and we buy back additional instructional time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1263)|
| 0:21:06| really at a time of year that it'll be more valuable to us than to try to think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1266)|
| 0:21:10| about extending the school year or doing anything like that. That, we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1270)|
| 0:21:14| bring the plan, as John mentioned, sorry Dr. Rousey mentioned, to the board around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1274)|
| 0:21:19| these two days, if we found ourselves in a position where we had to, you know, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1279)|
| 0:21:25| had three more snow days that we had to have, we obviously would have to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1285)|
| 0:21:28| additional plans, but we feel like at this time, we want to prepare again, build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1288)|
| 0:21:33| back the instructional time, and then if we find ourselves in a position where we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1293)|
| 0:21:36| need to think about changes to the school year or additional days, we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1296)|

| 0:21:47| not having to use that at this point. So I'll pause there for any questions that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1307)|
| 0:21:52| you guys have, or Dr. Rousey, if you're going to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1312)|
| 0:21:58| No, you're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1318)|

| 0:22:04| I'm sure it was going to be a little bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1324)|
| 0:22:06| That was great. Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| Thank you, Madam Chair. So, just to ask the question, because I'm still trying to do the math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1328)|
| 0:22:14| Sure. January 24th was a snow day, so really we have one day and two-thirds, or does that two-thirds count as a day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1334)|
| 0:22:23| So, because we weren't in school and because we didn't take that third of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1343)|
| 0:22:27| day, we technically can still count it as part of the formula. At least that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1347)|
| 0:22:31| what we are counting on, as we will most likely have to notify the state that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1351)|
| 0:22:35| this is what we're doing, but we should still be able to count that in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1355)|
| 0:22:38| I talked actually with Guy Rasmus, who's our information technology person, who kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1358)|
| 0:22:43| handles changes with our calendar to the state, and they kind of treat those days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1363)|
| 0:22:46| a little bit weird in terms of their formula, as he was telling me, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1366)|
| 0:22:50| once again, like when we have a half day in the school year, we're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1370)|
| 0:22:53| given a half day of credit for that. We're actually given the whole day's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1373)|
| 0:22:55| worth of credit. They treat these kind of changes within the instructional year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1375)|
| 0:22:58| a little bit different, but his stance was we would be able to count that as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1378)|
| 0:23:02| a whole day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1382)|
| 0:23:06| Okay. I appreciate this from Dr. Wilson and them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1386)|
| 0:23:11| working on trying to get through this, because it is tricky. I think what you'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1391)|
| 0:23:15| see on this is the proposal we're bringing tries to still help families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1395)|
| 0:23:19| and we know a lot of people plan spring break, a lot of people plan things early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1399)|
| 0:23:23| in the school year as well, so our hope is, you know, historically, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1403)|
| 0:23:28| don't think we've used over three days in like the last eight years or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| something. Like, it's been a long time, so if we recoup these two days, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1410)|
| 0:23:34| would not cause us to go into spring break or end of year, to Dr. Wilson's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1414)|
| 0:23:37| point, unless we got, you know, another blizzard or something, we'd probably have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1417)|
| 0:23:40| to, but I think this at least allows families to keep their plans as they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1420)|
| 0:23:44| and still buys us back a few days, so I appreciate the thinking in that. Can I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1424)|

| 0:25:50| through the budget process. Like Dr. Reiswick said, today is an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1550)|
| 0:25:55| for us to give you a more detailed look at the budget process itself. We know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1555)|
| 0:26:00| that this process ultimately culminates in us presenting a proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1560)|
| 0:26:06| budget to you all that we are then going to, that you all will then have to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1566)|
| 0:26:11| a decision on. So this is, the purpose of this is to familiarize you with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1571)|
| 0:26:16| process that we have started and will continue throughout this semester. What| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1576)|
| 0:26:20| we won't have today is the budget proposal itself. That will come a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1580)|
| 0:26:26| little later in the semester. So today is about the process. Why are we here to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1586)|
| 0:26:33| tell you about the process? Because we are accountable for six hundred and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1593)|
| 0:26:38| sixty million of the taxpayers dollars. So we want to be transparent in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| approach to the process, transparent in the outcomes that our budget produces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1602)|
| 0:26:46| and transparent in how we associated dollars to produce those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1606)|
| 0:26:51| outcomes. Our budget is a very people-focused budget. As you all, most of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1611)|
| 0:26:56| you all know, 80% of our budget is people, is personnel. 80% of the six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1616)|
| 0:27:02| hundred and sixty million dollars. So this is our opportunity to convey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1622)|
| 0:27:07| to you all and to convey to the public at how we arrive at the budget that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1627)|
| 0:27:14| presented to you all later this semester. We have a new approach to budget. Not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1634)|
| 0:27:21| necessarily new in intent. We have a student focused stewardship. We're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1641)|
| 0:27:26| entrusted, like we said, with six hundred and sixty million of taxpayers dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| to improve outcomes for all students. We have a, our intent is to to produce those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1649)|
| 0:27:36| outcomes, and we are now structured in a way to execute better on on that intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1656)|
| 0:27:41| The budget process is requiring priority alignment for each line item in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1661)|
| 0:27:47| budget, as well as alignment to producing student outcomes. The way that we are, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1667)|
| 0:27:53| new way that we are approaching the budget is intended to allow us to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1673)|
| 0:27:58| able to evaluate whether or not those intended outcomes came, or whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1678)|
| 0:28:04| or not we need to revisit those line items in future years to redirect those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1684)|
| 0:28:08| funds to something that has a greater impact on student outcomes. So our budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1688)|
| 0:28:14| budget process, revenues, needs, and proposal. Revenues and needs could could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1694)|
| 0:28:20| technically be at the same time. This isn't necessarily in order. Our budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1700)|
| 0:28:24| team monitors and projects revenues throughout the course of the year, but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1704)|
| 0:28:29| we receive those revenue numbers next month, a little later in the second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1709)|

| 0:28:52| the the opportunities that our community has to provide input. We'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1732)|
| 0:28:59| talk through those in a little bit, but we have electronic opportunities, we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1739)|
| 0:29:03| in-person opportunities, several several different spots where we will collect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1743)|
| 0:29:08| information from our our stakeholders, which ultimately culminates, like we said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1748)|
| 0:29:13| in a proposal to you all to a budget for the following year that that you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1753)|

| 0:29:51| is fall 2023 we did release the community engagement surveys, received a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1791)|
| 0:29:57| little over 2,000 responses on those, and that's if you'll notice that was a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1797)|
| 0:30:03| little earlier than we traditionally do those budget surveys. Typically those are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1803)|

| 0:31:01| Okay, so to give you a brief overview of what I'm going to be covering here for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1861)|
| 0:31:06| the next few slides, we're going to talk about revenues like Ms. Himmelgarn said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1866)|
| 0:31:10| and then we're going to do a little bit of a deeper dive on to TISA because it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1870)|
| 0:31:14| is fairly new to the district this year in the state. We're going to tie it back in to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1874)|
| 0:31:19| the last conversations we had with the board I guess last March and April when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1879)|
| 0:31:24| we were building the current year budget. We talked about TISA then and at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1884)|
| 0:31:27| board workshop in September or retreat in September we talked about TISA and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1887)|
| 0:31:34| compared it a little bit to BEP. So we'll finish up with that. Before we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1894)|
| 0:31:39| into the revenue discussion, I do want to clarify this because there's, if we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1899)|
| 0:31:43| not careful when we talk about this piece, we always or sometimes confuse the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1903)|
| 0:31:47| public on this. The revenues we're going to take a closer look at this afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1907)|
| 0:31:52| is going to be our general purpose revenues and so what that excludes and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1912)|
| 0:31:56| what we're not going to be talking about here are those things that are federal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1916)|
| 0:31:59| grants. So if you if you look at that you're talking about IDEA, special ed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1919)|
| 0:32:05| grants, tied or consolidated money, also our child or school nutrition program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1925)|
| 0:32:11| and then our capital budget which is not federal money but is funded through a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1931)|
| 0:32:15| different mechanism. What we'll be talking about is on this chart. It's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1935)|
| 0:32:20| little bit busy but it does do what I said earlier, it ties back to what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1940)|
| 0:32:23| we last discussed with the board on revenue and it does tie also to what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1943)|
| 0:32:28| talked with the board at the workshop or at the retreat concerning ESSER and kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1948)|
| 0:32:33| of what impact that may have on the upcoming budget. So if you think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1953)|
| 0:32:40| general purpose revenues, what comprises that category? And you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1960)|
| 0:32:45| for the most part know it's really two big categories, state revenues and local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1965)|
| 0:32:50| revenues. State is about 48 percent of that equation this year and that's sent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1970)|
| 0:32:56| to the district through TISA and then local revenues is state or local taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1976)|
| 0:33:02| which would be sales tax and property taxes. That's 50 percent of our current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1982)|
| 0:33:07| revenue source. 34 percent of that 50 percent is our local option sales taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1987)|
| 0:33:12| and property taxes makes up the other 16 percent. You won't see property taxes on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1992)|
| 0:33:17| this graph because it's already a busy graph but also because by the very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=1997)|
| 0:33:22| nature of property taxes it's typically a flat revenue so it would just be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2002)|
| 0:33:26| another line added across the bottom that's not very dynamic. So what I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2006)|
| 0:33:31| to look at and focus in on here is at the bottom you see 22-23 so that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2011)|
| 0:33:36| last fiscal year. 23-24 is our current fiscal year and we talked about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2016)|
| 0:33:40| back in March. We've really over the last two to three years have seen anomalies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2020)|
| 0:33:45| in our funding in the general purpose budget and that was due to the COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2025)|
| 0:33:49| year in fiscal year 21. So you go back to that year we really underestimated and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2029)|
| 0:33:55| very conservative on how much sales tax we thought the district would receive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2035)|

| 0:34:04| what happened of course after the fact was sales tax revenues were really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2044)|
| 0:34:09| strong even through COVID. We saw a shift in where that money came from during| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| COVID but it was really good and so you combine the fact that we underestimated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2052)|
| 0:34:17| how much we thought we were going to get and then it even grew on top of that so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2057)|
| 0:34:20| fiscal year 22 and 23 we were able to realize probably the largest year-over-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2060)|
| 0:34:26| year sales tax growth we've seen in a long time here. So if you look at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2066)|
| 0:34:30| 22-23 number there the bottom piece of that the BEP number and that was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2070)|
| 0:34:34| last year the state used BEP as their funding model it was three and a half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2074)|
| 0:34:40| percent growth. That's about normal what we've been seeing over the last few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2080)|
| 0:34:45| years if you take the COVID years out of this out this picture and then jump| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2085)|
| 0:34:50| forward to this current year this is when we talked with the board back in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2090)|
| 0:34:53| March we said you know really sales tax is going to normalize so you see that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2093)|
| 0:34:56| sales sales tax number dropped down to about 3.9 percent that's three to four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2096)|
| 0:35:02| percent is typically normal sales tax growth but TISA or the state funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2102)|
| 0:35:07| increased by 26 percent so really that increased a pretty significant amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2107)|
| 0:35:13| how much money we received this year. So if you look at the last two years just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2113)|
| 0:35:17| to put this into coming to a dollar's figure we received 50 million new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2117)|
| 0:35:22| dollars in 23 69 million in the current year and we told you back in April those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2122)|
| 0:35:29| those numbers don't happen typically those those those are the largest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2129)|
| 0:35:33| year-to-year increases I've seen in revenue since I've been with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| district and we told you at the time that this is going to this will be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2135)|
| 0:35:39| problem for us come next year because our revenues are going to normalize and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2139)|
| 0:35:44| you add to that that top line the ESSER line up there if you look at the items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2144)|
| 0:35:49| that we funded out of ESSER and if you look at the total ESSER amount is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2149)|
| 0:35:53| hundred and fourteen million dollars and I just listed the four things here that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2153)|
| 0:35:58| were really position related or personnel related and Academy coaches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2158)|
| 0:36:03| college and career coaches tutors and permanent subs and we talked about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2163)|
| 0:36:07| at the retreat back in September about you know if you look at all of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2167)|
| 0:36:10| it's about fifteen and a half million dollars so the district and the board's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2170)|
| 0:36:13| going to work through which which of those do principals and teachers deem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2173)|
| 0:36:17| the most necessary and are we getting the best ROI on and how do we include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2177)|
| 0:36:22| those in next year and future budgets looking forward a little bit to fiscal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2182)|

| 0:36:35| the numbers like dr. Isaac was saying here but nine million dollars is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2195)|
| 0:36:39| little bit lower than what we traditionally see when you when you take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2199)|
| 0:36:42| out the COVID years sales tax is fairly normal but the one at the bottom that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2202)|
| 0:36:47| a little bit concerning there is the TISA increase it's only at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2207)|
| 0:36:51| about a half of a percent increase is what we've been told to expect that's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2211)|
| 0:36:55| little bit lower than what we were told last year a percent to a percent and a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2215)|
| 0:36:59| half and I think that decrease is probably just due to the to the slower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2219)|
| 0:37:03| slower growth and not only state collected taxes but also local sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2223)|
| 0:37:08| taxes last thing on this slide over to the right the additional considerations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2228)|
| 0:37:13| these are other items one is a potential thing that could help in terms of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2233)|
| 0:37:19| revenue reduction we just saw the other ones are considerations of expenditures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2239)|
| 0:37:23| that we're going to have to find a way to also included future budgets if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2243)|
| 0:37:28| recall last year when we met with you all about the budget we talked about how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2248)|
| 0:37:31| do we take some of that 69 million new dollars last year and not how do we set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2251)|
| 0:37:36| aside some of that for future years and so the board and superintendent were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2256)|
| 0:37:40| smart to not put all that into recurring costs so I'm assuming orange said that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2260)|
| 0:37:45| 80% of our current year budget is personnel if you go back to last year is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2265)|
| 0:37:49| 83% so we purposely reduce that in order to build in some realized savings for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2269)|
| 0:37:55| this coming year so that will help the fact that our revenues being reduced a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2275)|
| 0:37:59| bit we'll have a significant amount of realized savings to put back into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2279)|
| 0:38:04| budget the second item there is governor Lee's initiative to ensure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2284)|
| 0:38:09| the starting teacher salary is $50,000 by fiscal year 27 so that would be by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2289)|
| 0:38:15| July of 2026 we've told the board this several times I think but if our is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2295)|
| 0:38:22| as our salary schedule currently stands and that may change based on the salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2302)|
| 0:38:26| schedule study that's about a 45 million dollar injection needed into salaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2306)|
| 0:38:32| over the next three years pretty significant initiative the salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2312)|
| 0:38:37| schedule study is also going to come with a price tag just based on what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2317)|
| 0:38:40| board decides to adopt from that unbudgeted items we always talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2320)|
| 0:38:44| those with the board when we meet with you guys in April March and April those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2324)|
| 0:38:48| are items that tries as hard as we may to predict what's going to happen in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2328)|
| 0:38:53| fall you can never get that right you're going to have students that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2333)|
| 0:38:56| different needs and that's going to come along with some unbudgeted positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2336)|
| 0:39:01| and unbudgeted services as well and then other fixed increases at the bottom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2341)|
| 0:39:05| those would be things like health insurance we have no control over that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2345)|
| 0:39:10| increase workers comp insurance software prices that go up contracted services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2350)|
| 0:39:17| that we use those things are all increasing just due to inflation most of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2357)|
| 0:39:21| the time and so that those are also going to impact our coming budget take a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2361)|
| 0:39:30| little bit of a deeper dive into TISA here I do want to mention at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2370)|
| 0:39:35| if you go back to last year we were talking about the state injected a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2375)|
| 0:39:39| billion dollars into education and that's significant the most significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2379)|
| 0:39:44| change in the state's education model in 30 years I think 1993 is when the BEP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2384)|
| 0:39:50| was was rolled out so it's very significant change and it is recurring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2390)|
| 0:39:54| revenue and that creates a little bit of misnomer I think for the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2394)|
| 0:40:01| sometimes that one time billion dollar injection was significant and it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2401)|
| 0:40:05| recurring but it doesn't mean that that amount is going to be injected in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2405)|
| 0:40:10| outgoing years every year you know we had a 26% increase and then it's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2410)|
| 0:40:15| to be one to one and a half or even a half a percent like we saw going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2415)|
| 0:40:19| so that's that's a challenge for the district to consider and how do we how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2419)|
| 0:40:23| do we make sure that we we are investing and and also in lieu of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2423)|
| 0:40:28| potentially revenue increases that aren't keeping up with inflationary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2428)|
| 0:40:32| increases we'll talk a couple of minutes here about what what's what's similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2432)|
| 0:40:39| between the BEP and TISA and then what what is some differences and so this the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2439)|
| 0:40:44| first look we'll have here is what are the differences we talked about this at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2444)|
| 0:40:48| the workshop or retreat in September basic education program was a resource| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2448)|
| 0:40:54| based model and so by that we mean the state would look at Knox County schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2454)|
| 0:40:59| and say this is just an example of a group they would take how many k3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2459)|
| 0:41:04| students as Knox County school schools have and then they would say okay based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2464)|
| 0:41:09| on the ratio that we used to say the classroom size should be of 20 to 1 what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2469)|
| 0:41:14| how many teachers does that give Knox County schools and then based on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2474)|
| 0:41:18| state's salary figure they're using they would multiply that out and say here's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2478)|
| 0:41:23| dollar amount and then they would add to that in this case take away from that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2483)|
| 0:41:27| the fiscal capacity of Knox County to fund this locally so we'd end up getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2487)|
| 0:41:31| about 63 percent of whatever that dollar value was and they would send the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2491)|
| 0:41:35| to us and then we would decide how to allocate it here TISA changed that and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2495)|
| 0:41:40| turn it upside down they now the state is still looking at the group of k3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2500)|
| 0:41:45| students as a whole and saying it's this many teachers and as many dollars it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2505)|
| 0:41:48| okay let's take this this kindergarten student what are the characteristics of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2508)|
| 0:41:52| this student are they a special ed student are they an ELL student do they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2512)|
| 0:41:58| have dyslexia are they an economically disadvantaged school all of those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2518)|
| 0:42:03| impact the funding of that one child across the district and so that's how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2523)|
| 0:42:08| they are now sending money to the district so it's that's why it's called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2528)|
| 0:42:12| student based instead of resource based which would be a teacher principal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2532)|
| 0:42:16| assistant principal and that type of thing those are the main differences and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2536)|
| 0:42:20| they're pretty significant differences and we'll talk more about that in just a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2540)|
| 0:42:22| second the similarity is in both of these are funding plans so the state has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2542)|
| 0:42:28| not told districts you have to spend the money differently because we're changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2548)|
| 0:42:32| how we're sending it to you we still have the flexibility as a district to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2552)|
| 0:42:37| say these are our initiatives and these are tied to these priorities and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2557)|
| 0:42:41| how we want to spend the money so that's that's the similarity there hey Joe I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2561)|
| 0:42:45| hate to break in real fast I had a message from the audience and some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2565)|
| 0:42:49| the audience are having a hard time hearing so I don't know if maybe there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2569)|
| 0:42:52| a way I know the microphones on so if everyone can maybe just maybe get a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2572)|
| 0:42:56| little closer to the microphone yeah sorry maybe that'd be helpful let me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2576)|
| 0:43:00| start over okay so this slide is a graphical representation the first two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2580)|
| 0:43:11| blocks are BEP just to kind of walk you through what I just talked about it has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2591)|
| 0:43:17| three different students and it shows you that regardless of what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2597)|

| 0:43:35| students at individual schools and so you can see that number of student A, B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2615)|
| 0:43:39| and C doesn't change even though those three students are different looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2619)|

| 0:43:57| if you look down at student B they also have some additional weighted funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2637)|
| 0:44:02| added into it and the weighted funding in this case is the student is an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2642)|

| 0:44:10| who is directly certified for free and reduced lunch and that student would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2650)|
| 0:44:14| generate a 25% increase on top of the base amount for the district and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2654)|
| 0:44:19| student C is not only economically disadvantaged but also has an additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2659)|
| 0:44:24| unique learning need and so those unique learning needs can increase the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2664)|
| 0:44:28| funding from that child from anywhere from 15% to 150% and so you can see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2668)|
| 0:44:33| pretty pretty big variance between student A and student C in that middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2673)|
| 0:44:38| column and then like I said earlier that it's still reduced by the fiscal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2678)|
| 0:44:42| capacity index so what that means is when the state creates these funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2682)|
| 0:44:47| models they say districts 70% of this funding is on the state and 30% is on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2687)|
| 0:44:53| the district meaning those local option taxes we talked about property taxes but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2693)|
| 0:44:58| then they also look at they take two markers and that generate a capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2698)|
| 0:45:03| index based on the district and the area of the state you live in and so and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2703)|
| 0:45:10| adjust that either up or down so if you're in an area that's very rural then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2710)|
| 0:45:14| you may get more than 70% from the state in Knox County's case we actually get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2714)|
| 0:45:20| less than 70% so for this current year we received 62% of the dollars you see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2720)|

| 0:45:37| the last box what did what this looks at is if if Knox County ever decided to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2737)|
| 0:45:45| change how we do allocate to schools this is potentially what it would look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2745)|
| 0:45:50| like and I mentioned this because if you look at some states that have gone to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2750)|
| 0:45:55| state changing how they allocate dollars to districts differently which is what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2755)|
| 0:45:59| we're doing now instead of a resource base we're under a student based model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2759)|
| 0:46:03| districts in some cases also look at that and think maybe that model works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2763)|
| 0:46:08| best for us here as well so what that means is right now we're going through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2768)|
| 0:46:12| our staffing committee process staffing allocations for next year are being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2772)|
| 0:46:15| developed and and what that traditionally has looked like is based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2775)|
| 0:46:20| on the demographics at those schools the number of students were projected to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2780)|
| 0:46:25| have at those schools the district has traditionally said based on these ratios| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2785)|
| 0:46:29| school a you get 20 teachers next year and that's how that's a resource based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2789)|
| 0:46:34| allocation model some districts are moving away from that instead saying we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2794)|
| 0:46:39| want to mirror what our state is doing with our schools here so how would that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2799)|
| 0:46:43| be different so in that case we may say okay so school a here's your demographics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2803)|
| 0:46:48| of each one of your students that generates X amount of dollars instead of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2808)|
| 0:46:52| 20 teachers and with some guardrails in place for example you can't go over BEP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2812)|
| 0:46:58| classroom size you have to have a principal maybe one AP you know in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2818)|
| 0:47:03| district and the board would build those guardrails out you get this much money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2823)|
| 0:47:07| to decide what you want your staff to look like and principals would love that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2827)|
| 0:47:13| I think because it does give them the flexibility to address the unique needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2833)|
| 0:47:16| of their building right it also comes over some some needed support because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2836)|
| 0:47:21| principals are the curriculum leaders of their building and a lot more than that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2841)|
| 0:47:25| but a lot of them don't want to be financial folks right and so that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2845)|
| 0:47:28| where the district would come in with with helping support if they'd ever move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2848)|
| 0:47:32| to that what would that potentially look like on that far right side even with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2852)|
| 0:47:36| that model I just described if the district ever went went through that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2856)|
| 0:47:39| process there are still things that the district would keep at the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2859)|
| 0:47:42| level or the central office level so and if you look at the students in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2862)|

| 0:47:51| right now to support students so at the top the school staff is the one we just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2871)|
| 0:47:55| talked about like and maybe instead of sending out a specific number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2875)|
| 0:47:58| positions we help them build that staff with available dollars we don't actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2878)|
| 0:48:03| send the dollars to them and then send them back because that would be a waste| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2883)|
| 0:48:06| of time but we're just saying here's your bucket of money and let us let us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2886)|
| 0:48:10| help you build what you need at your school school utilities and maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2890)|
| 0:48:14| I can't see us ever saying you know let's get KUB to send that bill to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2894)|
| 0:48:18| school for the electricity right so that would still be handled centrally back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2898)|
| 0:48:22| the left at the top transportation that's that still makes sense to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2902)|
| 0:48:26| handled centrally or at the district level and then on around the circle you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2906)|
| 0:48:30| can see some of those things it does make sense to purchase at the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2910)|

| 0:48:38| give that school leader the flexibility to make the call on how much of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2918)|
| 0:48:44| resources they need okay I think someone's back up okay so so based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2924)|
| 0:48:56| some of the things that that Joe shared with you mr. Snyder shared with you you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2936)|
| 0:49:00| you'll see that we've got some decisions to make the weaving the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2940)|

| 0:49:06| budget I do want to reiterate that the process that we are talking about today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2946)|
| 0:49:11| we believe is the right process to bring you all a budget that uses the resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2951)|
| 0:49:18| we have to have the greatest impact on student outcomes and also this year we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2958)|
| 0:49:24| have some factors that are gonna that are going to provide for some difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2964)|
| 0:49:28| decisions so so two separate things we believe this is the right process in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2968)|
| 0:49:33| years that are lean in years that are not but this year specifically we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2973)|
| 0:49:38| have a couple of things to consider in in building that proposed budget the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2978)|
| 0:49:42| flattening to set increase as Joe mentioned there is not going to be an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=2982)|

| 0:50:07| some decisions we need to make there are a lot of district initiatives some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=3007)|
| 0:50:11| those being staff members that are currently funded out of ESSER so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=3011)|
| 0:50:15| figuring out how how to continue that the initiatives that are proving to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=3015)|
| 0:50:20| successful and and all of those will compete with with several other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=3020)|

| 0:50:37| fixed increases that mr. Snyder referenced so so how do we consider all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=3037)|
| 0:50:43| those things to bring you all what we believe is the the best proposed budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=3043)|

| 0:51:35| so every line item in the budget is associated with the priority that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=3095)|
| 0:51:40| supports as well as classifying each line item in the budget based on success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=3100)|

| 0:54:34| tweaks can we do with staffing certain classes of positions at the school level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=3274)|

| 1:03:52| although we may choose to do that in the future correct correct we we believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=3832)|
| 1:03:57| that the student focused stewardship is bringing you all a proposed budget that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=3837)|
| 1:04:02| that aligns the resources we have to have the greatest impact on student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=3842)|
| 1:04:06| outcomes it is not what is traditionally known as student based budgeting right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=3846)|
| 1:04:10| so the the TISA model is a student based funding model and like mr. Snyder said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=3850)|
| 1:04:17| most districts at that that are funded in that way do explore whether it makes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=3857)|
| 1:04:22| sense to move to a student based budgeting model we are not there yet but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=3862)|
| 1:04:26| that is something that the staffing committee is helping us continue to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=3866)|
| 1:04:28| explore over the course thank you I just because the terms are so similar I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=3868)|
| 1:04:32| wanted to be right real clear on that that you all were saying the same thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=3872)|
| 1:04:35| and not two different things the other thing that I wanted to ask was well now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=3875)|

| 1:04:58| kind of what you're asking people to consider when they're bringing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=3898)|
| 1:05:02| budgets to the district around both looking at outcomes are we putting our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=3902)|
| 1:05:06| dollars in the things that have the greatest effect and also aligning them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=3906)|
| 1:05:10| to the priorities to me that's what I was hearing is the biggest shift in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=3910)|
| 1:05:13| process is that accurate yes first I just want to say well I just want to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=3913)|

| 1:05:44| into the actual budget season so I really appreciate that and the update I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=3944)|
| 1:05:49| think this will be a more challenging budget cycle than we've had in a in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=3949)|
| 1:05:53| handful of years so so I think this conversation today will also help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=3953)|
| 1:05:59| because I think as you guys know it's going to be a really really a challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=3959)|
| 1:06:04| so I appreciate the I as mr. Watson said I do appreciate aligning the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=3964)|
| 1:06:10| priorities with each budget each line item and I also appreciate that you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=3970)|

| 1:06:21| neutral or down 5% I think that that's where we have to be at this point and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=3981)|
| 1:06:26| that's a realistic view so I really appreciate that so I although I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=3986)|
| 1:06:32| looking forward to the budget cycle because it's going to be hard I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=3992)|
| 1:06:34| appreciate the work that you're doing that will help make sure that we can see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=3994)|

| 1:07:01| questions I noticed I know that we mentioned that the capital needs come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4021)|
| 1:07:03| out of a different location but you have capital needs and the effect that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4023)|
| 1:07:07| have on on the budget in this presentation I know we put a big chunk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4027)|
| 1:07:12| down on that to try and because I know one point we're pulling out of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4032)|
| 1:07:16| general purpose to continue to pay for that because we were kind of over that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4036)|
| 1:07:19| limit with the county or if have we reduced that are we are we out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4039)|
| 1:07:23| pulling from the general purpose at this point yet or are we I don't know who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4043)|
| 1:07:27| answers that I'll let mr. Snyder take that in more detail there there still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4047)|
| 1:07:33| will be debt service and and capital related items that come out of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4053)|
| 1:07:39| general purpose budget and I'll let mr. Snyder answer more specifically on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4059)|
| 1:07:43| so it's a great question so if you remember last year I think after budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4063)|
| 1:07:48| approval the county actually moved some pennies from our property tax revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4068)|
| 1:07:53| back into the county's debt service fund and so the way that generally works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4073)|
| 1:07:59| is the the property tax in of itself a portion of that is supposed to go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4079)|
| 1:08:06| fund school buildings and school capital cost historically the school has not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4086)|
| 1:08:13| received enough of the property tax to cover all of our cost and so we had to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4093)|
| 1:08:18| move some of that into the general purpose budget so looking at what did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4098)|
| 1:08:21| that look like this year our portion of the general purpose budget was 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4101)|
| 1:08:25| million dollars that we had to also use it to help so I think our total our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4105)|
| 1:08:31| total investment this year was 35 million so we put 25 million extra into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4111)|
| 1:08:37| it this year as a one-time payment and it helps in a couple of ways it goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4117)|
| 1:08:40| back to that realized savings that we're going to see rolling into next year and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4120)|
| 1:08:44| we can talk about what how much of that do you use next year and maybe save to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4124)|
| 1:08:48| fiscal year 26 but it also using it to pay down make that big of a payment on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4128)|
| 1:08:53| one-time debt also reduces a significant obligation on future debt payments in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4133)|
| 1:08:58| that case okay thank you I appreciate that and then just one other comment I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4138)|
| 1:09:03| this student-centered I know there's some discussion on the terminology there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4143)|
| 1:09:07| but just the idea of allowing principals the opportunity to make some of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4147)|
| 1:09:11| decisions for themselves I am I'm a fan of that I think we have some incredibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4151)|
| 1:09:15| smart and talented principals that could could figure that out for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4155)|
| 1:09:19| themselves locally in their in their building you know kind of better than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4159)|
| 1:09:25| maybe we could at the district level and you know certainly give them the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4165)|
| 1:09:29| freedoms kind of untie their hands in some ways and obviously with support and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4169)|
| 1:09:33| guardrails and all those things but that that model is very interesting to me and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4173)|
| 1:09:37| I think I think it'd be certainly great to dive into that explore that pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4177)|
| 1:09:40| good I would agree with that miss I win thank you madam chair there's a piece of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4180)|
| 1:09:49| the timeline that kind of worries me a little bit and I may not remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4189)|
| 1:09:53| correctly it seems that in the past the voting meeting has been somewhere mid to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4193)|
| 1:09:59| late April so that if there was something that needed to be changed we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4199)|
| 1:10:04| still had time that we could vote on it at the main meeting before it had to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4204)|
| 1:10:08| to Commission so in this timeline if we don't vote until the May meeting then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4208)|
| 1:10:15| that that may make it quite difficult if there's something that needed to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4215)|
| 1:10:19| changed if there was something that we didn't agree with that's a good point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4219)|
| 1:10:24| miss Owen and that may be an error on our timeline I believe that the special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4224)|
| 1:10:29| called budget meeting is already set for a date in April okay thank you for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4229)|
| 1:10:34| yeah I'm pretty sure it's on the calendar for April 25th I believe well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4234)|
| 1:10:38| we will correct that on our timeline thank you mr. Watson thank you madam| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4238)|
| 1:10:45| chair going back to the comment I made earlier about priorities and outcomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4245)|
| 1:10:50| you know in a in a budget year budget years where it's not as tight you still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4250)|
| 1:10:56| have trade-offs to make but it's easier to make those decisions right because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4256)|
| 1:10:59| you can do more of what you want to do but in education finance and like most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4259)|
| 1:11:04| finance everything's a trade-off right there's there's great things and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4264)|
| 1:11:07| can't do them all and so what I would I don't know that we typically at a board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4267)|
| 1:11:12| level at least have had conversations and in that type of way where we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4272)|
| 1:11:18| options where it's like hey we could do this and this is the outback and this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4278)|
| 1:11:22| the outcome and this is what the cost might be or we could do this but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4282)|
| 1:11:25| probably can't do both and I think especially in a tight year like this I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4285)|
| 1:11:30| would advocate for you all as you're talking and engaging the board to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4290)|
| 1:11:33| us understand where some of those levers are and I think that's where we actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4293)|
| 1:11:37| might be able to chime in and have some hopefully some positive influence in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4297)|
| 1:11:42| but I think it'll be tough if we if we just get you're all here's here's what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4302)|
| 1:11:46| we really want to do as a district it's kind of hard for us to know where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4306)|
| 1:11:49| other opportunities might lie and I think because you guys are already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4309)|
| 1:11:54| aligning or already asking everybody in the district to align their budget line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4314)|
| 1:11:59| items to priorities and outcomes to me that should be a much easier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4319)|
| 1:12:01| conversation because the works already been done I think we just need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4321)|
| 1:12:05| structure that conversation that way at the board level thank you thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4325)|
| 1:12:11| anyone else that's Christy yes and thank you and I echo the sentiments of everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4331)|
| 1:12:18| else and we talked about this when I came in but when we say 80% of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4338)|
| 1:12:23| budget is people just to put that in perspective because this isn't a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4343)|
| 1:12:28| election year and I've already heard County Commission candidates talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4348)|
| 1:12:32| the big percentage of the budget that the school district gets can you remind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4352)|

| 1:12:45| employees across the district is almost 36 million all right and that does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4365)|
| 1:12:50| include transportation or does that it though be our employees right so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4370)|
| 1:12:56| does not include best drivers so I do think that that you know to say 80% but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4376)|
| 1:13:02| when you talk in terms of hundreds of millions of dollars I do think that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4382)|
| 1:13:06| is important for people to realize how much comes out every month just for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4386)|

| 1:18:29| they've conducted several focus groups 21 I believe all of all of the work that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4709)|

| 1:18:38| recommendations will I think I may be getting ahead of myself let's let's talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4718)|
| 1:18:43| about employee outreach first so the outreach survey we got over over 30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4723)|
| 1:18:48| percent about 30 percent response rate so all of our employees had the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4728)|
| 1:18:52| opportunity to participate in the survey we did a job assessment tool that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4732)|
| 1:18:58| was released to 479 recipients and we got an over 50 percent response rate and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4738)|
| 1:19:04| the reason that you see that released to less recipients then then the outreach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4744)|
| 1:19:10| survey is that there are large the job assessment tool is looking at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4750)|

| 1:21:13| proposed budget to the board that was very high-level overview but specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4873)|
| 1:21:20| questions on the salary study Reverend Butler thank you madam chair thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4880)|
| 1:21:26| for the presentation can you define and explain compression one more time sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4886)|
| 1:21:36| go back so compression is variation in salaries between employees with with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4896)|
| 1:21:44| with different level of significance or responsibilities it can can look at like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4904)|
| 1:21:49| two types of things so when pay between subordinates and supervisors is too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4909)|
| 1:21:54| close so are we are we appropriately providing opportunities for growth for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4914)|
| 1:22:00| our employees and then also when pay of highly tenured staff and new employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4920)|
| 1:22:06| are too close are we providing appropriate progression in salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4926)|
| 1:22:11| schedules themselves to give an opportunity for growth within positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4931)|
| 1:22:16| so for example if we go to $50,000 for teachers who are coming in and we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4936)|
| 1:22:25| to look at what are those who are being here for a while what are they getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4945)|
| 1:22:29| and when does that what is the number of years or not years of experience that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4949)|
| 1:22:34| that demands an increase or not right so so we will if adjusting if we take that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4954)|
| 1:22:42| example so by we know by FY 27 that the starting teacher salary will be 50,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4962)|
| 1:22:47| in order to to accommodate that one of one of their recommendations would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4967)|
| 1:22:52| that the the rest of the salary schedule moves to so that we're not we're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4972)|
| 1:22:58| just in increasing so that so that we're still creating an opportunity for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4978)|
| 1:23:02| growth for employees. Mr. Watson. Thank you Madam Chair. Thank you Ms. Hemelgarn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4982)|
| 1:23:10| So one question in response to the last question would that compression piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4990)|
| 1:23:15| also look if there's too much distance between salary ranges in those examples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=4995)|
| 1:23:20| that you mentioned or is it just whether or not it's too close? Both. Okay so it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=5000)|
| 1:23:25| not just compression but it's also expansion. Right and is our you know if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=5005)|
| 1:23:31| we have a salary schedule of step zero to step 20 is is the midpoint truly the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=5011)|
| 1:23:39| midpoint do we have the appropriate level of differences between each of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=5019)|
| 1:23:44| steps as well? Okay I would assume not but would the study also tell us I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=5024)|
| 1:23:51| assume that we don't have any positions the study may tell us but whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=5031)|
| 1:23:55| we any of our positions are over market I'm not asking this because at some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=5035)|
| 1:23:59| point I'm going to advocate that we reduce them I'm just asking does it look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=5039)|
| 1:24:02| at both does it look at positions that are under market and also where we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=5042)|
| 1:24:06| paying over market for positions? Yes so it looks at where our positions are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=5046)|
| 1:24:11| compared to market so that will tell us if they are over or under. Okay yes and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=5051)|
| 1:24:16| then I heard what I heard your description about how you chose who to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=5056)|
| 1:24:22| send the job assessment tool to I didn't really get what the job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=5062)|

| 1:42:36| doing, but I do believe that having a budget neutral and a five percent, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=6156)|
| 1:42:51| would the term be used, five percent reduction, thank you, five percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=6171)|
| 1:42:57| reduction, that would be, that's smart, but also I think we need to also say we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=6177)|
| 1:43:05| want to have an accurate amount of what it's going to take to do what we say we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=6185)|
| 1:43:10| want to do, and if that's more than the five percent, more than budget neutral, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=6190)|
| 1:43:17| have to acknowledge that, because either we have to have the budget that we say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=6197)|
| 1:43:21| we're going to need, or we got to, if you're not going to raise the budget, you got to lower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=6201)|

| 1:43:34| state that budget amount. If we don't get that, then of course we have to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=6214)|
| 1:43:39| something different, but if you don't ask for it, you don't get it. I'm not trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=6219)|

| 1:47:07| take to accomplish our mission, regardless of whether or not we have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=6427)|
| 1:47:10| funding to do it, and that's not really out in the public eye, it's very hard to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=6430)|
| 1:47:15| kind of drum up the energy to go out there and say, hey this is what we got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=6435)|
| 1:47:19| we know, we're grateful and all the things, and we're going to do this with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=6439)|
| 1:47:22| it, we're going to prioritize and all the stuff, but here's what we really need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=6442)|
| 1:47:25| get to, right? And I do think it's important for us to, I know it's a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=6445)|
| 1:47:32| work, I mean you all budget all year round, I mean Snyder and his crew, I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=6452)|
| 1:47:36| they're just cranking numbers, right? All the time, I mean I get it, but I think it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=6456)|
| 1:47:41| would also behoove the district and the school board and our other people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=6461)|
| 1:47:47| can help, other folks who can help impact the revenues that actually come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=6467)|
| 1:47:50| from a legislative standpoint to understand like what is it going to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=6470)|
| 1:47:54| to accomplish our mission, first and foremost, even if we don't have all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=6474)|
| 1:47:58| revenue to do it in this particular moment. And so I don't know how we get to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=6478)|
| 1:48:02| that as well, which I think is what my colleagues are advocating for, but I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=6482)|
| 1:48:06| think it's important for us to consider and to be aware of, because whether or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=6486)|
| 1:48:11| not it's budget neutral or five percent below, I think all of us in this room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=6491)|
| 1:48:15| probably agree that's not actually what it's going to take to accomplish our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=6495)|
| 1:48:18| mission. It's probably something different than that, right? Even though we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=6498)|
| 1:48:21| can't get it. So I wasn't planning on talking about that at all, but you did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=6501)|

| 1:51:42| are going to be sacrifices. I also agree with having being budget neutral or, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-240125?start=6702)|
