| 2:15:46| I'm in agreement with Commissioner Pinkston in that we need to see what happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8146)|
| 2:15:51| and transpires through the Attorney General's office and through the district attorney's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8151)|
| 2:15:55| But I would be in favor of keeping Mr. Bosch on at this time because we don't know what's going to happen down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8155)|
| 2:16:01| Now, he doesn't get paid unless the meter runs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8161)|
| 2:16:04| He doesn't get paid unless one of us calls him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8164)|
| 2:16:06| And I think that each of us on commission needs to be responsible enough to say, okay, let's wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8166)|
| 2:16:12| We have him if we need him, but we don't need him right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8172)|
| 2:16:15| There may come a time later down the road where we do need to pick up the phone and have meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8175)|
| 2:16:19| So I would be in favor of keeping Mr. Bosch because, like I say, he's not going to get paid unless the meter runs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8179)|
| 2:16:24| but to say to us as commissioners, let's not make that phone call unless and until there is a reason to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8184)|
| 2:16:31| Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman, I'd like to ask a point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8191)|
| 2:16:36| Are we on page?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8196)|
| 2:16:38| We're on page 28.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8198)|
| 2:16:39| In discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8199)|
| 2:16:41| Review of the hospitality audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8201)|
| 2:16:43| So?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8203)|
| 2:16:44| After that, we will go to 921, which is to relinquish the services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8204)|
| 2:16:49| And then my next question is, Mr. Commissioner Lambert, does he have a something deferral motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8209)|
| 2:16:56| I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8216)|
| 2:16:57| He didn't get a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8217)|
| 2:16:58| But I'll make that again as a substitute motion if somebody will second me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8218)|
| 2:17:02| What exactly are you trying to defer, Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8222)|
| 2:17:04| Well, I just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8224)|
| 2:17:05| Well, let me point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8225)|
| 2:17:09| What we're on now is nothing but the review of the hospitality audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8229)|
| 2:17:14| 921 will come after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8234)|
| 2:17:16| Oh, okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8236)|
| 2:17:17| Well, mine relates to 921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8237)|
| 2:17:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8241)|
| 2:17:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8242)|
| 2:17:23| I would ask for end of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8243)|
| 2:17:25| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8245)|
| 2:17:26| What I've asked for is no discussion at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8246)|
| 2:17:29| And I'm agreeing with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8249)|
| 2:17:32| We don't need to be talking about this anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8252)|
| 2:17:34| Can we get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8254)|
| 2:17:37| Roll call vote starting in the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8257)|
| 2:17:41| This is the cut debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8261)|
| 2:17:45| Can you explain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8265)|

| 2:18:52| It's the handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8332)|
| 2:18:54| You read it into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8334)|
| 2:18:57| This is a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8337)|
| 2:19:01| to relinquish the services of Attorneys Don Bosch and Ann Short Bowers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8341)|
| 2:19:06| Do we have a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8346)|
| 2:19:10| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8350)|
| 2:19:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8352)|
| 2:19:14| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8354)|
| 2:19:17| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8357)|
| 2:19:20| Do we have another motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8360)|
| 2:19:23| Substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8363)|
| 2:19:24| No motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8364)|
| 2:19:27| I've got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8367)|
| 2:19:28| This is 9-21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8368)|
| 2:19:31| If you don't have a substitute, it fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8371)|
| 2:19:32| Well, hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8372)|
| 2:19:34| If it died of lack of a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8374)|
| 2:19:36| I'd like to amend that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8376)|
| 2:19:38| I'd vote for it with an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8378)|
| 2:19:40| I'd like to amend it to retain him until the new law director comes in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8380)|
| 2:19:45| to see what we can get his advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8385)|
| 2:19:48| Commissioner Pinkston,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8388)|
| 2:19:49| what if you kept him safe until the next commission meeting so we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8389)|
| 2:19:53| publicly see what the new law director says if he has a conflict?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8393)|
| 2:19:58| I can go along with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8398)|
| 2:19:59| I'll take that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8399)|
| 2:20:01| Commissioner Pinkston, why don't you just add it to next month's agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8401)|
| 2:20:06| or defer this until next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8406)|
| 2:20:07| Would you take that as a friendly amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8407)|
| 2:20:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8408)|
| 2:20:10| I'll second her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8410)|
| 2:20:13| So what's your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8413)|
| 2:20:15| I believe the motion is to defer until next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8415)|
| 2:20:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8417)|
| 2:20:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8418)|
| 2:20:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8419)|
| 2:20:20| The motion was is to keep him on until the next commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8420)|
| 2:20:26| And she took that as a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8426)|
| 2:20:28| No, that's your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8428)|
| 2:20:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8429)|
| 2:20:30| I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8430)|
| 2:20:37| Commissioner Ballot, do you second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8437)|
| 2:20:39| That was to extend it until the next commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8439)|
| 2:20:41| No, that's the motion I'm about to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8441)|
| 2:20:43| No, I misunderstood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8443)|
| 2:20:45| I have a substitute motion that we extend it to the next commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8445)|
| 2:20:49| Commissioner Pinkston, it would achieve the same goals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8449)|
| 2:20:52| I'm for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8452)|
| 2:20:53| I thought you would defer it for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8453)|
| 2:20:55| Well, if we just keep him on until the new law director comes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8455)|
| 2:21:02| then if the law director says I'm conflicted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8462)|
| 2:21:05| then we have no counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8465)|
| 2:21:06| By deferring it for 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8466)|
| 2:21:08| then we give the new law director a chance to weigh in on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8468)|
| 2:21:12| and we can think about whether we need counsel or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8472)|
| 2:21:15| Do you want to make a motion to substitute to defer it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8475)|
| 2:21:18| I'm making a substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8478)|
| 2:21:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8479)|
| 2:21:20| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8480)|
| 2:21:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8481)|
| 2:21:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8482)|
| 2:21:23| Now debating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8483)|
| 2:21:24| Now I see lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8484)|
| 2:21:25| What about me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8485)|
| 2:21:26| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8486)|
| 2:21:27| I think I agree that we can defer this until the new law director gets on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8487)|
| 2:21:32| But what I foresee us having the situation facing is it's going to be the same thing that happens with Mr. Owings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8492)|
| 2:21:39| is he says there's going to be a conflict just because of the position where he's not going to be able to advise us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8499)|
| 2:21:45| And then there's going to be the second issue of the counsel to the mayor being a former law partner of the new law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8505)|
| 2:21:52| And that's going to be a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8512)|
| 2:21:55| We can put the decision off a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8515)|
| 2:21:57| but I just don't see how we're going to get around not retaining our own attorney here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8517)|
| 2:22:01| because there's going to be questions that are going to come up and we're not going to have anyone to turn to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8521)|
| 2:22:06| I anticipate that what we'll see is there will be a lot of silence for the next three to six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8526)|
| 2:22:12| and we're going to want to know what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8532)|
| 2:22:15| I think all we can do by talking publicly about it is harm a good investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8535)|
| 2:22:22| So, I mean, I really would be in favor of us going ahead and retaining the present counsel that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8542)|
| 2:22:29| I just don't see why a new law director coming on board is going to change that any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8549)|
| 2:22:34| Mr. Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8554)|
| 2:22:36| That was part of my same question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8556)|
| 2:22:38| If Mr. Bosch, if we relinquish his service, does Bud Gilbert still represent the mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8558)|
| 2:22:45| And if so, then they have someone to talk to and we have no one that we could really talk to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8565)|
| 2:22:52| I mean, we would have the law director, but he's going to have his hands full right now getting started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8572)|
| 2:22:58| So I just think if, you know, I don't know that we need to call him, but if we need him, he'll be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8578)|
| 2:23:05| Commissioner DeFries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8585)|
| 2:23:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8588)|
| 2:23:10| Don Bosch, I would just like to know, you've said that you've met with some commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8590)|
| 2:23:15| and you've talked to some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8595)|
| 2:23:16| How many hours are you at already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8596)|
| 2:23:19| Commissioner DeFries, I have not run our bill at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8599)|
| 2:23:22| but I would anticipate that it is probably less than 20 or 25 total lawyer hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8602)|
| 2:23:27| and that counts Ms. Short's time at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8607)|
| 2:23:30| Please understand that's an estimate, but we did not come here today with a bill in hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8610)|
| 2:23:35| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8615)|
| 2:23:36| We keep that daily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8616)|
| 2:23:37| But as I've told the folks that have been able to get in and see us, that, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8617)|
| 2:23:42| it's not like we're sitting there and drafting potential examinations of the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8622)|
| 2:23:48| and the mayor's staff that might appear given the new developments in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8628)|
| 2:23:53| The majority of our time has been spent talking and meeting with the commissioners that have called us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8633)|
| 2:23:58| Frankly, it was our intention by way of our first letter to try to contact each of you all to schedule those times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8638)|
| 2:24:05| but a number of the commissioners have been proactive, have called,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8645)|
| 2:24:08| and they've kept us plenty busy with those phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8648)|
| 2:24:11| I think outside of a phone call I've made to Commissioner Pinkston and another to Commissioner Davis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8651)|
| 2:24:17| those were the only contacts that we initiated in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8657)|
| 2:24:21| The other contacts to us have been initiated by commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8661)|
| 2:24:24| The other types of things that we've done is we have met with the parties and talked with the parties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8664)|
| 2:24:29| and that would beg a question I have for this body in that what frequency would, if at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8669)|
| 2:24:36| you care for us to continue our contact with General Cooper's office for their sort of status updates as to what's happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8676)|
| 2:24:44| We've spoken with them as recently as this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8684)|
| 2:24:47| And we don't regularly call them or call them daily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8687)|
| 2:24:50| but we have kept that line of communication open in expressing what this body has expressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8690)|
| 2:24:56| We hope that they will move whatever decisions they make with due deliberance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8696)|
| 2:25:01| and to go forward and to come to resolution on this issue, whatever it may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8701)|
| 2:25:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8706)|
| 2:25:07| I just don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8707)|
| 2:25:09| They could only act as a flashlight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8709)|
| 2:25:12| This has been such a difficult subject,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8712)|
| 2:25:17| and I think it's in the hands that it needs to be, and you know my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8717)|
| 2:25:23| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8723)|
| 2:25:26| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8726)|
| 2:25:29| No, I turned my light off, but I turned it back on quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8729)|
| 2:25:34| Both go to the bottom then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8734)|
| 2:25:36| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8736)|
| 2:25:38| I agree with Commissioner Briggs in that I don't think we need to do anything right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8738)|
| 2:25:43| I have complete trust in Mr. Owens for advising us that we need to have counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8743)|
| 2:25:49| and I am confident with the counsel standing in the docket,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8749)|
| 2:25:54| and whether it's for a month or two months or three months, whatever that length of time needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8754)|
| 2:25:59| So I see us not taking any action right now and leaving things the way they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8759)|
| 2:26:06| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8766)|
| 2:26:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8768)|
| 2:26:10| Commissioner Wright, that's the point I was trying to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8770)|
| 2:26:12| and I was going to make again is for Commissioner Pinkston could bring this back next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8772)|
| 2:26:19| What's proposed right now is the same as taking no action today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8779)|
| 2:26:25| By taking no action, Mr. Bosch continues to do what he's doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8785)|
| 2:26:31| and next month we can decide whether or not we need to continue with him in the role that he's in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8791)|
| 2:26:38| And we could do that at our next meeting without having to vote to go to the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8798)|
| 2:26:42| So I just don't believe we need to take any action because he's already hired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8802)|
| 2:26:48| By us taking no action today, he just continues to do what he's doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8808)|
| 2:26:55| and next month we'll decide whether or not we feel like as a commission we need to retain him or not retain him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8815)|
| 2:27:04| Point of order, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8824)|
| 2:27:07| If we take no action on this today, if this dies for lack of a motion, will it not be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8827)|
| 2:27:16| can it be put back on the agenda next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8836)|
| 2:27:19| That's what I'm curious about, if we take no action today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8839)|
| 2:27:24| What I would advise you would be that it would take a two-thirds vote to add it back to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8844)|
| 2:27:30| Basically, there's been a motion to approve which wasn't seconded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8850)|
| 2:27:38| and maybe it was seconded with an amendment, but that's a consideration of the merits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8858)|
| 2:27:42| If you're going to consider the merits, then you've got to go to your rules and you have to wait 60 days to bring it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8862)|
| 2:27:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8869)|
| 2:27:50| Or you can suspend the rules and consider it at the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8870)|
| 2:27:53| Then I hope folks will stand with me on postponing for 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8873)|
| 2:27:58| so that that will have the option of hearing it at the next meeting without a super majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8878)|
| 2:28:03| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8883)|
| 2:28:06| The only thing I'd like to add is that, Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8886)|
| 2:28:10| is it possible to have these two attorneys in this case submit their bills every month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8890)|
| 2:28:15| so the Commission would know how much is being billed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8895)|
| 2:28:19| I'm sure they will submit their bills on a monthly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8899)|
| 2:28:22| I have not received one from Don and Ann, nor have we received one from Bud, but they're a public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8902)|
| 2:28:31| They are submitted and they're reviewed and they take a course through finance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8911)|
| 2:28:37| and the bills are paid after they've been properly reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8917)|
| 2:28:42| But is it possible to-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8922)|
| 2:28:43| We had planned on submitting monthly bills and there will be a bill in this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8923)|
| 2:28:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8927)|
| 2:28:48| Just so the public will know and you don't go three months out and then some big bill shows up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8928)|
| 2:28:52| and we sit back and say, well, we shouldn't have called him that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8932)|
| 2:28:56| So if we can just get both those bills maybe in our packets every month if they do come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8936)|
| 2:29:01| Well, I know you'll want to keep a watch on it for fiscal oversight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8941)|
| 2:29:06| but they are there for a reason and they're there for a good reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8946)|
| 2:29:11| and that is to advise you when you have a question about these two audits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8951)|
| 2:29:15| And so I would encourage you to use them when you need them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8955)|
| 2:29:20| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8960)|
| 2:29:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8962)|
| 2:29:23| Mr. Bosch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8963)|
| 2:29:24| I'll point out I have not been elected to this body yet, nor will I serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8964)|
| 2:29:28| So Mr. Bosch is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8968)|
| 2:29:32| If we hire you and we discuss this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8972)|
| 2:29:34| what power or authority do we have to dismiss charges against the mayor or charge him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8974)|
| 2:29:41| Mr. Pinkston, I think that's a good question that I think has been answered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8981)|
| 2:29:44| and I will certainly state it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8984)|
| 2:29:47| I think it's been clear that this body has little authority to remove the mayor or the mayor's staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8987)|
| 2:29:53| and I think that that issue has been vetted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8993)|
| 2:29:57| and it's clear that this body does not have that authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=8997)|
| 2:30:02| In suggesting what can this body do, I think really as much as anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9002)|
| 2:30:09| the duty this body has to the community to expose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9009)|
| 2:30:12| and explain to its constituents and its voters what has happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9012)|
| 2:30:16| and what is happening is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9016)|
| 2:30:18| I also think that issues, rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9018)|
| 2:30:22| things that can be passed and promulgated by this body to address future conduct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9022)|
| 2:30:28| might be important in light of this learning experience, frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9028)|
| 2:30:31| and that's going to be for this body to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9031)|
| 2:30:33| But to specifically answer your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9033)|
| 2:30:36| this body has a right to question these people before it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9036)|
| 2:30:40| to question them under oath, to conduct a variety of hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9040)|
| 2:30:44| In terms of action, other than exposing to the extent it wishes to what those actions might be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9044)|
| 2:30:51| there is little authority that this board or this commission has to remove either an elected office holder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9051)|
| 2:30:58| in this case the mayor, or the mayor's staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9058)|
| 2:31:01| With an attorney-client privilege, we should talk to you before anything comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9061)|
| 2:31:08| Can we talk to you in private before it comes up up here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9068)|
| 2:31:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9071)|
| 2:31:12| I would be looking for you to advise me, if I asked you something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9072)|
| 2:31:18| that you should tell me whether or not we should discuss it to whether or not it would hinder the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9078)|
| 2:31:24| I have been attempting to do that with each and every question that's posed to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9084)|
| 2:31:27| and I would certainly do that with any commissioner that would want to meet with me in private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9087)|
| 2:31:31| and ask those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9091)|
| 2:31:32| That is our role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9092)|
| 2:31:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9093)|
| 2:31:34| I want to be sure we can meet with you in private.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9094)|
| 2:31:35| The reason why I'm saying that is I do not want to do anything to involve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9095)|
| 2:31:40| When I talked to you, I told you that the attorney general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9100)|
| 2:31:44| and the district attorney would not be checking into the charter violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9104)|
| 2:31:50| Are you going to be talking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9110)|
| 2:31:51| Can we talk to you about that, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9111)|
| 2:31:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9113)|
| 2:31:54| Because I feel like there has been some charter violations that they're not investigating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9114)|
| 2:32:02| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9122)|
| 2:32:04| Yes, I just wanted to remind everyone again that this is a fluid situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9124)|
| 2:32:08| and this is our last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9128)|
| 2:32:10| And so this body will change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9130)|
| 2:32:12| and I don't want to make a decision about counsel that maybe the incoming commissioners may want to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9132)|
| 2:32:20| And so we shouldn't remove a tool from the toolbox that they may feel is necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9140)|
| 2:32:27| I'd like to call for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9147)|
| 2:32:29| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9149)|
| 2:32:32| Got your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9152)|
| 2:32:33| Got a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9153)|
| 2:32:35| Got a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9155)|
| 2:32:37| Where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9157)|
| 2:32:38| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9158)|
| 2:32:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9159)|
| 2:32:40| Well, just a question on, you know, like was kind of said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9160)|
| 2:32:46| we're discussing ways on not doing something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9166)|
| 2:32:50| so I'm trying to figure out the best way not to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9170)|
| 2:32:53| If we don't act on this at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9173)|
| 2:32:55| so we will continue on our law director's recommendation of Mr. Bosch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9175)|
| 2:33:05| If in 30 days, 45 days, 60 days, we decide that that services are no longer desired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9185)|
| 2:33:13| would the new law director be the only one that can not retain his services anymore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9193)|
| 2:33:20| Is it a month-to-month thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9200)|
| 2:33:22| Or can we come in at any time and say we want the clock to stop at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9202)|
| 2:33:27| And I don't know who that question is directed at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9207)|
| 2:33:32| Mr. Bosch was hired by me and at your direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9212)|
| 2:33:39| and you can ask for his services to be terminated at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9219)|
| 2:33:45| He's already said it wouldn't hurt his feelings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9225)|
| 2:33:50| That would not answer the question about the mayor's council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9230)|
| 2:33:54| but I would encourage you to keep the lines of communication open, whether you use them or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9234)|
| 2:34:01| Okay, yeah, so I'm kind of in agreement with Commissioners Wright and Briggs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9241)|
| 2:34:06| in that I think we need to continue on with the direction we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9246)|
| 2:34:11| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9251)|
| 2:34:13| Mr. Chairman, if we were to be at a point where there was not a motion on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9253)|
| 2:34:20| could we move on with the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9260)|
| 2:34:22| I'd love to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9262)|
| 2:34:24| Is there a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9264)|
| 2:34:25| I have a substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9265)|
| 2:34:27| Who has it on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9267)|
| 2:34:29| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9269)|
| 2:34:30| Mr. Lambert, Mr. Commissioner Lambert, would you withdraw your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9270)|
| 2:34:35| That's what I was going to ask as well, if we withdrew everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9275)|
| 2:34:38| We withdrew everything, though, since we have deliberated on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9278)|
| 2:34:42| It would require a two-thirds vote to bring this back up at the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9282)|
| 2:34:47| Mr. Law Director, could you answer that real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9287)|
| 2:34:49| No, if you're basically going to withdraw all motions, then the merits have not been considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9289)|
| 2:34:55| You can bring it back up at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9295)|
| 2:34:56| You can bring it back up next month or the month after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9296)|
| 2:34:59| If you move to defer, you can bring it back next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9299)|
| 2:35:02| You can accomplish that either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9302)|
| 2:35:06| I'll withdraw my motion if that would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9306)|
| 2:35:11| Does the second agree to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9311)|
| 2:35:13| I don't think he ever had a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9313)|
| 2:35:15| Yeah, we had a second to his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9315)|
| 2:35:17| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9317)|
| 2:35:19| The original motion is to pass this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9319)|
| 2:35:21| I'll withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9321)|
| 2:35:24| You withdraw?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9324)|
| 2:35:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9325)|
| 2:35:27| So no action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9327)|
| 2:35:32| That was my suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9332)|
| 2:35:34| I can't get a motion, so I guess there's no action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9334)|
| 2:35:38| Chairman Strickland, if I may, if I may suggest to this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9338)|
| 2:35:40| if any of you would, in fact, like to talk to us, instead of having us try to reach out and schedule meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9340)|
| 2:35:45| I would encourage any of you to call my office and we will schedule you immediately to talk if you so desire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9345)|
| 2:35:51| I think that will accomplish both this body's goals in discussing whatever they feel you need to discuss with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9351)|
| 2:35:56| and preserving attorney-client privilege without us having to spend any unnecessary time with those that do not wish to speak with us at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9356)|
| 2:36:03| What's that number and cell phone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9363)|
| 2:36:05| You know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9365)|
| 2:36:07| The public number is 637-2142.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9367)|
| 2:36:11| Well, it's much weight if you've lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9371)|
| 2:36:12| It looks like you need a saw to call you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9372)|
| 2:36:15| That's very kind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9375)|
| 2:36:16| Thank you, Mr. Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9376)|
| 2:36:18| Quick question, Don, before you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9378)|
| 2:36:20| You're talking about calling Mr. Cooper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9380)|
| 2:36:22| Is it not better for you just to sit tight until you hear from him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9382)|
| 2:36:27| I can tell you in my experience involved in these things that governmental lawyers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9387)|
| 2:36:32| and prosecutors aren't going to just sort of make the rounds and call people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9392)|
| 2:36:36| it usually takes a phone call from somebody with an interested party to say, can we get a status?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9396)|
| 2:36:41| We know that if we call every day, we're not going to get the same response that if we're measured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9401)|
| 2:36:47| and thoughtful about that phone call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9407)|
| 2:36:50| We have called every couple of weeks and asked for a status to the extent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9410)|
| 2:36:55| Those phone calls typically take less than 30 minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9415)|
| 2:36:59| and we have advised those commissioners that have been able to call, do you know a status?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9419)|
| 2:37:04| We have told them what we've been told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9424)|
| 2:37:07| That's our role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9427)|
| 2:37:09| I don't think that we can ask General Cooper's office to call us if there are developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9429)|
| 2:37:14| but I don't think just in a matter of over 20 years of experience in doing this that we would expect any calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9434)|
| 2:37:19| but we will follow this body's lead as to what it wants us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9439)|
| 2:37:23| So you feel like you need to call them just to keep things going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9443)|
| 2:37:26| I can tell you that we have been told that this is of the highest priority in the State Attorney General's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9446)|
| 2:37:33| They are paying a tremendous amount of attention to this and devoting a lot of resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9453)|
| 2:37:39| So I don't think this is a function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9459)|
| 2:37:42| If I don't call, it's not that they're going to stop working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9462)|
| 2:37:45| The question is when we call, we're able to better advise you as to what the status is as to what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9465)|
| 2:37:52| And I suspect, and I don't want to speak for Mr. Gilbert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9472)|
| 2:37:55| but if I'm in Mr. Gilbert's shoes, I'm making those exact calls on behalf of the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9475)|
| 2:38:00| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9480)|
| 2:38:03| Thank you, Don.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9483)|
| 2:38:04| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9484)|
| 2:38:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9485)|
| 2:38:07| If we're in order, it's page 25907.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9487)|
| 2:38:14| Page 25907.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9494)|
| 2:38:18| This is a resolution approving a report from Tax Management Associates, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9498)|
| 2:38:24| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9504)|
| 2:38:26| 9-0, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9506)|
| 2:38:27| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9507)|
| 2:38:28| 10-0, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9508)|
| 2:38:31| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9511)|
| 2:38:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9512)|
| 2:38:33| We've got Dale from Tax Management here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9513)|
| 2:38:36| I think he can maybe give us an update of what they've done so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9516)|
| 2:38:40| So, Dale, if you'll give a name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9520)|
| 2:38:43| Dale Baker with Tax Management Associates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9523)|
| 2:38:45| I reside at 2938 Melbourne Terrace, Mount Juliet, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9525)|
| 2:38:50| Currently we are involved with reviewing the pilot agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9530)|
| 2:38:56| We're reviewing ten of the 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9536)|
| 2:38:59| Six of the ten, we began the reviews in March, started with three of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9539)|
| 2:39:04| Six of the ten reviews or the agreements are for real property only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9544)|
| 2:39:10| Reviewing those agreements, it would appear that those are in compliance with the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9550)|
| 2:39:16| There are a couple of issues that we still have to review on a couple of the agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9556)|
| 2:39:22| We've been working with the Assessor's Properties Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9562)|
| 2:39:25| in making sure that the format in which we give the information to them is acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9565)|
| 2:39:31| I've met with them on a couple of occasions to show them that form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9571)|
| 2:39:35| but we are probably about 30 days away from finalizing the real property agreements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9575)|
| 2:39:41| that we are currently reviewing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9581)|
| 2:39:44| Four of the ten involve both real property and tangible business personal property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9584)|
| 2:39:50| In reviewing those agreements, at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9590)|
| 2:39:53| it appears that there may be some noncompliance on the tangible business personal property side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9593)|
| 2:39:58| as far as filing the proper property tax schedules each year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9598)|
| 2:40:03| to identify the assets that are owned by the IDB board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9603)|
| 2:40:09| And so at this time, we have got to do a little bit further review with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9609)|
| 2:40:14| We're going to have to schedule some financial reviews with those companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9614)|
| 2:40:18| to find out what exactly was transferred over to the board through a bill of sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9618)|
| 2:40:24| see what property that they might own on their own, whether it be some lease property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9624)|
| 2:40:30| consumable supplies, raw materials, CIP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9630)|
| 2:40:33| things that are historically not included on the agreement and in the bill of sale with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9633)|
| 2:40:39| And those are going to take a little bit longer time to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9639)|
| 2:40:42| But, like I say, at this time, we are currently involved with ten of the 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9642)|
| 2:40:46| Six of the ten are real property and would appear to be in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9646)|
| 2:40:51| Four of the ten have a little bit of an issue and they could potentially be in noncompliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9651)|
| 2:40:57| And we want to just bring that attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9657)|
| 2:40:59| We'll turn that information once we gather it over to the assessor of properties office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9659)|
| 2:41:03| and we'll give that to anybody who additionally needs that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9663)|
| 2:41:08| But that's where we're at currently on the reviewing of the agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9668)|
| 2:41:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9673)|
| 2:41:14| Dale, what four companies are potentially noncompliant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9674)|
| 2:41:19| Because what I'm hearing you say is they should have filed some kind of audits, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9679)|
| 2:41:25| or some kind of paperwork and they have failed to file those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9685)|
| 2:41:29| They should file a tangible personal property schedule each year just like a normal operating business would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9689)|
| 2:41:36| The equipment on there is conveyed over to the IDB and so it's exempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9696)|
| 2:41:42| But it goes on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9702)|
| 2:41:43| They file a return so that you can monitor that they're following the guidelines that are set out in their agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9703)|
| 2:41:49| whether it be a dollar limitation or whether it be an in lieu of or a percentage of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9709)|
| 2:41:56| You know, sometimes the agreement would read that you're paying a percentage of the overall tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9716)|
| 2:42:02| So you would need that return in order to evaluate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9722)|
| 2:42:07| The four that had both real property and personal property, one was Bush Brothers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9727)|
| 2:42:16| That particular agreement has expired, but if it was not in compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9736)|
| 2:42:20| there's potentially back assessment, reassessment for some of the older years on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9740)|
| 2:42:27| Knox News Sentinel is one that had both real property and tangible business personal property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9747)|
| 2:42:36| Exidy American Corp. was one that had both real property and tangible business personal property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9756)|
| 2:42:44| And Crippen slash Jackson, I think it's Swiss Tech,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9764)|
| 2:42:51| is also one that has real property and tangible business personal property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9771)|
| 2:42:58| Their agreement also expired, I believe, on 12-31-07,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9778)|
| 2:43:02| but there is potential if they weren't in compliance that there may be some back assessment, reassessment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9782)|
| 2:43:08| Those are the four that at this point in time that appear to be out of compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9788)|
| 2:43:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9792)|
| 2:43:13| And I guess at this point going forward you have contacted these individuals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9793)|
| 2:43:18| We have sent them a letter notifying them that we've been reviewing their IDB agreement between them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9798)|
| 2:43:25| and the board and the pilot agreement and that we need some additional information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9805)|
| 2:43:30| and that we will be contacting them to set up a time to come out and actually do financial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9810)|
| 2:43:35| the review of the books and records for the tangible business personal property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9815)|
| 2:43:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9820)|
| 2:43:41| And you said 30 days or 60 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9821)|
| 2:43:43| How long do you think it will be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9823)|
| 2:43:44| Well, on those, I'm going to be gone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9824)|
| 2:43:48| As soon as I leave, I'm out of town for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9828)|
| 2:43:50| I will contact them and I will get them scheduled as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9830)|
| 2:43:54| Once we meet with them and get a chance to look at the books and records,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9834)|
| 2:43:57| generally it takes about 30 days to wrap those up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9837)|
| 2:44:00| The ones that may get finished first would be the real property only agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9840)|
| 2:44:06| And like I say, a lot of those appear to be in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9846)|
| 2:44:09| And we're just right now working with the assessor of properties office to get the format,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9849)|
| 2:44:14| which they would like that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9854)|
| 2:44:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9856)|
| 2:44:17| At the time that you, I guess, conclude your audits, you'll send a copy to the property assessor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9857)|
| 2:44:24| Also, can you CC county commission, city council, Mayor Ragsdale, Mayor Haslam,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9864)|
| 2:44:33| and I guess the IDB boards of both the city and county as well as, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9873)|
| 2:44:38| if there's any that's KCDC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9878)|
| 2:44:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9882)|
| 2:44:43| Because things have a potential of getting where we don't get the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9883)|
| 2:44:47| and something gets worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9887)|
| 2:44:49| And I think when you're talking about public financing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9889)|
| 2:44:52| I think the public has every right to know that if people sign contracts to hire 200 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9892)|
| 2:44:58| in Knox County and they fail to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9898)|
| 2:45:00| I think certainly that we need to hold those people accountable, whoever they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9900)|
| 2:45:05| We can CC whoever the body would like us to CC on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9905)|
| 2:45:09| That's not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9909)|
| 2:45:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9911)|
| 2:45:12| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9912)|
| 2:45:14| No, I was going to ask Commissioner Moore, you're asking that we receive the report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9914)|
| 2:45:17| and approve the report, but I gather from you we don't have a final report to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9917)|
| 2:45:21| Yes, I thought they had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9921)|
| 2:45:23| No, I'm just updating where we're at in the review process today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9923)|
| 2:45:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9926)|
| 2:45:27| So there's really no action for us to take right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9927)|
| 2:45:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9929)|
| 2:45:30| I just want him to make sure he CCs us and it doesn't get lost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9930)|
| 2:45:32| and we're three months down the road before we hear about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9932)|
| 2:45:35| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9935)|
| 2:45:36| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9936)|
| 2:45:37| I got Bush Brothers down here and the Knoxville New Sentinel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9937)|
| 2:45:41| What were the other two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9941)|
| 2:45:44| Exedy American.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9944)|
| 2:45:49| And the last one, the agreement reads Crippen slash Jackson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9949)|
| 2:45:54| and then in parentheses it says J. Swiss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9954)|
| 2:46:00| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9960)|
| 2:46:01| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9961)|
| 2:46:05| If one of these organizations is not in compliance with their pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9965)|
| 2:46:10| are there automatic consequences to that or would this body have to take action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9970)|
| 2:46:18| Reading the agreement, it appears to me that the first course is through the Industrial Development Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9978)|
| 2:46:24| whether it's through the city or the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9984)|
| 2:46:26| They're the first ones that kind of make a decision whether to revoke that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9986)|
| 2:46:30| In basic reading beyond that, I'm not sure, but reading the agreement, that's what it appears to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9990)|
| 2:46:37| One of my primary concerns with this is if the Knoxville New Sentinel, for some reason, is not in compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=9997)|
| 2:46:47| those of us who sit in elected positions and those who sit in appointed positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10007)|
| 2:46:55| are folks that don't want to make their only local paper mad at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10015)|
| 2:47:03| And so what I would be afraid of is that if they are not in compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10023)|
| 2:47:07| that there may be a hesitance to take any action to bring them into compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10027)|
| 2:47:15| because of fear of bad publicity or bad press.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10035)|
| 2:47:19| And I'm sure I'm probably going to get some more of that for even mentioning this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10039)|
| 2:47:24| But is there any way, Mr. Law Director, is there any way we can set something up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10044)|
| 2:47:32| where if a person is not in compliance with a pilot, that there's some automatic consequences to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10052)|
| 2:47:40| so that a political body, be it elected or appointed, is required to take action against our only newspaper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10060)|
| 2:47:51| our only daily newspaper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10071)|
| 2:47:53| Is there any way that we can have it fixed up to where if they're not in compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10073)|
| 2:47:57| there's some automatic consequences or is it going to have to come before an elected body or an appointed body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10077)|
| 2:48:08| I hate to answer a question in a vacuum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10088)|
| 2:48:11| I've not read that agreement that you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10091)|
| 2:48:20| Can this body structure another agreement of some sort in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10100)|
| 2:48:26| Most likely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10106)|
| 2:48:29| We would have to take a look at it to see, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10109)|
| 2:48:31| I can't just give you an answer about that one right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10111)|
| 2:48:34| But you do have to have an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10114)|
| 2:48:36| You're at least going through that step for there to be a finding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10116)|
| 2:48:42| You have to know what you're dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10122)|
| 2:48:44| There are requirements within that document that have to be met and have to continue to be met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10124)|
| 2:48:53| And the consequences of those, we'd have to leave for another day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10133)|
| 2:48:59| I would have to look at that and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10139)|
| 2:49:01| I mean, I wasn't on this body when that pilot was passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10141)|
| 2:49:04| but I certainly think that in the future when we do something like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10144)|
| 2:49:09| especially when it's with an entity like our only daily newspaper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10149)|
| 2:49:14| that we have some automatic consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10154)|
| 2:49:17| Because I'll tell you, with a daily newspaper, they make endorsements in political campaigns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10157)|
| 2:49:23| They cover politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10163)|
| 2:49:27| You know, I think that there's a real conflict of interest there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10167)|
| 2:49:33| that either an elected person like myself or an appointed person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10173)|
| 2:49:37| like some member of the Industrial Development Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10177)|
| 2:49:40| would be extremely hesitant to take any action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10180)|
| 2:49:44| So I think that in the future when we set up pilots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10184)|
| 2:49:48| that we need to have some automatic consequences that comes in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10188)|
| 2:49:52| because there's really no accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10192)|
| 2:49:55| If these folks are not in compliance, it is highly unlikely that anything will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10195)|
| 2:50:03| And I think that in the future we need to take that into consideration when we do these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10203)|
| 2:50:09| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10209)|
| 2:50:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10211)|
| 2:50:12| I hope certainly everyone doesn't feel like Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10212)|
| 2:50:15| Hopefully we can do our jobs no matter if it's ABC Corporation or the Knoxville New Sentinel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10215)|
| 2:50:22| I think if people come and ask for public financing, I take the New Sentinel as an example, $55 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10222)|
| 2:50:29| Certainly they've agreed to a contract, and hopefully they'll follow that contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10229)|
| 2:50:33| And if they're not in compliance, we need to make sure that they get into compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10233)|
| 2:50:37| And hopefully the people on the IDB boards that we put there and put public trust in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10237)|
| 2:50:45| that they do what their heart tells them to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10245)|
| 2:50:49| Scott, I would hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10249)|
| 2:50:51| But one thing that really has me concerned, and I wasn't on this body then, so I have no proof,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10251)|
| 2:50:56| but the rumor is that when this pilot was passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10256)|
| 2:51:00| that the New Sentinel encouraged commissioners to lobby each other to pass this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10260)|
| 2:51:07| And then that lobbying outside of meetings was the very thing that they sued us for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10267)|
| 2:51:14| for violation of the Sunshine Law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10274)|
| 2:51:16| So, I mean, it just seems, you know, I just think we need to have some consequences set up in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10276)|
| 2:51:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10282)|
| 2:51:23| Thank you, Mr. Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10283)|
| 2:51:24| One last question, and then I'll let you get back to Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10284)|
| 2:51:28| In reviewing the contracts, have you seen, I guess, conflicting exhibits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10288)|
| 2:51:36| or what should have been agreed to in a public meeting, I guess, the IDB board, and what is actually in the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10296)|
| 2:51:44| Having not been at the actual negotiation of the agreement, I can't really answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10304)|
| 2:51:49| I mean, there are exhibits to some of the agreements that are not covered in the agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10309)|
| 2:51:57| but they're exhibits after the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10317)|
| 2:51:59| So having not been there when they discussed it, I really can't answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10319)|
| 2:52:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10323)|
| 2:52:04| Are the contracts written specific on jobs and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10324)|
| 2:52:10| or are they kind of laid open where we could drive a truck through them if we need to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10330)|
| 2:52:14| Well, some of them do specifically state in their employment, the number of employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10334)|
| 2:52:19| Some of them are written a little bit looser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10339)|
| 2:52:22| But there are some agreements that specifically state a number of employees total| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10342)|
| 2:52:27| and a number of local employees, that type of a thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10347)|
| 2:52:30| But others of them are very loose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10350)|
| 2:52:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10352)|
| 2:52:33| And that's all the questions I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10353)|
| 2:52:34| Thank you, Dale, for coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10354)|
| 2:52:36| We have one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10356)|
| 2:52:37| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10357)|
| 2:52:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10358)|
| 2:52:39| This is for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10359)|
| 2:52:40| John, if we have an agreement like this and it's a contract and they've broken it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10360)|
| 2:52:47| then they should be liable for what taxes we should do without giving them a tax break, shouldn't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10367)|
| 2:52:52| We would have to see what the agreement says, the language, the specific language of the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10372)|
| 2:52:56| You're going through the right step, the right process right now through the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10376)|
| 2:53:03| And once that's done, there needs to be a judgment made about the findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10383)|
| 2:53:07| And if there is a breach of the agreement, then there needs to be a decision made on how to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10387)|
| 2:53:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10395)|
| 2:53:16| And I would like to clear one other thing here with Mr. Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10396)|
| 2:53:20| I don't believe this went through the IDB board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10400)|
| 2:53:22| I believe this went through KCDC, didn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10402)|
| 2:53:27| Are you talking about the deal with the new setting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10407)|
| 2:53:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10409)|
| 2:53:30| IDB, city's IDB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10410)|
| 2:53:32| Commissioner Roundtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10412)|
| 2:53:36| Todd, did you want to delve in on this too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10416)|
| 2:53:44| I'm Todd Napier with the Development Corporation of Knox County, 17 Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10424)|
| 2:53:49| We also serve as staff to the Industrial Development Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10429)|
| 2:53:54| And I haven't seen what they've looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10434)|
| 2:53:57| I know that we provide them the information that they had requested related to pilots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10437)|
| 2:54:01| So I can't speak specifically to any of the items that were brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10441)|
| 2:54:06| but the Industrial Development Board does review the actual accomplishments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10446)|
| 2:54:14| as they're laid out in the development agreements when they put forward a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10454)|
| 2:54:20| So they are looking at that and reviewing that on an annual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10460)|
| 2:54:25| And I can assure you that it's in their interest as well that these companies perform,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10465)|
| 2:54:30| and that's their expectation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10470)|
| 2:54:32| Like I said, I don't want to speak to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10472)|
| 2:54:34| and can't speak to the specifics of what we're looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10474)|
| 2:54:36| but, you know, any information that we can provide that sounds like some of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10476)|
| 2:54:41| that they don't feel like they have enough information of what I heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10481)|
| 2:54:46| I just wanted you to assure you it's not just a rampant program that's going on out there without being looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10486)|
| 2:54:56| You finished, Commissioner Roundtree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10496)|
| 2:54:59| Thank you, Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10499)|
| 2:55:00| Todd, before you sit down, you're saying that you serve as staff for IDB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10500)|
| 2:55:06| Are you saying you review these on an annual basis and you believe they're in compliance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10506)|
| 2:55:12| I am saying I'm going to have to look at what he's got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10512)|
| 2:55:14| I'm saying what I said was that we look at them on an annual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10514)|
| 2:55:18| It's the county IDB on those pilots, and we have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10518)|
| 2:55:22| They're reviewed by an audit firm called Pew and Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10522)|
| 2:55:26| So you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10526)|
| 2:55:27| And there's a compliance review committee that looks at those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10527)|
| 2:55:30| So if we came back here in a month or two months from now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10530)|
| 2:55:33| and we see that the people have failed to file their proper paperwork for four or five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10533)|
| 2:55:38| you're saying that you have someone auditing that annually?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10538)|
| 2:55:43| No, I'm not saying, you know, to the specific requirements of whether they filed a form with the state or with whoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10543)|
| 2:55:51| I can tell you that we're getting the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10551)|
| 2:55:53| There's usually they're set up differently, but a typical one might say we're going to create, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10553)|
| 2:55:59| we're going to invest so many dollars in capital investment and create so many jobs and such a payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10559)|
| 2:56:05| Those are the measurements that are specifically related to economic development that we go out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10565)|
| 2:56:10| And they're not all set up that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10570)|
| 2:56:12| It depends on, they're unique, but generally they have those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10572)|
| 2:56:15| And that's what we look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10575)|
| 2:56:18| I can't speak to whether or not there was a specific form that the company was supposed to send to the state or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10578)|
| 2:56:24| I'm not exactly sure what he's speaking to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10584)|
| 2:56:27| Probably sent to the county and probably to the IDB board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10587)|
| 2:56:29| I think you all require that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10589)|
| 2:56:31| Because it has to be based off if they have leased equipment, that can't be part of the pilot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10591)|
| 2:56:37| because the property they have, personal property, would have to be signed over to the IDB board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10597)|
| 2:56:43| The IDB board would have to own it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10603)|
| 2:56:45| So you all should have the records of what you own as far as personal property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10605)|
| 2:56:50| Now, either someone's brought that to your attention in the past or if no one has and it's found in an audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10610)|
| 2:56:58| then I question probably your audit firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10618)|
| 2:57:03| I'm not sure I follow what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10623)|
| 2:57:10| If the IDB board gives someone a TIF and they're going to do so much infrastructure, I mean, personal property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10630)|
| 2:57:18| well, some of it could be for the land and some of it could be for equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10638)|
| 2:57:23| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10643)|
| 2:57:24| Real and personal property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10644)|
| 2:57:26| For it to be under a pilot, technically it has to be deeded over to the industrial development board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10646)|
| 2:57:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10652)|
| 2:57:33| So it can't be leased equipment or anything because you couldn't deed over leased equipment to the IDB board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10653)|
| 2:57:38| because the company wouldn't own it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10658)|
| 2:57:40| So either you all have received the proper paperwork and you would know it because if there was a problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10660)|
| 2:57:46| your audit firm probably would have told you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10666)|
| 2:57:51| Without specifically having a chance to sit down with him and look at what he needs, I can't answer your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10671)|
| 2:57:58| Yeah, but I thought you just told us you reviewed them annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10678)|
| 2:58:02| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10682)|
| 2:58:03| We get reports back from the company on what are your investments, what are your number of jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10683)|
| 2:58:09| and they are attested to by the company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10689)|
| 2:58:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10691)|
| 2:58:12| Have you ever heard of Swiss Tech?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10692)|
| 2:58:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10693)|
| 2:58:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10694)|
| 2:58:15| Do you believe they're in compliance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10695)|
| 2:58:17| Their pilot expired last year and the compliance review committee looked at that a couple months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10697)|
| 2:58:29| and determined that they were satisfied that the company had met the intent of their particular development agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10709)|
| 2:58:37| Who looked at it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10717)|
| 2:58:39| The compliance committee for the industrial development board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10719)|
| 2:58:43| Okay, because one of your IDB board members have said that they were only about 60%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10723)|
| 2:58:48| and I guess something was going to be brought up about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10728)|
| 2:58:52| There was and there was some circumstances, which I can't speak to right now because I don't have that in front of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10732)|
| 2:58:58| about that, but it was determined that they did what they said they were going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10738)|
| 2:59:04| That's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10744)|
| 2:59:07| Thank you, Todd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10747)|
| 2:59:08| We're going to move on to 914 on page 27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10748)|
| 2:59:20| That is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10760)|
| 2:59:48| 914 is to require two public hearings for politicians, landowners, developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10788)|
| 2:59:55| and the public to understand the transfer of development rights before they are to be implemented, adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10795)|
| 3:00:01| accepted, or furthermore used in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10801)|
| 3:00:04| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10804)|
| 3:00:06| Voted 9-0, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10806)|
| 3:00:08| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10808)|
| 3:00:09| N-0, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10809)|
| 3:00:12| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10812)|
| 3:00:16| Do we really need to vote on this where no one is even considering it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10816)|
| 3:00:20| I think the Hilltop Preservation Committee is considering implementing transfer of development rights in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10820)|
| 3:00:29| but, you know, this is not a practice that's being considered right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10829)|
| 3:00:34| so should we even be talking about this at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10834)|
| 3:00:38| Commissioner DeFries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10838)|
| 3:00:39| Chairman, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10839)|
| 3:00:40| I needed to amend the language of that 914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10840)|
| 3:00:44| Instead of saying transfer of development rights, we need to correct that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10844)|
| 3:00:48| and say it is two separate zoning districts combined into one PR district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10848)|
| 3:01:03| Isn't that an MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10863)|
| 3:01:05| I mean, that's a fairly common practice that MPC does quite often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10865)|
| 3:01:13| Commissioner Lambert, in all due respect, you can call this whatever the MPC wants to call this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10873)|
| 3:01:20| but there are contracts right now surrounding the Wells Creek development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10880)|
| 3:01:26| with individuals who are going to relinquish their development rights on their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10886)|
| 3:01:32| Now, MPC does not want to call it transfer of development rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10892)|
| 3:01:36| and the language that I just now read into the record is the language that they're using,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10896)|
| 3:01:41| but, in effect, you can call it anything you want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10901)|
| 3:01:43| but, yes, it is getting ready to be used in South Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10903)|
| 3:01:48| Commissioner DeFries, could you repeat what you just said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10908)|
| 3:01:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10912)|
| 3:01:54| It is an attempt to combine two separate zoning districts into one PR district of one to five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10914)|
| 3:02:09| Did you have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10929)|
| 3:02:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10931)|
| 3:02:12| And to require two additional public hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10932)|
| 3:02:19| Buzz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10939)|
| 3:02:20| Hold on a second, Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10940)|
| 3:02:22| Were you finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10942)|
| 3:02:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10944)|
| 3:02:26| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10946)|
| 3:02:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10947)|
| 3:02:28| Buzz is, where is he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10948)|
| 3:02:31| I know he's out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10951)|
| 3:02:32| Oh, there he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10952)|
| 3:02:34| Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10954)|
| 3:02:35| Well, Mark can probably answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10955)|
| 3:02:36| Is this a common practice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10956)|
| 3:02:38| Isn't this a normal thing to combine two residential communities into a larger community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10958)|
| 3:02:48| The common practice historically has been to allow that to happen without a rezoning to make that line disappear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10968)|
| 3:02:56| and we would handle it with the approval of the development plan, which is the second step of any zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10976)|
| 3:03:02| We've gone the extra step here to literally take zone A and zone B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10982)|
| 3:03:08| and reconfigure them as a new zone district so that everybody would be put on notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10988)|
| 3:03:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10993)|
| 3:03:14| I have a question, though, Mr. Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10994)|
| 3:03:16| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10996)|
| 3:03:17| I have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10997)|
| 3:03:18| And that is a common practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=10998)|
| 3:03:20| That's something that's been done before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11000)|
| 3:03:22| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11002)|
| 3:03:24| Quite often a developer will contract with a parcel of land, obtain his zoning as PR 1 to 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11004)|
| 3:03:34| and then subsequently contract with an adjacent property owner, get that rezoned PR 1 to 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11014)|
| 3:03:41| and we treat that as a common boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11021)|
| 3:03:45| Because this particular area had multiple property owners in that second district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11025)|
| 3:03:53| we made the applicant submit a rezoning so that everybody would be on notice as to what was happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11033)|
| 3:04:01| And if I understand this right, this is to aid in clustering so that a person can cluster a development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11041)|
| 3:04:10| which is a much more modern way to develop, where you cluster your houses together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11050)|
| 3:04:15| and it actually helps preserve green space in a lot of circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11055)|
| 3:04:23| You know, this is a common practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11063)|
| 3:04:25| Now, I know there are folks on this body who are calling this transfer of development rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11065)|
| 3:04:32| and there are pros and cons of transfer of development rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11072)|
| 3:04:37| That involves properties that are not adjacent to one another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11077)|
| 3:04:40| and it's something that may be a very positive thing that may come out of the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11080)|
| 3:04:45| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11085)|
| 3:04:46| I have a motion on the floor, and I need a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11086)|
| 3:04:49| If there is one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11089)|
| 3:04:51| I will second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11091)|
| 3:04:53| Go ahead, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11093)|
| 3:04:55| But, I mean, I just don't see why we, if this is a common practice, it's something that's done every month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11095)|
| 3:05:03| and it looks like now, because there's one close to a certain commissioner's house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11103)|
| 3:05:08| that they want to completely change the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11108)|
| 3:05:11| We are up here to uphold the process, not change the process to suit our needs whenever we don't like something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11111)|
| 3:05:19| that is in compliance with the process that is prescribed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11119)|
| 3:05:24| I know folks, you know, they always want their subdivision to be the last one built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11124)|
| 3:05:31| but that's not the way the world works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11131)|
| 3:05:34| And I think that in this situation that, you know, MPC has a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11134)|
| 3:05:39| They're going through that process, and I think this is an attempt to muddy the waters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11139)|
| 3:05:45| and change public policy over one rezoning, and this is a situation that is fairly common.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11145)|
| 3:05:54| We approve this sort of thing every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11154)|
| 3:05:56| MPC approves these sort of things, and I think this is a ridiculous attempt to change the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11156)|
| 3:06:02| because somebody didn't like the outcome, and that's why I'm voting against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11162)|
| 3:06:06| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11166)|
| 3:06:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11169)|
| 3:06:11| Indeed, transfer of development rights is an issue that has been discussed on this steep slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11171)|
| 3:06:20| Ridgeline Development Task Force, and it's something that will be a tool possibly in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11180)|
| 3:06:26| It will be way down the road, and we're just now beginning to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11186)|
| 3:06:32| And it's very complex, and it's something that needs multiple, much more than two public hearings, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11192)|
| 3:06:40| And I agree with Mr. Fries about, in principle, about I think what is taking place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11200)|
| 3:06:48| in South Knoxville at Wells Creek is there is an effort to possibly circumvent some of the previous directions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11208)|
| 3:06:58| from the sector plan and the efforts of the community to prevent an unwanted development by people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11218)|
| 3:07:06| and I understand that, and I respect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11226)|
| 3:07:09| Now, as to where we are on the agenda, I don't know what we're doing right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11229)|
| 3:07:18| and so I'm calling for help from the law director or from the chair as to where we're going right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11238)|
| 3:07:31| There's been a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11251)|
| 3:07:33| Right now we're in the middle of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11253)|
| 3:07:38| The motion is, as Mr. Fries stated, the revised version of this resolution, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11258)|
| 3:07:49| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11269)|
| 3:07:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11270)|
| 3:07:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11271)|
| 3:07:54| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11274)|
| 3:08:00| Mark, I have a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11280)|
| 3:08:04| I can't hardly agree with Mr. Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11284)|
| 3:08:07| We go through this every month, like you were talking about, and you bring this property in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11287)|
| 3:08:13| But you correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11293)|
| 3:08:14| In everything I've ever voted in up here where you can buy this property, the developer is buying it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11294)|
| 3:08:20| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11300)|
| 3:08:25| The property adjacent to what he has, he's made an offer in a contract to buy this other property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11305)|
| 3:08:32| What we're doing here is something entirely different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11312)|
| 3:08:36| The developer is not buying this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11316)|
| 3:08:39| He is just buying the development rights to where he can get more units on his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11319)|
| 3:08:46| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11326)|
| 3:08:48| Quite often in planned residential districts, particularly if they're a fairly sizable tract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11328)|
| 3:08:54| the original owner of the parcel will retain a homestead or a lot within the new subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11334)|
| 3:09:03| and so that remains in the ownership of the original owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11343)|
| 3:09:09| Just the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11349)|
| 3:09:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11350)|
| 3:09:11| Just that lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11351)|
| 3:09:12| But if he's got 50 acres out here and he retains one acre and a house, he sells the other 49.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11352)|
| 3:09:19| What we're talking about is they're retaining their house and their property, all of their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11359)|
| 3:09:26| We don't know that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11366)|
| 3:09:28| Well, when you're buying development rights, that's what he's doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11368)|
| 3:09:30| He's not buying the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11370)|
| 3:09:31| Am I not correct on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11371)|
| 3:09:32| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11372)|
| 3:09:34| Well, why would you buy development rights if you're buying the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11374)|
| 3:09:38| He is combining two zoning districts into a single zoning district with a larger area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11378)|
| 3:09:44| Well, let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11384)|
| 3:09:45| He's combining that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11385)|
| 3:09:47| Is he going to have a deed to that property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11387)|
| 3:09:49| Ultimately, he will have deeds to a lot of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11389)|
| 3:09:52| but I don't know the final configuration of the original owner's lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11392)|
| 3:09:56| Well, if he does not have a deed to that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11396)|
| 3:09:59| does he have the right to build more houses on his property or whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11399)|
| 3:10:05| If he doesn't have a deed to the other property just because he's bought development rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11405)|
| 3:10:09| Mr. Jarnan can explain this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11409)|
| 3:10:10| I'm not saying that I'm against this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11410)|
| 3:10:13| but what I'm saying is I feel like you and Commissioner Lambert are misleading the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11413)|
| 3:10:18| when you said this has been done regularly up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11418)|
| 3:10:22| This has been done regularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11422)|
| 3:10:24| The typical scenario is a single property owner rather than multiple property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11424)|
| 3:10:29| You have had people, developers, come before you then, and we voted on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11429)|
| 3:10:34| Here's what you're saying, where they bought development rights and not the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11434)|
| 3:10:38| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11438)|
| 3:10:39| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11439)|
| 3:10:40| They buy the entire property and the owner retains a right to a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11440)|
| 3:10:45| To a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11445)|
| 3:10:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11446)|
| 3:10:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11447)|
| 3:10:48| The balance of that density is used elsewhere within that planned residential zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11448)|
| 3:10:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11452)|
| 3:10:53| That's not the way I understand this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11453)|
| 3:10:55| And Mr. Jernigan there is a good friend of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11455)|
| 3:10:57| I'd like for him to step up and explain what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11457)|
| 3:10:59| All I want everything to be is above board up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11459)|
| 3:11:03| And Commissioner Lambert has said we vote on this every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11463)|
| 3:11:07| And I don't ever remember voting on one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11467)|
| 3:11:10| I can remember voting on them when they bought the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11470)|
| 3:11:13| We do that every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11473)|
| 3:11:14| The county commission does not ever see the development plan because that's an approval by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11474)|
| 3:11:19| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11479)|
| 3:11:20| And the concept plan, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11480)|
| 3:11:22| The concept plan that the county commission sees is the establishment of the PR zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11482)|
| 3:11:28| We approve zonings every month that involve two parcels together that have been put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11488)|
| 3:11:33| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11493)|
| 3:11:37| Go ahead, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11497)|
| 3:11:38| Victor, I still have the floor, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11498)|
| 3:11:40| Yes, I said go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11500)|
| 3:11:41| Victor, all I want you to do is explain this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11501)|
| 3:11:48| I'm happy to explain how we got to where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11508)|
| 3:11:51| Name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11511)|
| 3:11:52| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11512)|
| 3:11:53| My name is Victor Jernigan, 108 Stacoya Lane, Suite 103, Knoxville 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11513)|
| 3:12:00| And how we got to where we are with this particular situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11520)|
| 3:12:04| which is going to be up at the September county commission meeting because it was just approved at the NPC meeting in August to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11524)|
| 3:12:14| So it will be at the September county commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11534)|
| 3:12:20| And there is a plan right now to attend the South Dwell Homeowners Association meeting on September the 2nd to further continue the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11540)|
| 3:12:28| This is not an effort to circumvent anything that has been put on before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11548)|
| 3:12:34| but rather a direct result of exactly what has been asked for in the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11554)|
| 3:12:40| using the guidelines which are currently established by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11560)|
| 3:12:46| We're not trying to do anything that is other than develop the property as low-density residential property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11566)|
| 3:12:54| in the area where Wells Creek is located on John Sevier Highway about a mile south of the intersection with Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11574)|
| 3:13:01| This property was originally approximately 22 acres in size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11581)|
| 3:13:09| and was approved by NPC twice for medium-density residential to allow construction of approximately 235 market-rate apartments on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11589)|
| 3:13:21| We come to the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11601)|
| 3:13:25| There were nine members on the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11605)|
| 3:13:27| Even though we had had overwhelming staff recommendation because of the need to modify the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11607)|
| 3:13:32| and overwhelming NPC commission support twice, we lost the county commission when there were nine members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11612)|
| 3:13:40| The neighborhood continually said that they wanted the area developed under low-density residential guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11620)|
| 3:13:46| And one of the other issues was that the apartments would have been three-story apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11626)|
| 3:13:51| and the neighborhood said they didn't want three-story apartments along John Sevier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11631)|
| 3:13:55| We go back, look at the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11635)|
| 3:13:57| We listen to what the neighborhood had said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11637)|
| 3:13:59| We evaluated the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11639)|
| 3:14:02| We talked to the neighbors of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11642)|
| 3:14:04| I know that may be a unique concept, but we talked to the neighbors of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11644)|
| 3:14:08| We explained the situation to them to decide for them to help us work through a process that we rezoned their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11648)|
| 3:14:20| exactly the agreements, by the way, which were previously in place when we were building the apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11660)|
| 3:14:26| the same restrictions that we were moving forward with when we were rezoning for the apartments we were working with the neighbors on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11666)|
| 3:14:32| except now we were going to file a new plat for a combined area of approximately 28, 29 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11672)|
| 3:14:43| that winds up giving us the opportunity to cluster the planned residential zoning district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11683)|
| 3:14:52| and cluster the density on property that I currently own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11692)|
| 3:14:57| The other people who live there and who are the adjoining property owners have had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11697)|
| 3:15:02| and do not have a desire to create additional development coming out on Tipton Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11702)|
| 3:15:11| They are more than happy to let their property be zoned, enter into a new overall subdivision plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11711)|
| 3:15:18| which will be filed as part of the subdivision plan, which they will have to sign as part of the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11718)|
| 3:15:24| The neighbors agreeing to enter into this overall planning zone district is exactly what is permitted in MPC guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11724)|
| 3:15:38| We are doing exactly what the South Dwell Homeowners Association asked us to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11738)|
| 3:15:44| develop the property under a planned residential zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11744)|
| 3:15:47| We have gone so far as to show the type of home that we would build, the kind of condominiums that would be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11747)|
| 3:15:54| We've had discussions about the size ranges of the condominiums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11754)|
| 3:15:57| all the things that are way far down the road from where we are on a rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11757)|
| 3:16:02| But we have been happy to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11762)|
| 3:16:04| We're happy to continue to do it and happy to continue to have the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11764)|
| 3:16:08| The issue about the transfer of development rights or the issue about the ownership rights of how that's done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11768)|
| 3:16:17| we are working under a planned zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11777)|
| 3:16:20| The neighbors are agreeing to implement deed restrictions on their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11780)|
| 3:16:25| I am paying them for the deed restrictions, if you want to look at it that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11785)|
| 3:16:29| so that all they're going to maintain on their property is one home per acre on the developed property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11789)|
| 3:16:35| or the house that they currently have on the lot, as that may be the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11795)|
| 3:16:39| So it is exactly what South Dwell has asked for, the restrictions that they've asked for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11799)|
| 3:16:43| and the method in which they've asked for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11803)|
| 3:16:45| We are just doing it within the guidelines that are permitted today by Knox County and the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11805)|
| 3:16:53| Thank you, Victor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11813)|
| 3:16:54| Victor, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11814)|
| 3:16:56| You made that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11816)|
| 3:16:57| And I really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11817)|
| 3:16:58| There's one other thing I want to ask you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11818)|
| 3:17:00| This really is not a bad deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11820)|
| 3:17:03| It's what people think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11823)|
| 3:17:04| We're protecting some green space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11824)|
| 3:17:07| The only difference is we're not building on this property they own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11827)|
| 3:17:10| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11830)|
| 3:17:11| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11831)|
| 3:17:12| The project actually creates substantially more green space and protected area than any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11832)|
| 3:17:20| if you tried to put 144 rooftops, for example, on the same piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11840)|
| 3:17:25| But what I'm saying is if they developed theirs with the same plan you had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11845)|
| 3:17:30| they would still have the same number of houses that you're going to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11850)|
| 3:17:32| except they're going to be clustered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11852)|
| 3:17:33| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11853)|
| 3:17:34| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11854)|
| 3:17:35| The plan, they're low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11855)|
| 3:17:38| We're low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11858)|
| 3:17:40| If they were to develop the property, if they were to sell the property in the future under a low-density plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11860)|
| 3:17:45| they could redevelop it for multiple housing units, and this will forever restrict those rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11865)|
| 3:17:50| But could we, Mark, step up just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11870)|
| 3:17:56| Would there be any way that we could put a recording fee in to where that is like an easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11876)|
| 3:18:03| where they have to go down and put that in their deed when you get an easement from someone to record that in the deed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11883)|
| 3:18:09| where it cannot, we can't have, this is what the people are concerned about over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11889)|
| 3:18:13| They're concerned about if I sell Victor my development rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11893)|
| 3:18:18| then I sell my property ten years down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11898)|
| 3:18:22| that whoever buys it is going to say, hey, I want to build houses on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11902)|
| 3:18:26| So could we not put some kind of record this in the deed to where people would know what it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11906)|
| 3:18:33| They could voluntarily do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11913)|
| 3:18:34| I don't have the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11914)|
| 3:18:36| The plan doesn't have the authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11916)|
| 3:18:37| Let me ask the law director, do we as a commission have the authority to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11917)|
| 3:18:42| I can answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11922)|
| 3:18:44| We've already publicly stated numerous times that we're going to record deed restrictions on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11924)|
| 3:18:50| which basically outline exactly what I've just described.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11930)|
| 3:18:53| We're recording a new survey for each of the properties involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11933)|
| 3:18:55| None of those are, and where that, where this transfer of development rights issue came up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11935)|
| 3:19:00| these are restrictions that we have volunteered to do that are not required in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11940)|
| 3:19:04| because all that's required in Knox County is that the individual property owners of the new subdivision plat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11944)|
| 3:19:09| which is what this would be, sign the plat individually to record their assent to the recording of the new document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11949)|
| 3:19:17| But we have already agreed that the property owners, we're going to record new deed restrictions for the property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11957)|
| 3:19:22| We're going to record a new survey for the properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11962)|
| 3:19:24| which will also reflect the deed restrictions that are on the property as no more building units allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11964)|
| 3:19:30| So there will be a recording of the new survey, a recording of the deed restrictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11970)|
| 3:19:33| and a recording of the overall survey plat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11973)|
| 3:19:35| We've agreed to pay all those expenses for all the property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11975)|
| 3:19:38| We've paid now five zoning fees at several thousand dollars apiece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11978)|
| 3:19:43| We've engaged in over $100,000 in architectural and engineering work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11983)|
| 3:19:47| to try to move this project forward within the guidelines of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11987)|
| 3:19:51| And we are trying to work this thing to move it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11991)|
| 3:19:54| Okay. I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11994)|
| 3:19:56| Another thing I want to ask here, in reading what Ms. DeFreeze has here, she's not saying she's against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=11996)|
| 3:20:03| She's just saying that we should have two hearings on it to where people understand this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12003)|
| 3:20:09| I mean, I don't believe you're even against that, Victor. Am I wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12009)|
| 3:20:14| We've bought this property more than a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12014)|
| 3:20:18| We've spent several thousand dollars every month maintaining our stormwater controls that are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12018)|
| 3:20:24| We didn't file suit in January or March, whatever Fantzler's decision was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12024)|
| 3:20:32| to try to reverse the zoning when we were awarded the medium density rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12032)|
| 3:20:36| and Fantzler comes out with a different ruling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12036)|
| 3:20:38| We need to get this project on the September meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12038)|
| 3:20:41| We're meeting with the homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12041)|
| 3:20:42| We go to the extra trouble, as Mr. Donaldson has pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12042)|
| 3:20:46| to refile again for another rezoning request to combine the districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12046)|
| 3:20:52| We've had as many public hearings as I think we can have on this, in all sincerity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12052)|
| 3:20:56| and I really need to get this on the September MPC Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12056)|
| 3:21:00| I realize that. I realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12060)|
| 3:21:02| But you've already had what you might call public hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12062)|
| 3:21:05| But what I think what Mr. Freeze is trying to do is make it mandatory to have public hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12065)|
| 3:21:11| And you've already had yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12071)|
| 3:21:13| You've been twice out here, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12073)|
| 3:21:15| And I don't know that the people are against you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12075)|
| 3:21:19| I can't say they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12079)|
| 3:21:20| I think that what they're against and scared of is afraid that these people that you're buying these development rights from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12080)|
| 3:21:28| are later on down the road going to try to build more houses there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12088)|
| 3:21:32| and then that's going to up the ante more than five per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12092)|
| 3:21:35| I think that's what the people are scared of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12095)|
| 3:21:38| They want some kind of safeguard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12098)|
| 3:21:40| And you're talking about the deed restrictions will take care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12100)|
| 3:21:44| New surveys and a subdivision plat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12104)|
| 3:21:50| All the deed restrictions and the new surveys are not required under Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12110)|
| 3:21:55| We're doing that just because we do recognize this is a contested issue in a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12115)|
| 3:22:01| So we are trying to provide all of the assurances that are legally possible anywhere in the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12121)|
| 3:22:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12130)|
| 3:22:12| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12132)|
| 3:22:14| Mr. Chairman, could I get a clarification of the motion that's on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12134)|
| 3:22:19| Are you asking myself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12139)|
| 3:22:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12140)|
| 3:22:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12141)|
| 3:22:22| This is a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12142)|
| 3:22:25| to require two additional public hearings for politicians, landowners, developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12145)|
| 3:22:29| and the public to understand the attempt to combine two separate zoning districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12149)|
| 3:22:39| into one PR district of one to five where they're clustering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12159)|
| 3:22:45| And this has not been done in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12165)|
| 3:22:47| And, Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12167)|
| 3:22:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12171)|
| 3:22:52| After Commissioner Hammond finishes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12172)|
| 3:22:55| You're next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12175)|
| 3:22:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12176)|
| 3:22:57| And I will further explain why this needs to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12177)|
| 3:23:00| I don't have any problem with public hearings, but is this just for one piece of property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12180)|
| 3:23:05| I mean, we've spent a lot of time hearing the merits of this zoning in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12185)|
| 3:23:10| Mark Donaldson, have you had public hearings on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12190)|
| 3:23:13| Are you having more public hearings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12193)|
| 3:23:15| Is this related to just one piece of property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12195)|
| 3:23:18| Are you looking at a broad, I guess, plan or policy for the future as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12198)|
| 3:23:24| I'm just trying to, in my mind, figure out where we're going here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12204)|
| 3:23:28| This is a rezoning case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12208)|
| 3:23:31| We conducted a public hearing at the MPC meeting before they made a recommendation on the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12211)|
| 3:23:36| You will have a public hearing at your September meeting before you act on the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12216)|
| 3:23:42| In addition, I spoke to the South Doyle Homeowners Association last month about this type of action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12222)|
| 3:23:52| Victor was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12232)|
| 3:23:56| If this has ramifications for all of Knox County, it sounds like it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12236)|
| 3:24:00| I would like to see these public hearings extended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12240)|
| 3:24:04| And as we know, yes, we'll have a public hearing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12244)|
| 3:24:07| The opportunity, though, for people to drive down here and be part of a public hearing is probably slim to none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12247)|
| 3:24:12| But I'd like to see you go before the Council of West Knox Homeowners, for example, that have a regularly scheduled meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12252)|
| 3:24:18| and to meet with them and to have a public hearing on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12258)|
| 3:24:22| Because if we're going to have a policy that's going to affect all of Knox County, then I don't understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12262)|
| 3:24:28| And I think that our people need to understand exactly the ramifications of what we're talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12268)|
| 3:24:34| So I'm going to be in agreement that we need to have public hearings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12274)|
| 3:24:38| and suggest that we have these additional hearings that are conducive to where people are already meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12278)|
| 3:24:45| so that they can come at a regularly scheduled meeting to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12285)|
| 3:24:48| But I guess my hesitancy is if it were just for one piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12288)|
| 3:24:52| but it looks like it's going to be a broad policy that we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12292)|
| 3:24:56| Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12296)|
| 3:24:58| It's a practice that's common currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12298)|
| 3:25:01| Not in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12301)|
| 3:25:04| Pardon me, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12304)|
| 3:25:05| We literally do this every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12305)|
| 3:25:09| The change is that we've required Mr. Jernigan to file another rezoning application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12309)|
| 3:25:16| and go through another set of public hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12316)|
| 3:25:22| Chairman, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12322)|
| 3:25:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12323)|
| 3:25:24| I would like to grant the floor to Scott Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12324)|
| 3:25:31| Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12331)|
| 3:25:35| And I think what he shares, well, this is setting a precedent for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12335)|
| 3:25:40| and for development in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12340)|
| 3:25:42| So it's not exclusive to the 9th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12342)|
| 3:25:45| And I think what Scott's going to share with you, I think it will open your eyes as to why I think public hearings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12345)|
| 3:25:50| are necessary before we implement this new reconfiguration to cluster development on one property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12350)|
| 3:25:59| when he doesn't own all the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12359)|
| 3:26:02| Thank you, Commissioner Freese.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12362)|
| 3:26:03| My name is Scott Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12363)|
| 3:26:04| I reside at 7744 Trophy Run Lane, South Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12364)|
| 3:26:09| I'm here today representing the South Dory homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12369)|
| 3:26:11| and other concerned citizens in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12371)|
| 3:26:16| When I originally came prepared to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12376)|
| 3:26:18| I was going to speak to the process more so than agenda item 65 that the MPC passed last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12378)|
| 3:26:25| But we've obviously gone down that path, so I'll have to have a few comments with regard to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12385)|
| 3:26:33| This first item I want to mention is the word common has been thrown around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12393)|
| 3:26:37| This is not a common practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12397)|
| 3:26:38| What they're referring to is subdivisions, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12398)|
| 3:26:41| And Commissioner Pinkston hinted at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12401)|
| 3:26:45| Basically, most of the time, these properties, there may be one individual that owns a farm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12405)|
| 3:26:51| and they've sold off their farm for that subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12411)|
| 3:26:54| But what this is is clearly, and you all have received a letter already from the Homeowner's Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12414)|
| 3:27:00| and if you haven't had a chance to read it, you're going to hear a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12420)|
| 3:27:04| But what's really going on here is this, and I'll back up and present my case, but what's going on here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12424)|
| 3:27:13| this is truly a means of circumventing the current zoning ordinances that we have in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12433)|
| 3:27:22| And the reason I say that is call it what you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12442)|
| 3:27:26| The development rights are being transferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12446)|
| 3:27:31| I don't care how you want to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12451)|
| 3:27:32| He's already said that he's somehow got a contract to take these people's development rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12452)|
| 3:27:39| They may or may not know what they're doing, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12459)|
| 3:27:42| But let me back you up here real quick and tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12462)|
| 3:27:45| First of all, I want to correct Mr. Jernigan in that he did this in an MPC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12465)|
| 3:27:50| He is not giving the Saldori homeowners or the community exactly what we asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12470)|
| 3:27:56| Exactly what we asked for was on his first development of his property was planned residential, five dwelling units or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12476)|
| 3:28:04| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12484)|
| 3:28:05| That gave him approximately, on his 17 acres, approximately 82, 85 dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12485)|
| 3:28:11| I don't remember exactly what it was approved for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12491)|
| 3:28:13| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12493)|
| 3:28:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12495)|
| 3:28:16| He came back and wanted that to change the south sector plan to go to medium density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12496)|
| 3:28:23| and get it up to 12 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12503)|
| 3:28:26| We, as Saldori homeowners, if you recall, came, it was approved at MPC, came here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12506)|
| 3:28:31| You all voted it down, and we appreciate that, and we think you made the correct vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12511)|
| 3:28:36| because it was changing the sector plan just to meet the needs of one individual and one small piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12516)|
| 3:28:43| and it was totally irrelevant to the surrounding properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12523)|
| 3:28:47| Because that happened, he then approached the neighbors, as he said, which had agricultural zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12527)|
| 3:28:54| He made application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12534)|
| 3:28:56| Wells Creek LLC, they did not make application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12536)|
| 3:28:59| He made application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12539)|
| 3:29:01| They didn't even have to sign the application to get it rezoned to PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12541)|
| 3:29:06| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12546)|
| 3:29:07| That got approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12547)|
| 3:29:08| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12548)|
| 3:29:09| He had in his hip pocket, hadn't told anybody about it, but he had in his hip pocket that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12549)|
| 3:29:16| and I don't know what, when, the time, and I'm no lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12556)|
| 3:29:18| I want to make that clear right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12558)|
| 3:29:20| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12560)|
| 3:29:21| I'm no lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12561)|
| 3:29:22| These are my opinions of the process that I think needs to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12562)|
| 3:29:27| He had in his hip pocket these development rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12567)|
| 3:29:31| He then came back to MPC to get those development rights and to combine those properties after he already had it zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12571)|
| 3:29:40| So he had his zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12580)|
| 3:29:41| He had area B zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12581)|
| 3:29:43| Then he combined A and B together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12583)|
| 3:29:45| What he has today, based on MPC's approval that you will be hearing next month, is 145 units now on his 17 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12585)|
| 3:29:56| That is eight and a half dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12596)|
| 3:29:59| That totally circumvents five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12599)|
| 3:30:02| If he owned all the property, he could do what he's doing within the current system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12602)|
| 3:30:09| But the approach they've taken is not the current system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12609)|
| 3:30:13| A couple of what ifs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12613)|
| 3:30:15| And here's the concern where we have, and it's more processed than it is Mr. Jernigan's development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12615)|
| 3:30:23| What if he buys more adjoining property, gets it zoned, he rezones it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12623)|
| 3:30:31| They don't rezone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12631)|
| 3:30:32| He rezones it PR five or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12632)|
| 3:30:35| There's another eight acres available there between him and West Dick Ford Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12635)|
| 3:30:40| He comes to MPC, gets it rezoned, and he combines those three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12640)|
| 3:30:45| Now he's back and he's got his 12 dwelling units per acre on his 17 acres under low density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12645)|
| 3:30:54| I think that shows a flaw, actually, we have in Knox County with regard to our current ordinance on density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12654)|
| 3:31:02| But that's kind of what we're dealing with here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12662)|
| 3:31:06| So I think the process, and even Mr. Donaldson brought it up, Mr. Norman brought it up in that they're looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12666)|
| 3:31:13| It is a great, this transfer of development rights, which is what's occurring here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12673)|
| 3:31:18| But it's occurring without the details that are needed to protect the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12678)|
| 3:31:24| It's typically done for conservation easements for parks, protect wetlands, protect steep slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12684)|
| 3:31:31| That's what this practice is typically done for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12691)|
| 3:31:33| In this case, it is strictly being done to circumvent the current zoning in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12693)|
| 3:31:40| I really truly believe that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12700)|
| 3:31:42| Now, one other point I'd like to make here with regard to another what if.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12702)|
| 3:31:48| And this is where the danger is, and I'm not speaking as a lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12708)|
| 3:31:52| What if?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12712)|
| 3:31:54| He's already said they're going to get the zoning or the easements, okay, or deed restrictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12714)|
| 3:32:01| whatever you want to call them, tied to the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12721)|
| 3:32:04| And the MPC feels like they can control that through zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12724)|
| 3:32:08| What if he goes back to one of these individuals, purchases their property, eliminates the easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12728)|
| 3:32:14| because it's now his property, he eliminates the easement, comes back, proposes to subdivide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12734)|
| 3:32:22| and then comes back to MPC, goes through the zoning process, and next thing you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12742)|
| 3:32:26| he's got another five dwelling units per acre or possibly more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12746)|
| 3:32:31| And that's where the Knox County and the residents are not protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12751)|
| 3:32:35| Now, a lot of that has to do with if he can do it, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12755)|
| 3:32:38| But you're opening a can of worms here, I truly believe, and I support this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12758)|
| 3:32:43| in that we need to educate the people what's going on around them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12763)|
| 3:32:46| because if this goes through, it is not common to do this in this nature, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12766)|
| 3:32:53| And if we go through this process and allow the process to be changed and to set, you know, a precedence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12773)|
| 3:33:02| then every developer in Knox County is going to be out there and they're going to be wheeling and dealing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12782)|
| 3:33:07| We don't have any provision, as was spoken earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12787)|
| 3:33:09| We don't have any provision that prevents a man from getting PR on the west side of town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12789)|
| 3:33:15| and applying it to the south side of town or splitting it up and taking some to the north side of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12795)|
| 3:33:21| You know, you could do a case-by-case vote, I guess, and control it that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12801)|
| 3:33:25| but you're going to have different bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12805)|
| 3:33:27| What's MPC going to do the next time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12807)|
| 3:33:30| There's just a lot open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12810)|
| 3:33:31| I appreciate you all's indulgence in listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12811)|
| 3:33:34| Again, it's more about process than it is Victor Jernigan's developments, but I do want to make it clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12814)|
| 3:33:40| He has, step by step by step by step, gotten his way is where he's headed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12820)|
| 3:33:46| The South Dory homeowners did not even oppose his original development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12826)|
| 3:33:52| and we still don't oppose it to this day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12832)|
| 3:33:54| We've told him, go ahead and build your original 82 condos, and we'll support you as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12834)|
| 3:34:00| So that's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12840)|
| 3:34:01| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12841)|
| 3:34:03| Do you have anything else, Commissioner DeFreeze?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12843)|
| 3:34:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12846)|
| 3:34:07| Thank you, Scott, for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12847)|
| 3:34:08| But that is not just Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12848)|
| 3:34:10| There's a lot of people in the community and even in other communities that have seen where I've posted on the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12850)|
| 3:34:16| forum that are very concerned about this precedent being set in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12856)|
| 3:34:20| And so I really believe that two public hearings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12860)|
| 3:34:23| and these public hearings are not exclusive just to Wells Creek development, but about this concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12863)|
| 3:34:29| So I don't think any of the previous meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12869)|
| 3:34:32| nor would the South Dory area homeowners meeting constitute these two public hearings that we need to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12872)|
| 3:34:39| Commissioner Luthor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12879)|
| 3:34:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12880)|
| 3:34:42| I'd like to ask the law director to opine on whether or not this needs to be an ordinance change or a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12882)|
| 3:34:51| It sounds to me like, as I've said here, that we are attempting to change the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12891)|
| 3:35:01| Do you not read it that way, Mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12901)|
| 3:35:04| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12904)|
| 3:35:05| We have a rezoning request to. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12905)|
| 3:35:10| It sounds like they're trying to make this, or Commissioner DeFreeze is trying to make this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12910)|
| 3:35:14| a broad policy of Knox County other than, you know, in addition to just this one zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12914)|
| 3:35:25| To the intent that requiring two additional public hearings every time we establish a planned residential district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12925)|
| 3:35:34| that would be a change in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12934)|
| 3:35:36| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12936)|
| 3:35:37| That's what, as I've said here and listened, it seems that we are adding provisions to the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12937)|
| 3:35:45| to the zoning ordinance, at least with respect to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12945)|
| 3:35:49| And that would require an ordinance amendment and two readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12949)|
| 3:36:01| It would be a change in the ordinance because if it's applied broadly for every time this situation comes up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12961)|
| 3:36:07| that we have to have two additional public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12967)|
| 3:36:10| Is that what you're stating, Commissioner DeFreeze?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12970)|
| 3:36:11| Or if it's just this one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12971)|
| 3:36:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12975)|
| 3:36:16| I guess that's the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12976)|
| 3:36:17| Let's make it this one time because then this is the first time that I'm aware that this application has been made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12977)|
| 3:36:23| and it is out in Wells Creek, so let's make it for this one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12983)|
| 3:36:28| Mr. Law Director, is that possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12988)|
| 3:36:31| I mean, I'm not against having public hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12991)|
| 3:36:35| I just want to make sure we're staying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12995)|
| 3:36:37| Nor am I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12997)|
| 3:36:38| But, I mean, you're basically tacking on a process to the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=12998)|
| 3:36:47| It gives me a great deal of heartburn to require it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13007)|
| 3:36:55| I know that you can through an ordinance, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13015)|
| 3:36:58| but by passing a resolution just directed at these parties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13018)|
| 3:37:04| I would question whether you have the authority to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13024)|
| 3:37:11| Well, I would like to see that this, I mean, Commissioner DeFreeze brings in a very valid point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13031)|
| 3:37:20| I think before Knox County goes further down this road, we need to have public hearings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13040)|
| 3:37:26| on whether or not this is something that Knox County wants to pursue or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13046)|
| 3:37:34| I think, like Commissioner Hammond said, we should have them somewhere in every community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13054)|
| 3:37:39| and have a chance to let the citizens of Knox County decide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13059)|
| 3:37:45| or at least have their input as to whether or not they think this is a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13065)|
| 3:37:51| Mark, I have to agree with Commissioner DeFreeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13071)|
| 3:37:55| This is unique or different because we're talking about multiple owners, not a single owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13075)|
| 3:38:02| combining maybe various parcels into one and then combining it together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13082)|
| 3:38:08| We're talking about we're taking rights from adjacent properties, bringing them into one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13088)|
| 3:38:17| without bringing in the ownership of those properties, just the rights to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13097)|
| 3:38:23| And I think that's where it's different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13103)|
| 3:38:25| And I think that's something that Knox County needs to take a step back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13105)|
| 3:38:30| and take a look at whether or not this is a good thing or a bad thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13110)|
| 3:38:33| As of I sit here today, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13113)|
| 3:38:35| I think there's probably instances that would be very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13115)|
| 3:38:39| But I can also see the argument where, in some cases, it could be detrimental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13119)|
| 3:38:44| And so I really would like to see some type of public hearings on whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13124)|
| 3:38:49| or not we want to go down this road or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13129)|
| 3:38:52| And I would like to support something to that, but I think we need to do it the right way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13132)|
| 3:38:56| And I guess I'm looking for guidance from the law director or Mark how we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13136)|
| 3:39:03| Have you not already had additional hearings regarding this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13143)|
| 3:39:07| This particular zoning case, I spoke with the South Doyle Homeowners Association last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13147)|
| 3:39:14| It's the only additional meeting that I am aware of outside of the regular rezoning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13154)|
| 3:39:22| Victor may have had other meetings with the Homeowners Association as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13162)|
| 3:39:28| But in every planned residential case, virtually every planned residential case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13168)|
| 3:39:34| there is a developer and there is an owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13174)|
| 3:39:37| In several and multiple planned residential zoning cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13177)|
| 3:39:42| there is a developer and more than one owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13182)|
| 3:39:45| In this particular case, there's a half a dozen other owners, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13185)|
| 3:39:50| But none of the piece of property that's going to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13190)|
| 3:39:54| I mean, if you're talking about multiple owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13194)|
| 3:39:56| you can have multiple owners on one piece of property, that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13196)|
| 3:39:59| But we're talking about ownership of properties that's not within the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13199)|
| 3:40:05| They just simply are going to be selling their rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13205)|
| 3:40:08| They will be within the development at the end of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13208)|
| 3:40:11| At the end of the day, there will be a new development plan approved for the entire district, all 29 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13211)|
| 3:40:18| Each of the individual, current individual property owners will be represented on that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13218)|
| 3:40:24| Will they still own it through Fee Simple?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13224)|
| 3:40:27| It's possible that they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13227)|
| 3:40:29| I don't know the arrangements that will be made, but they may reconfigure their lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13229)|
| 3:40:33| Well, you know, if they're still the owner, then they still, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13233)|
| 3:40:37| are they also giving up their rights to subdivide their property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13237)|
| 3:40:41| At the end of the day, say, let's just do really easy math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13241)|
| 3:40:45| 30 acres at 5 units the acre, there's 150 available housing units there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13245)|
| 3:40:53| If the development plan accounts for all 150 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13253)|
| 3:40:57| the people who are on their own lot don't have the right to subdivide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13257)|
| 3:41:02| and create another lot for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13262)|
| 3:41:05| Forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13265)|
| 3:41:06| Without going through a zoning case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13266)|
| 3:41:09| And in this case, it would be a plan amendment because we're right at the threshold of residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13269)|
| 3:41:17| What if they wanted to rezone it commercial, industrial, office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13277)|
| 3:41:22| They would have to go through a plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13282)|
| 3:41:24| So that's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13284)|
| 3:41:26| They wouldn't be selling off that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13286)|
| 3:41:28| They'd only be selling off their residential right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13288)|
| 3:41:30| They would have to rezone it and go through a plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13290)|
| 3:41:34| So that could still be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13294)|
| 3:41:36| And you've got to remember that when we have a certain amount of PR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13296)|
| 3:41:41| it does allow for a plan commercial, does it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13301)|
| 3:41:46| Or a commercial component?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13306)|
| 3:41:47| Would you have planned residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13307)|
| 3:41:49| It allows for one acre of commercial activity for every 100 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13309)|
| 3:41:54| So within a planned residential district with more than 100 units but less than 200,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13314)|
| 3:42:00| you could have one acre of commercial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13320)|
| 3:42:03| And so that would still be possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13323)|
| 3:42:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13324)|
| 3:42:05| That's under the current code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13325)|
| 3:42:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13327)|
| 3:42:11| Commissioner Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13331)|
| 3:42:14| Mark, help me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13334)|
| 3:42:16| Would this be the equivalent of buying mineral rights?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13336)|
| 3:42:19| I mean, you're not doing anything to the property currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13339)|
| 3:42:23| but you're actually buying the rights, kind of like mineral rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13343)|
| 3:42:31| I'm no mineral right expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13351)|
| 3:42:35| And you have surface rights and you have below surface rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13355)|
| 3:42:39| If a rancher has 20 acres and it's zoned PR 1 to 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13359)|
| 3:42:45| he has the right to develop 100 units on his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13365)|
| 3:42:50| If he sells it to a developer and desires to keep a 5-acre parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13370)|
| 3:42:55| he'll have his house on a 5-acre parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13375)|
| 3:42:59| and there could be 99 units on the balance of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13379)|
| 3:43:05| So that's the whole clustering concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13385)|
| 3:43:09| And that is a very ñ it's not uncommon to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13389)|
| 3:43:14| Many existing property owners retain their homestead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13394)|
| 3:43:18| and retain a large lot around it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13398)|
| 3:43:22| and thus cluster their rights somewhere else on the property within that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13402)|
| 3:43:28| Can you give us an example where that's been done in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13408)|
| 3:43:32| On our most recent MPC agenda in the area just north of Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13412)|
| 3:43:40| the developer added an additional parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13420)|
| 3:43:45| to an existing planned residential district at the same density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13425)|
| 3:43:50| and came in with a new development plan accounting for all of the units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13430)|
| 3:43:55| and recognizing a large lot for that most current owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13435)|
| 3:44:02| It was called Towering Oaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13442)|
| 3:44:04| I've forgotten. It's something, something at Turkey Creek now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13444)|
| 3:44:07| Out in the Corriton area, we had a very comparable case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13447)|
| 3:44:10| where almost a 100-acre parcel had PR zoning at 2 units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13450)|
| 3:44:21| So they had 200 units to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13461)|
| 3:44:24| The original owner retained a large parcel for themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13464)|
| 3:44:28| So there was 199 units on the balance of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13468)|
| 3:44:33| So on the balance of the property, the density was greater than 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13473)|
| 3:44:37| On the original owner's homestead, the density was less than 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13477)|
| 3:44:45| Quite often there are multiple parcels assembled to create a single zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13485)|
| 3:44:53| Mark, can I guess what I'm hearing is there's a lot of concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13493)|
| 3:44:59| about what will happen to that property later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13499)|
| 3:45:03| Obviously, we're not all going to be around here forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13503)|
| 3:45:06| And, you know, I guess I'm concerned, too, about where this could go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13506)|
| 3:45:14| and how quickly we could go from having, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13514)|
| 3:45:20| a development that might even be sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13520)|
| 3:45:24| Someone else buys it and says, well, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13524)|
| 3:45:26| I want to do these other things on these other pieces of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13526)|
| 3:45:29| And all of a sudden you have a community built right in the middle of somewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13529)|
| 3:45:34| where it was never intended for you guys to build a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13534)|
| 3:45:37| because you're not always going to be on MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13537)|
| 3:45:40| You know, eventually you'll retire and someone else will be in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13540)|
| 3:45:46| And I think that's the concern that some of the commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13546)|
| 3:45:50| it sounds like some of the citizens have is, is there any way to stop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13550)|
| 3:45:55| I think it sounds like what Mr. Jernigan is talking about doing may be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13555)|
| 3:46:00| But what happens around what we're now calling green space is, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13560)|
| 3:46:05| what could be detrimental to an area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13565)|
| 3:46:09| The planned residential zone district takes that into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13569)|
| 3:46:13| by requiring that second step of development plan approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13573)|
| 3:46:18| so that you have an accounting system for all of the rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13578)|
| 3:46:22| and you have a site plan that's approved that shows you preserved open space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13582)|
| 3:46:26| and perhaps the occasional convenience store if the PR is large enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13586)|
| 3:46:33| and the lots that were owned by the original owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13593)|
| 3:46:39| The development plan acts in lieu of deed restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13599)|
| 3:46:43| No development can occur without approval of a development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13603)|
| 3:46:47| and all building permits have to be built in accordance with that development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13607)|
| 3:46:53| And further, when we shift over to the subdivision regulation track,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13613)|
| 3:46:59| the concept plan, which is the first step in the subdivision regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13619)|
| 3:47:04| has to correspond with the development plan that's been approved by the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13624)|
| 3:47:08| and any final plats have to be in compliance with the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13628)|
| 3:47:14| So there are checks and balances that act in lieu of deed restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13634)|
| 3:47:18| In the event that all of the housing rights are used up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13638)|
| 3:47:22| in order for somebody to take their two-acre parcel and subdivide it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13642)|
| 3:47:26| they would have to rezone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13646)|
| 3:47:28| Okay, but obviously let's do, for instance, if Mr. Jernigan does his development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13648)|
| 3:47:35| and these owners retain the rights to their land, he builds out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13655)|
| 3:47:40| they decide they want to put a commercial strip on each one of their properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13660)|
| 3:47:46| I mean, they could do that immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13666)|
| 3:47:48| There's nothing that would hold them back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13668)|
| 3:47:50| And based upon what you're saying, that would be perfectly legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13670)|
| 3:47:53| upon the way MPC is set up currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13673)|
| 3:47:57| Under that scenario, they would have to get a plan amendment approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13677)|
| 3:48:03| and they would have to have a new zoning district approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13683)|
| 3:48:06| in order to do commercial development in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13686)|
| 3:48:10| But, again, that's just another process that a developer would go through anyway, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13690)|
| 3:48:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13695)|
| 3:48:18| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13698)|
| 3:48:21| I don't know who I want to ask first, but Mark, since you're there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13701)|
| 3:48:23| I'll go ahead and just ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13703)|
| 3:48:25| And, Victor, I've got some questions for you too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13705)|
| 3:48:28| You know, Mr. Chairman, I've heard you say several times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13708)|
| 3:48:31| and I really appreciate the way that you mention this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13711)|
| 3:48:33| You talk about not getting in the school people's business, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13713)|
| 3:48:36| let's stay out of their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13716)|
| 3:48:37| And I sort of look at this as MPC business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13717)|
| 3:48:40| Mark, in your opinion, you know, you're the professional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13720)|
| 3:48:44| Do you think that this is something needed or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13724)|
| 3:48:48| Or is this something that you and your staff can monitor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13728)|
| 3:48:51| and you make recommendations in the future up or down to MPC commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13731)|
| 3:48:56| Do you think this is something that we need or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13736)|
| 3:49:00| This is a rezoning case that's very comparable to all of the other rezoning cases that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13740)|
| 3:49:06| So you pretty much make your recommendations like you normally do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13746)|
| 3:49:09| Victor, I've got some questions for you just real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13749)|
| 3:49:13| I ain't got time for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13753)|
| 3:49:18| How many homeowner meetings have you had?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13758)|
| 3:49:22| You've done this how long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13762)|
| 3:49:25| A long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13765)|
| 3:49:26| A long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13766)|
| 3:49:27| I don't know, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13767)|
| 3:49:31| I'm talking about for this particular project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13771)|
| 3:49:33| This particular project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13773)|
| 3:49:36| I've been to South Dole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13776)|
| 3:49:37| I've appeared at South Dole twice on the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13777)|
| 3:49:40| I've talked to several members of the South Dole Homeowners Association half a dozen more times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13780)|
| 3:49:45| I'm going to be at the meeting on the 2nd of September to discuss the project further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13785)|
| 3:49:52| How much money have you spent without getting a return?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13792)|
| 3:49:55| I mean, give us an idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13795)|
| 3:49:59| It's a significant sum of money by my standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13799)|
| 3:50:09| Without getting into the specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13809)|
| 3:50:10| More than most homes cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13810)|
| 3:50:12| Well, there's two commas in the money so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13812)|
| 3:50:16| So it's quite significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13816)|
| 3:50:18| And the issue is that we are, Mr. Lithold, Commissioner Lithold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13818)|
| 3:50:24| working within the framework of what's permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13824)|
| 3:50:26| You can't, it'll be a subdivision plat of the entire 140, 445 possible homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13826)|
| 3:50:35| The subdivision plat will be recorded as a subdivision plat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13835)|
| 3:50:39| The restrictions of the subdivision will be recorded on the plat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13839)|
| 3:50:44| that we're going to be doing is quite similar, candidly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13844)|
| 3:50:47| to the condominiums that we were originally going to build on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13847)|
| 3:50:51| if they were clustered on a portion of the property of the original 17 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13851)|
| 3:50:56| The conversations are tending to throw a lot of red herrings out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13856)|
| 3:51:01| that don't affect the way that the process works in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13861)|
| 3:51:06| This isn't something that's unusual from the process of the way it's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13866)|
| 3:51:11| The people are going to continue to own the property where their house is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13871)|
| 3:51:14| They're going to continue to be able to live there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13874)|
| 3:51:18| do whatever they want to sell the property as a residential piece of property in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13878)|
| 3:51:23| Our development, I have first right of refusal on the person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13883)|
| 3:51:26| not that it makes any difference to this particular situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13886)|
| 3:51:29| but we have maintained first right of refusal on the property if it ever goes to sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13889)|
| 3:51:34| The property is a residential zoned property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13894)|
| 3:51:37| I will be the first to oppose it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13897)|
| 3:51:41| Because what we've done is we're implementing the restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13901)|
| 3:51:44| about access to Tipton Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13904)|
| 3:51:48| We are already implementing those design elements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13908)|
| 3:51:53| that we continually have heard from homeowner groups about subdivision and subdivision plats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13913)|
| 3:51:58| It's not these homeowners, if they had zoned their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13918)|
| 3:52:03| one homeowner owns three and a half acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13923)|
| 3:52:07| they could go in and put 17 houses on their property under low density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13927)|
| 3:52:12| Now that three and a half acres is going to be protected as green space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13932)|
| 3:52:16| They're allowed to put two more homes on the property when we finish with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13936)|
| 3:52:19| and the rest of the density will be clustered on our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13939)|
| 3:52:23| It is the way that every environmental organization in the world recommends developing property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13943)|
| 3:52:33| by clustering it and maintaining it together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13953)|
| 3:52:36| We're not doing anything outside of the framework of what's done in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13956)|
| 3:52:40| except for the way that we continue to pay fees to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13960)|
| 3:52:44| We continue to go to public hearings to keep people informed about a process that is normal and common.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13964)|
| 3:52:51| We're trying to work within the framework and what the guidelines are as we move the projects forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13971)|
| 3:52:57| How many times have you been for MPC in this body on this particular project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13977)|
| 3:53:02| Four, five, five times, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13982)|
| 3:53:05| And you started the project when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13985)|
| 3:53:08| Early 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13988)|
| 3:53:10| January, I think it was January 2007 was when we had the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13990)|
| 3:53:15| Of the votes that have been taken, when there's been votes, how many of you won?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13995)|
| 3:53:19| How many of you lost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=13999)|
| 3:53:20| The only time we've ever lost, we've always had, and the project has moved forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14000)|
| 3:53:26| we've always had positive staff recommendations for the plans that we've put forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14006)|
| 3:53:30| and overwhelming support at MPC commission for the plans as the way they were designed and moved forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14010)|
| 3:53:36| You know, commissioners, I don't have a problem with what we're trying to do here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14016)|
| 3:53:40| but I think Mark pretty much stated it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14020)|
| 3:53:42| I mean, I think we're getting into some business that's already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14022)|
| 3:53:45| I'm relying on MPC to tell us on projects now and in the future, if it's a good project, bad project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14025)|
| 3:53:51| what the density is, what not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14031)|
| 3:53:53| You know, I don't want to try to reinvent the world every time we come here and try to reinvent everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14033)|
| 3:53:58| You know, and I'll say this again, not everybody that came before us was a blooming idiot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14038)|
| 3:54:02| So I'm going to be, I'm not going to be supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14042)|
| 3:54:05| I rely on MPC and I'm tired of this gentleman having to come up here a month after me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14045)|
| 3:54:11| He's already spent over a million dollars and he's not got a thing to show for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14051)|
| 3:54:15| So I feel for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14055)|
| 3:54:17| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14057)|
| 3:54:22| Mark, are there any zoning circumstances where we require four hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14062)|
| 3:54:29| which I'm assuming we're talking about two additional hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14069)|
| 3:54:33| Is there any type of zoning that we do where we require four public hearings instead of two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14073)|
| 3:54:43| Not as a requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14083)|
| 3:54:45| Sometimes that's the way it works out, but not as a requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14085)|
| 3:54:50| Because this is a bad idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14090)|
| 3:54:52| If we do this as a resolution and we do it one time on one piece of property, it's bad public policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14092)|
| 3:55:01| And it may well open us up to a lawsuit if we single out one development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14101)|
| 3:55:05| and say we're going to require you to hold a different standard that we don't require other developments to hold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14105)|
| 3:55:14| I think that may create some legal action that Victor would be entitled to bring against us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14114)|
| 3:55:22| If we do this as an ordinance, there's no telling how many pieces of property this is going to affect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14122)|
| 3:55:30| that it's going to require four rather than two public hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14130)|
| 3:55:35| That's why I'm bringing the substitute motion that we deny this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14135)|
| 3:55:39| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14139)|
| 3:55:41| We have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14141)|
| 3:55:42| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14142)|
| 3:55:45| We have a motion to deny and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14145)|
| 3:55:50| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14150)|
| 3:55:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14154)|
| 3:55:56| What we have here is there's not going to be any more houses built there than if he owns this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14156)|
| 3:56:02| What we have here is a problem that I don't know whether we can do it on this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14162)|
| 3:56:07| but it needs to be taken forward that somehow we have to handle it like mineral rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14167)|
| 3:56:14| When this property is sold, whoever buys it has no right for any future development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14174)|
| 3:56:20| It needs to be recorded in the deed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14180)|
| 3:56:23| Now, I think Mr. Jarnigan here has been more than fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14183)|
| 3:56:28| He's came to the homeowner's association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14188)|
| 3:56:30| He's talked about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14190)|
| 3:56:32| And here's something that most people here are overlooking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14192)|
| 3:56:34| Do you mind stepping up just a minute, Mr. Jarnigan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14194)|
| 3:56:38| Be sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14198)|
| 3:56:39| With Judge Fancher's ruling about where we couldn't change the sector plan, that was up to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14199)|
| 3:56:47| They approved you for 12 apartments and an acre, didn't they, MPC, a change of the sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14207)|
| 3:56:52| Approximately 234 units, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14212)|
| 3:56:56| You could go to court right now probably and go back with apartments on his ruling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14216)|
| 3:57:00| if his judgment comes down that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14220)|
| 3:57:03| I could have gone to court several months ago, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14223)|
| 3:57:05| That might would be cheaper for him to do that than what he's going through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14225)|
| 3:57:09| I don't know what he's paying for these development rights, is what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14229)|
| 3:57:13| But all I'm saying is I can see both sides of the story, the people in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14233)|
| 3:57:18| but the people have expressed to me out there what they're worried about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14238)|
| 3:57:22| is not Mr. Jarnigan's development about how many he's got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14242)|
| 3:57:26| because if he bought the property, he could still build that many houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14246)|
| 3:57:29| But they want this property that he's buying the rights from to where nobody can ever do anything for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14249)|
| 3:57:34| that they're protected that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14254)|
| 3:57:36| And that will be in the subdivision plat that's required by filing by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14256)|
| 3:57:42| We are providing the additional security of the deed restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14262)|
| 3:57:45| and new surveys for each of those pieces of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14265)|
| 3:57:49| Well, Mr. Law Director, is there anything that we can do to let these people know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14269)|
| 3:57:56| that when they're selling their development rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14276)|
| 3:58:00| that they're giving up that right to the future owner by recording in a deed in some way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14280)|
| 3:58:05| You know, when you give a man an easement through your property there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14285)|
| 3:58:08| I don't care if it's 500 years from now, that easement stays with that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14288)|
| 3:58:19| So you would hope that whoever is involved in the development of this or in selling their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14299)|
| 3:58:28| you would hope that they would seek private counsel about what their rights are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14308)|
| 3:58:34| if they're not adequately explained by the developer and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14314)|
| 3:58:40| I don't know what else we can do as a body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14320)|
| 3:58:48| The issue of ownership, if you think in terms of conservation easements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14328)|
| 3:58:54| which everybody is trying to get somebody to put on a piece of property to maintain open space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14334)|
| 3:58:59| or to leave it as open space, that property owner still owns that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14339)|
| 3:59:03| They own it into perpetuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14343)|
| 3:59:04| Some of the nicest properties available for sure have conservation easements on them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14344)|
| 3:59:10| where the property remains in the family for generations forever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14350)|
| 3:59:14| with the conservation easements on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14354)|
| 3:59:17| Basically, all we've done is create conservation easements on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14357)|
| 3:59:22| If you want to look at it in the simplest terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14362)|
| 3:59:24| we've created conservation easements on the property that adjoin us under one planned residential zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14364)|
| 3:59:32| Again, we are trying to use the best design standards available in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14372)|
| 3:59:37| and in the United States to work on the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14377)|
| 3:59:43| Commissioner DeFreeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14383)|
| 3:59:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14385)|
| 3:59:46| I would like to hear from Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14386)|
| 3:59:48| I think he had something else to add, and then I'd like to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14388)|
| 3:59:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14392)|
| 3:59:54| I'll try and keep this brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14394)|
| 3:59:58| First off, a few points of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14398)|
| 4:00:03| Again, Mr. Jernigan has pointed out that he came before the homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14403)|
| 4:00:08| He's only been before us one time to present his idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14408)|
| 4:00:11| The last time we had Mr. Donaldson come out to speak to us primarily about the process that they go through at MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14411)|
| 4:00:20| it did turn into a discussion more so about Mr. Jernigan's property as he took the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14420)|
| 4:00:29| I asked one question during that is, what about deed restrictions, Mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14429)|
| 4:00:33| Mark said no, and he's already confirmed that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14433)|
| 4:00:37| Knox County, through MPC, has no right to require this man to do anything with regard to deed restriction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14437)|
| 4:00:44| Now, with regard to easement, again, I'm no lawyer, and I'd like to hear what the law director has to say about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14444)|
| 4:00:51| If someone gives me an easement to cross their property, I can relinquish that easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14451)|
| 4:00:59| I can go back and say I no longer need that easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14459)|
| 4:01:02| I'll go back to being landlocked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14462)|
| 4:01:04| Or I'll give up that easement and then buy your property from you and redevelop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14464)|
| 4:01:11| I think through this discussion you all have heard why this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14471)|
| 4:01:17| Mr. Jernigan, as far as the money he spent, he could have built his condos over a year ago and been done with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14477)|
| 4:01:25| But, no, how many times?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14485)|
| 4:01:27| Five times to MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14487)|
| 4:01:28| What does that tell you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14488)|
| 4:01:30| We're piecemealing this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14490)|
| 4:01:32| This is why we're here today and why it's an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14492)|
| 4:01:35| We've got to look out for Knox County as well as its property owners and the citizens of this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14495)|
| 4:01:42| Everybody keeps saying, I don't know what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14502)|
| 4:01:44| Well, two more meetings in an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14504)|
| 4:01:48| Let me tell you, the two meetings, you all are missing the point on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14508)|
| 4:01:52| Right, here's what you need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14512)|
| 4:01:54| If we want to do this in Knox County, here is a transfer of development rights ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14514)|
| 4:01:59| It's done all over the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14519)|
| 4:02:01| We talk about it's common.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14521)|
| 4:02:03| This is getting to be very common, and we're getting ready to see more of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14523)|
| 4:02:06| This is a method of a conservation easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14526)|
| 4:02:09| This is what needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14529)|
| 4:02:11| Now, if it needs to go through MPC to do that, you know, we're open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14531)|
| 4:02:15| We're willing to participate as part of this community and go that route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14535)|
| 4:02:20| I'm going to close with one thing again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14540)|
| 4:02:23| In our opinion, and I think it's very evident here, and it may have been done on the other side of town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14543)|
| 4:02:28| as we're already getting in trouble, this is nothing more than a mechanism to get around zoning issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14548)|
| 4:02:37| If you can't get it zoned medium-density residential, it's a way to get around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14557)|
| 4:02:44| If the sector plan calls for low-density residential, but you want to build medium-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14564)|
| 4:02:50| this is a way to get around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14570)|
| 4:02:52| Is this really how we want to do zoning in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14572)|
| 4:02:55| This is kind of like the spot zoning issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14575)|
| 4:02:57| We're just kind of willy-nilly, let's take this, twist this, do that, and we do whatever we want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14577)|
| 4:03:02| So I think we're treading on thin ice here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14582)|
| 4:03:05| I would recommend, oh, one last point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14585)|
| 4:03:07| This body is an elected body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14587)|
| 4:03:11| I trust MPC to do okay, but I don't want to rely on one or two individuals to set the development standards for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14591)|
| 4:03:20| It needs to be a joint effort, and the people need to have a say-so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14600)|
| 4:03:24| And just going into MPC when people don't really know what they're dealing with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14604)|
| 4:03:29| because these people that have made this deal with Mr. Jernigan, they're not even a party to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14609)|
| 4:03:36| Where are they legally responsible to the rest of the community and to this county in this process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14616)|
| 4:03:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14624)|
| 4:03:45| Either way, Scott, it sounds like you're talking about an ordinance amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14625)|
| 4:03:50| You're talking about a transfer of development rights ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14630)|
| 4:03:55| We're talking about changing the zoning ordinance to correct the situation that you see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14635)|
| 4:04:02| To better address it, you know, for example, this one I've got is just I pulled it off line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14642)|
| 4:04:08| It's for a county up north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14648)|
| 4:04:11| But it says here under one section, it says TDR easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14651)|
| 4:04:17| The form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14657)|
| 4:04:18| At the time that that development rights are sold to the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14658)|
| 4:04:21| the seller shall enter into a TDR easement with the town and the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14661)|
| 4:04:27| not the developer, with the town and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14667)|
| 4:04:30| The TDR easement shall be prepared by the town and shall serve the following purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14670)|
| 4:04:35| The TDR easement shall track the conveyance of development rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14675)|
| 4:04:39| The TDR easement shall be a conservation easement that confirms that the sending property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14679)|
| 4:04:45| the people that are giving up their right can may continue to be used for agricultural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14685)|
| 4:04:49| open space or recreational purposes, but not be used for residential development purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14689)|
| 4:04:56| That is in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14696)|
| 4:04:58| That's a commitment to the county and the rest of the surrounding property owners recording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14698)|
| 4:05:04| Mr. Pinson mentioned this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14704)|
| 4:05:06| The TDR easement shall be recorded in the Blank County Register of Deeds office with a copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14706)|
| 4:05:14| So this is how it's supposed to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14714)|
| 4:05:17| I highly recommend that whatever this county needs to do and whatever the next step is, this is what it's all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14717)|
| 4:05:22| Whether it's two hearings, ten hearings or this development or the next development, we better get a handle on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14722)|
| 4:05:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14728)|
| 4:05:32| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14732)|
| 4:05:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14733)|
| 4:05:34| The examples that were cited that have happened in Farragut and up in Corrington, to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14734)|
| 4:05:39| those sounded like one large property owner who relinquished and he really minimized his own space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14739)|
| 4:05:47| and allowed other people to move on it with him selling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14747)|
| 4:05:49| Is that correct, Mr. Donaldson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14749)|
| 4:05:52| Well, in each of those cases that I can recall, they maintained fairly large lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14752)|
| 4:05:59| They probably maximized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14759)|
| 4:06:00| But they sold off, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14760)|
| 4:06:03| Ultimately, they sold off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14763)|
| 4:06:04| They didn't sell their own lot, but they sold off the balance of their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14764)|
| 4:06:08| But this example that is happening out at Wells Creek and South Knoxville sounds like a parasitic amoeba| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14768)|
| 4:06:16| because you have the one central configuration of PR zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14776)|
| 4:06:22| and then you're creating a new district to incorporate more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14782)|
| 4:06:26| But the original developer, he's transferring those units onto his property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14786)|
| 4:06:31| and I think that's a little bit unusual and unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14791)|
| 4:06:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14793)|
| 4:06:35| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14795)|
| 4:06:37| Yes, Mr. Jernigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14797)|
| 4:06:39| I really just have a simple question as to why are you doing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14799)|
| 4:06:48| Well, we are trying in every neighborhood in which we work to take the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14808)|
| 4:07:00| to work with the neighborhood to come up with concept plans and designs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14820)|
| 4:07:05| that meet the basic needs of what the neighborhood is working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14825)|
| 4:07:10| We have been in northeast Knoxville working on the assemblage of property out there for almost seven years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14830)|
| 4:07:16| and haven't broken ground on a project as we begin to assemble| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14836)|
| 4:07:19| because we knew we had more properties to acquire in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14839)|
| 4:07:23| It is a situation that Mr. Ballard is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14843)|
| 4:07:27| We could have gone forward and built the condominiums on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14847)|
| 4:07:31| that we were originally planned to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14851)|
| 4:07:34| While we were in the process, we had originally the original property was a five-part assemblage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14854)|
| 4:07:42| The property at that time, we wanted to bring it forward for medium-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14862)|
| 4:07:47| because it is the most logical place in all of South Knoxville for medium-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14867)|
| 4:07:53| But there was not a justification that we could find at that time for a request to change the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14873)|
| 4:07:59| While we are moving the project forward, we realize the opportunity of what is going to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14879)|
| 4:08:05| with the road improvements to South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14885)|
| 4:08:07| We realize the fact that we can get a traffic signal on John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14887)|
| 4:08:11| We recognize that the sector plan is going through enormous change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14891)|
| 4:08:14| with the thousands of employees that are at Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14894)|
| 4:08:19| And separate to all of that, we have one of the top apartment companies in the south, for sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14899)|
| 4:08:24| as one of our joint venture partners in other projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14904)|
| 4:08:28| So we thought that market rate apartments on this property were the perfect smart growth opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14908)|
| 4:08:36| the perfect location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14916)|
| 4:08:38| The traffic studies indicated it would take traffic off John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14918)|
| 4:08:41| We could get all of this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14921)|
| 4:08:43| The neighborhood is upset with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14923)|
| 4:08:47| We go back. We revisit the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14927)|
| 4:08:50| We look at alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14930)|
| 4:08:53| They want condominiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14933)|
| 4:08:54| There's a housing type that hasn't been built in Knoxville before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14934)|
| 4:08:57| It's referred to as the big house condominiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14937)|
| 4:09:00| We decided that we were going to do this on a project north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14940)|
| 4:09:03| We've shown this to the property owners out there several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14943)|
| 4:09:06| And we're going to develop the same type of condominiums on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14946)|
| 4:09:09| So the long answer is that we're trying to do what the neighborhood is asking us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14949)|
| 4:09:15| They said they wanted the area developed as low-density residential zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14955)|
| 4:09:20| We are developing it under low-density residential zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14960)|
| 4:09:24| The issue is that there's going to be a new subdivision plat filed for all the properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14964)|
| 4:09:29| All the property owners who are currently involved in the rezoning are going to sign that plat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14969)|
| 4:09:38| Nothing can be done to their properties again in the future unless there's ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14978)|
| 4:09:43| I can't envision a situation legally that would entitle them to do something else with their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14983)|
| 4:09:49| other than maintain it as a house and or open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14989)|
| 4:09:53| Those would be the only options that would be left under the subdivision plat that will be filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14993)|
| 4:09:57| We're not doing anything that's unusual in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=14997)|
| 4:10:01| We've got 29 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15001)|
| 4:10:03| It's a planned residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15003)|
| 4:10:05| We're taking the 144 permitted units and we're clustering those that aren't used by the other property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15005)|
| 4:10:11| onto our own property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15011)|
| 4:10:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15014)|
| 4:10:15| Now, of the 29 acres, how much do you own?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15015)|
| 4:10:19| How many acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15019)|
| 4:10:20| We'll own, when the process is finished, we'll own about 22 of those acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15020)|
| 4:10:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15024)|
| 4:10:25| So the 17 acres that Mr. Ballard was speaking of, that was what you had originally had zoned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15025)|
| 4:10:31| It was right at 18 acres originally zoned, but that's what we had originally zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15031)|
| 4:10:35| The process of trying to work through and implement smart growth policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15035)|
| 4:10:42| and low‑impact stormwater policies, somebody has to be first in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15042)|
| 4:10:49| People ask all the time, they do that somewhere else, why don't we do it here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15049)|
| 4:10:54| We had gotten to a situation for sure where we could begin to implement those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15054)|
| 4:10:58| and somebody has to be first in using good, smart growth planning for low‑impact stormwater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15058)|
| 4:11:04| for clustering of development, and maintaining green space in neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15064)|
| 4:11:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15067)|
| 4:11:08| So you have a total of 29 acres and you will develop 22?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15068)|
| 4:11:16| We'll own 22 in fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15076)|
| 4:11:19| The development itself is still going to be basically on 18, 19 acres of total land area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15079)|
| 4:11:25| So you're only going to build on 18 acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15085)|
| 4:11:29| The original 18 acres that you had zoned for low‑density residential, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15089)|
| 4:11:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15094)|
| 4:11:35| The total development, the primary development will be basically on what will amount to 19 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15095)|
| 4:11:41| but of the 19 acres of the 22 that we're going to own in fee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15101)|
| 4:11:45| the actual development is on like 14 acres or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15105)|
| 4:11:50| So in our original plan we would have had two and a half or three acres of green space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15110)|
| 4:11:55| and as the plan will continue to move forward we'll have more green space now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15115)|
| 4:12:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15120)|
| 4:12:02| So of the 29 acres, seven of those acres will still be with individual property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15122)|
| 4:12:10| You will just own their development rights or however you want to phrase it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15130)|
| 4:12:15| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15135)|
| 4:12:16| Well, their property will be part of a new subdivision plat that will be filed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15136)|
| 4:12:21| and their house that they have will count as one unit of density in the overall subdivision plat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15141)|
| 4:12:32| Right, and then the rest of the density will transfer onto your 14 acres that you're building them on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15152)|
| 4:12:39| Right, exactly the same is done every single MPC commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15159)|
| 4:12:46| So of those 14 acres then, you'll have five units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15166)|
| 4:12:51| which will give you a total of how many units will you build on that 14 then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15171)|
| 4:12:56| Right now I think the plan is going to be we're going to do about 133, 134 total units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15176)|
| 4:13:03| Okay, and so originally when you came before this body, they approved 82 to 85.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15183)|
| 4:13:10| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15190)|
| 4:13:11| On the original track of ground, we asked for five units an acre and it was approved for five units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15191)|
| 4:13:17| So you will essentially get close to 60 additional units, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15197)|
| 4:13:25| So really the answer to the why is dollars, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15205)|
| 4:13:29| You'll obviously make more money, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15209)|
| 4:13:31| No, let me say that quite clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15211)|
| 4:13:33| The answer isn't dollars and making more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15213)|
| 4:13:36| The answer is that we are using more land area as green space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15216)|
| 4:13:44| than would be allowed under the individual properties being able to be rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15224)|
| 4:13:51| Instead of having 144 different rooftops, we're going to concentrate the units in a smaller footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15231)|
| 4:13:59| There will be less storm water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15239)|
| 4:14:00| It's a better plan for the overall development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15240)|
| 4:14:03| The opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15243)|
| 4:14:05| And I understand that, Mr. Jernigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15245)|
| 4:14:07| What you're saying is that everybody has talked about concentration of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15247)|
| 4:14:11| And I understand your argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15251)|
| 4:14:13| What I'm saying is that this body only approved on that parcel of land 82 to 85 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15253)|
| 4:14:21| And what you're trying to do is kind of go around the barn instead of through the barn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15261)|
| 4:14:26| And that's where a lot of people, where you hear a lot of concern from a lot of individuals and myself as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15266)|
| 4:14:32| is that we have a system and policies in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15272)|
| 4:14:37| but yet you're trying to maneuver those policies to incorporate what you want done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15277)|
| 4:14:43| and not what this community has done, what the sector plans have agreed upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15283)|
| 4:14:47| And this is the concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15287)|
| 4:14:49| Now, whether or not you may have one of the best quality products out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15289)|
| 4:14:53| you know, I'm not trying to discredit your reputation or the buildings that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15293)|
| 4:14:59| What I'm saying is that I do, I agree with Mr. Ballard in that there are serious concerns with the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15299)|
| 4:15:05| And that's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15305)|
| 4:15:07| The process, if I bought the property, Ms. Davis, if I went to the trouble of buying the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15307)|
| 4:15:18| and then I cut out the individual home lots as part of the planned residential zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15318)|
| 4:15:24| and I sold them back to the homeowners, it would be the same net effect that we're going through right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15324)|
| 4:15:30| except I would be the property owner of record of all the properties as they were moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15330)|
| 4:15:34| There would be a new survey put out for their individual properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15334)|
| 4:15:38| and the zoning district would remain the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15338)|
| 4:15:41| The properties would be able to be subdivided out because it would be within the zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15341)|
| 4:15:45| We're not trying to circumvent anything, and I candidly do not like that term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15345)|
| 4:15:50| because we are working within the framework of the Knox County Metropolitan Plan Commission's guide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15350)|
| 4:15:57| the specific request of the South Dwell homeowners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15357)|
| 4:16:00| who said they wanted a planned residential, low-density planned residential zone district for South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15360)|
| 4:16:06| And that's exactly what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15366)|
| 4:16:08| We're not doing anything else other than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15368)|
| 4:16:11| We are combining the density on the property, and certainly I have not acquired the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15371)|
| 4:16:17| but it is legal and right if I wanted to try to jump through a lot more hoops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15377)|
| 4:16:23| If I was truly trying to circumvent the issue, I would have just entered into contracts to purchase all the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15383)|
| 4:16:30| and then re-subdivided it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080825part1?start=15390)|
