| 0:12:22| Mr. Chairman, since I think what we did last year is since most ever were down to this 11 people that we got a lot of doubling up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=742)|
| 0:12:33| that we just you went down the line one by one and we just did it here in full, you know, each committee by rotation, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=753)|
| 0:12:45| Are you talking about instead of recess and just going through the committees and picking a chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=765)|
| 0:12:49| Yes, because if we did that, we'd have some of us would have to go to three different meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=769)|
| 0:12:55| OK. So if nobody objects, what we'll do is each standing committee has been noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=775)|
| 0:13:07| Even if you recess and call them on, you really won't have to leave as long as the people who are only on the committees vote for their chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=787)|
| 0:13:17| And you all can click through it. But they have been individually noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=797)|
| 0:13:21| OK. So what we're going to do is what we're going to do is start with a cable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=801)|
| 0:13:31| Cable to everybody anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=811)|
| 0:13:41| Before we move on, we need on number three. We voted on those standing committees separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=821)|
| 0:13:46| We need a motion to accept all the standing committees and accept the resolution and approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| Someone second. All right. We have a motion and second. All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=830)|
| 0:13:56| Yeah, let's have it. Now we're going to start with the cable TV committee, which is a full committee of the full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=836)|
| 0:14:04| And we'll need to take nominations for chair of cable TV. Nominate Jeff Ornby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=844)|
| 0:14:13| Commissioner Ornby has been nominated as chairman. Any other nominations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=853)|
| 0:14:20| Is there a motion to nomination cease?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=860)|
| 0:14:24| We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=864)|
| 0:14:30| Any opposed. Commissioner Ornby is the chair. We need to nominate a vice chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=870)|
| 0:14:36| We need to nominate Sam McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=876)|

| 0:14:46| A motion that nomination cease. Voted by an acclamation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=886)|
| 0:14:53| Who's the motion? Commissioner Burroughs. Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=893)|
| 0:14:58| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=898)|

| 0:15:22| All right. On the court subcommittee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=922)|
| 0:15:29| We got five people and that's all it can vote and nominate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=929)|
| 0:15:34| Is there a motion? I'll nominate Mike Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=934)|
| 0:15:39| OK. Is that OK with you, Mike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=939)|
| 0:15:47| Is there any other nominations for chair? Is there a motion that nomination cease and vote by acclamation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=947)|
| 0:15:55| We have a motion and a second. We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=955)|

| 0:25:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=1557)|
| 0:25:59| You know, I attended this last month, and you really need to know what you're doing in that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=1559)|
| 0:26:07| And I know Mr. Brantley does understand this because he did this for the corporation for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=1567)|
| 0:26:13| and it would make me feel good if he did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=1573)|
| 0:26:17| I would be happy if he did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=1577)|
| 0:26:20| Well, he may not want to, but he understands it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=1580)|
| 0:26:24| Yeah, I think it's Commissioner Brantley, are you willing to serve in that role?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=1584)|
| 0:26:28| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=1588)|
| 0:26:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=1589)|
| 0:26:35| And do we have anybody else willing to put their name in the hat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=1595)|
| 0:26:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=1599)|
| 0:26:40| We need a motion for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=1600)|

| 0:26:44| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=1604)|
| 0:26:47| Item 10 is a resolution appointing or reappointing three commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=1607)|
| 0:27:02| and appointing Dave Shields to the Knox County Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| This is Resolution R-14-9-106-SS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=1625)|
| 0:27:11| If I may, this is another committee that's very, very important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=1631)|
| 0:27:14| and I think there are two of us at least that should carry over onto that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=1634)|
| 0:27:20| Commissioner Wright and myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| And I also know that Commissioner Ownby has expressed an interest in serving on the audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=1642)|
| 0:27:27| if that suits everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| I'd like to put my name in the pot for that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| Mike Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=1651)|
| 0:27:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=1652)|
| 0:27:33| Commissioner Wright, Commissioner Brolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=1653)|
| 0:27:43| I'm nominating Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=1663)|
| 0:27:57| So we have three spots, and we'll have four nominations unless there's any others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=1677)|
| 0:28:05| So what we'll do is we'll go around the room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=1685)|
| 0:28:10| and take votes, and the bottom one drops off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=1690)|
| 0:28:14| Would you mention the three nominees again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=1696)|
| 0:28:17| Commissioner Wright, Commissioner Brolls, Commissioner Ownby, and Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=1697)|
| 0:28:21| Let's do each spot, each slot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=1701)|
| 0:28:26| Because you could have two ones, I guess, couldn't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=1706)|
| 0:28:38| Let's do them one slot at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=1718)|
| 0:28:41| Starting in the first district, we'll make a nomination, and then everybody's name pops back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=1721)|
| 0:28:48| And so does that make sense to everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140908?start=1728)|
