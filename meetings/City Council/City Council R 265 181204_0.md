| 0:00:30| Good evening everyone. I'll call this meeting to order. This is Knoxville City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=30)|
| 0:00:34| Council on Tuesday, December 4th, 2018. We will begin with the invocation which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=34)|
| 0:00:42| will be given by Councilwoman McKenzie and the pledge will be led by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=42)|
| 0:00:45| Councilman Stair. Stand please and bow our heads. Gracious and Heavenly Father,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=45)|
| 0:00:52| we thank you for this day. We thank you for the opportunity to serve. We ask that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=52)|
| 0:00:56| you would bless our city, our state, and our country. Lord, please have mercy on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=56)|
| 0:01:01| those who are less fortunate. Bless our men and women who have pledged to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=61)|
| 0:01:05| protect and serve us and please can continue to be with us through this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=65)|
| 0:01:09| holiday season. Amen. Please face the flag. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=69)|
| 0:01:27| I also want to welcome everybody who's with us tonight and anybody who might be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=87)|
| 0:01:33| watching us on CTV. Now we'll have the roll call. Councilman Campin. Councilwoman McKenzie. Here. Councilman Ryder. Here. Councilman Roberto. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=93)|

| 0:02:12| motion? Now on consent items 11E through F are certificates of compliance and 12G| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=132)|
| 0:02:20| as a 202. Move for approval. Second. We have a motion and a second. All in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=140)|
| 0:02:24| say aye. Aye. Any opposed? Consent items are approved. For the mayor's report, I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=144)|
| 0:02:31| to announce that first of all the new day space for people who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=151)|
| 0:02:35| experiencing homelessness opened today underneath Interstate 40 at Broadway. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=155)|
| 0:02:40| I want to update City Council and many compassionate people in Knoxville who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=160)|
| 0:02:44| have been following this project. This is the latest milestone as we continue to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=164)|
| 0:02:49| develop strategies for helping people get back on their feet and off the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=169)|
| 0:02:53| streets and into housing. We previously announced that the city would dedicate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=173)|
| 0:02:57| an additional $500,000 for several specific projects targeted to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=177)|
| 0:03:03| helping unsheltered people living and hanging out under the bridge. That| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=183)|
| 0:03:07| funding was added to the almost $1.4 million that the city will spend this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=187)|
| 0:03:12| fiscal year to address homelessness. It's what we spend, what we grant to other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=192)|
| 0:03:17| nonprofits and in the housing for homeless individuals that we also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=197)|
| 0:03:21| support. In addition, it's important to remember that there's another $1.3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=201)|
| 0:03:26| million in federal continuum of care funds that are allocated and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=206)|
| 0:03:30| nonprofit service providers each have their own privately raised funds and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=210)|
| 0:03:34| funds from various sources. That really adds up to tens of millions of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=214)|
| 0:03:38| dollars actually that are funded, that are spent each year in this community to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=218)|
| 0:03:42| work with those who need help to get back into housing and to get their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=222)|
| 0:03:47| life back together. We often lose sight of this larger pot that as we deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=227)|
| 0:03:52| one project at a time, we lose sight that there's a much larger pot of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=232)|
| 0:03:56| that really go from various sources to address our neighbors who are homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=236)|
| 0:04:01| So our approach to this particular project is multifaceted because our goal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=241)|
| 0:04:08| is to offer lifelines to people who are experiencing many different types of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=248)|
| 0:04:12| distress. Some of the funds that were allocated, some funds were allocated to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=252)|
| 0:04:16| volunteer ministry center to hire two social workers. Those social workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=256)|
| 0:04:21| have been reaching out directly to chronically homeless people who have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=261)|
| 0:04:24| been resistant to or otherwise have had difficulty connecting to and receiving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=264)|
| 0:04:29| services, shelter and housing. Another social worker with Helen Ross McNabb is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=269)|
| 0:04:35| focused on outreach to sex workers in that area, helping them to connect with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=275)|
| 0:04:39| social services and housing so they can make better choices and have the power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=279)|
| 0:04:43| to change their circumstances. I met recently with these three social workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=283)|
| 0:04:48| to learn about their experiences to date. They were each very positive about their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=288)|
| 0:04:53| work and the progress that they are seeing thus far. It's hard work, to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=293)|
| 0:04:57| clear, because each individual with whom they engage has their own story, their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=297)|
| 0:05:03| own history, their own story, their own challenges. There are no quick and easy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=303)|
| 0:05:08| solutions. But I feel good about the work of these social workers thus far and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=308)|
| 0:05:13| potential to move more people from homelessness to housing and better lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=313)|
| 0:05:18| We also created a new multi-agency coordinated intake assessment and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=318)|
| 0:05:24| referral system for housing. That's a mouthful. It's called the Coordinated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=324)|
| 0:05:28| Housing Assessment and Match Plan, or CHAMP, so it can be easily said. This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=328)|
| 0:05:34| system is used to identify the circumstances and needs of each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=334)|
| 0:05:38| individual and family, to refer them to the most appropriate housing and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=338)|
| 0:05:43| resources, and to prioritize the most vulnerable cases so we can address and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=343)|
| 0:05:48| try to help them first. There is a coordinator of CHAMP, and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=348)|
| 0:05:52| coordinator convenes a weekly case coordination meeting of housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=352)|
| 0:05:56| providers and case managers from about ten different agencies, where they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=356)|
| 0:06:01| discuss the cases of the most, so they actually go through one by one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=361)|
| 0:06:06| cases that they have in front of them, where they identify the most vulnerable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=366)|
| 0:06:10| and the highest priority individuals and families in order to help them get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=370)|
| 0:06:14| appropriate affordable housing as quickly as possible. And finally, we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=374)|
| 0:06:19| worked with service providers to create this improved day space for homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=379)|
| 0:06:22| individuals at Broadway underneath I-40. This new day space provides portable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=382)|
| 0:06:28| toilets, tables, furniture, tables and seating, access to water, and access to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=388)|
| 0:06:35| electricity so people can charge their cell phones. A private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=395)|
| 0:06:41| security company will open the gate in the morning, maintain general order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=401)|
| 0:06:45| during the day, enclose the area, and lock the gate at night. When problems, or if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=405)|
| 0:06:50| problems arise, they will work closely with Knoxville Police Department, who has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=410)|
| 0:06:54| always been a part of helping us serve the people there, and will continue to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=414)|
| 0:06:59| Our public service crews will go in and clean the space every night. This space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=419)|
| 0:07:04| is available for people who feel they have nowhere else to go. It is a place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=424)|
| 0:07:09| where social workers and service providers are interacting. They've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=429)|
| 0:07:13| already been interacting with them prior to this and will continue to interact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=433)|
| 0:07:17| with them and invite them to take advantage of the multiple services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=437)|
| 0:07:20| multiple services that are offered in our city. Our intent is that this space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=440)|
| 0:07:25| serves as a temporary stop on the way to permanent housing and a better life. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=445)|
| 0:07:32| are working closely with CARM, the Salvation Army, and Volunteer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=452)|
| 0:07:36| Ministry Center and other service providers to make it easier for people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=456)|
| 0:07:40| to access the wealth of services, shelter, and permanent housing resources already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=460)|
| 0:07:46| existing here for them. This is a long process, but we are seeing progress, little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=466)|
| 0:07:52| by little, as more individuals are choosing to engage with us. So we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=472)|
| 0:07:56| continue to track those outcomes and keep Council informed about this and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=476)|
| 0:08:01| community. And I want to thank Council for standing with us on this, for working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=481)|
| 0:08:07| with me, the City's Office on Homelessness, and all of our partners and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=487)|
| 0:08:10| faith leaders as we move forward to continue to provide these services and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=490)|
| 0:08:15| try to fill the gaps that are there so that we can better serve people who live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=495)|
| 0:08:20| in our community. We remain committed to our primary goal of helping every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=500)|
| 0:08:24| individual and family find an appropriate, affordable, and permanent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=504)|
| 0:08:29| place to live. So next I want to talk about last night. We had a large crowd on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=509)|
| 0:08:36| Market Square to celebrate Hanukkah in the city with our Jewish friends and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=516)|
| 0:08:40| neighbors. Hanukkah is called the Festival of Lights and it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=520)|
| 0:08:44| heartwarming that people of all faiths gathered in unity last night on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=524)|
| 0:08:49| square. In the face of that terrible tragedy that we're all aware of, a few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=529)|
| 0:08:53| weeks ago in Pittsburgh where a gunman killed 11 people at the Tree of Life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=533)|
| 0:08:57| Synagogue, Knoxville came together to celebrate the triumph of light over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=537)|
| 0:09:02| darkness. In light there is hope and the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah represents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=542)|
| 0:09:07| the triumph of freedom over oppression and of light over darkness. We all have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=547)|
| 0:09:12| say, those of us who were there, I think we all did feel very uplifted and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=552)|
| 0:09:17| energized as the menorah was lit at the Hanukkah in the City celebration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=557)|
| 0:09:21| Meanwhile, other Christmas in the City events are in full swing. People are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=561)|
| 0:09:26| coming downtown in big numbers to shop, ice skate on Market Square, and enjoy the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=566)|
| 0:09:31| holiday lights. There are performances, elf-on-the-shelf scavenger hunts, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=571)|
| 0:09:36| special peppermint trail dining and drinking specials. Lots of things going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=576)|
| 0:09:39| on down there. So if you want to know more about it, please visit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=579)|
| 0:09:43| KnoxvilleTN.gov slash Christmas for complete details, but there are three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=583)|

| 0:10:27| kids may have been there with school programs, but the miniature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=627)|
| 0:10:32| city is at 165 South Concord Street. Safety City will be decked out in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=632)|
| 0:10:37| holiday lights and decorations, and there will be games, crafts, and music. So we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=637)|

| 0:11:09| bikes and don holiday lights. It's quite something to see if you haven't seen it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=669)|
| 0:11:13| before. And the ride leaves at 730 p.m. from Market Square in Crouch Park. Next,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=673)|
| 0:11:20| it is my pleasure to recognize a group of special city employees tonight. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=680)|

| 0:11:48| Daniel Alexander, Recreation Specialist for the City's Parks and Recreation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=708)|
| 0:11:53| Department. Why don't you come on down so we can see a little better. He is the second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=713)|
| 0:11:58| recipient of the award which was established in 2017. Daniel was honored| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=718)|
| 0:12:04| for creating new dynamic recreation programs that include people with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=724)|
| 0:12:08| disabilities and involve multiple city departments and community partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=728)|
| 0:12:12| These programs have helped to reinvent the NSKIPP-Norwood Recreation Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=732)|
| 0:12:18| from a standard recreation center into a specialized hub for accessible sports. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=738)|
| 0:12:25| Daniel, we're recognizing Daniel is the Employee of the Year and now we want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=745)|
| 0:12:31| have you stay there, Daniel, so we can look at you some more. But we're also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=751)|
| 0:12:37| going to recognize the other finalists, the other folks who were finalists with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=757)|
| 0:12:41| you. And we ask all, please hold your applause to the end so we get everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=761)|
| 0:12:45| standing up. But let me tell you this, the Employee of the Year program was created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=765)|
| 0:12:50| for non-uniformed city employees by the City Ambassadors, which is an internal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=770)|
| 0:12:55| group of staff representatives from multiple departments that focuses on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=775)|
| 0:13:00| customer service and employee engagement. And the police and fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=780)|
| 0:13:05| departments, they're not included here because they already have their own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=785)|
| 0:13:08| employee recognition programs, which I'm always honored to go and be a part of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=788)|
| 0:13:13| So for each of the non-uniformed departments, they can nominate one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=793)|
| 0:13:19| employee to be considered for Employee of the Year and then a review panel of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=799)|
| 0:13:23| City Ambassadors. So it's not me, it's not those of us around here select, but city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=803)|
| 0:13:29| employees, city ambassadors who actually select the overall nominee and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=809)|
| 0:13:34| who selected Daniel this year. So again, this year, Daniel Alexander was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=814)|
| 0:13:39| Employee of the Year. And the others who were nominated, who were one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=819)|
| 0:13:44| finalists are, and please stand when I call your name, Tracy Berry, Plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=824)|

| 0:13:59| departments. Miranda Bonas, I had it right first time, in Fleet. Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=839)|

| 0:14:34| Penny is presenting at a conference for government procurement professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=874)|
| 0:14:38| and could not be here tonight, so we will recognize her in her absence. Larry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=878)|
| 0:14:43| Spencer from Public Service. Thank you, Larry. Katie Tanner from Employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=883)|
| 0:14:49| Benefits and Risk Management. Thank you, Katie, back there. And Scott Williams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=889)|
| 0:14:54| from Engineering. And now, let's give them all a big round of applause. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=894)|
| 0:14:59| you all so much. You set such a great example for all of us. We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=899)|
| 0:15:16| You want to say any words, Daniel? Go ahead. I'm just very humbled and honored| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=916)|
| 0:15:21| to be recognized for my work. And I look forward to creating more programs for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=921)|
| 0:15:26| persons with and without disabilities playing together. And I wouldn't be up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=926)|
| 0:15:31| here if it wasn't for the support of my colleagues and my supervisors. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=931)|
| 0:15:35| very much. Thank you so much, Daniel. So, lastly, Councilman Wallace brought to my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=935)|
| 0:15:39| attention that the Great Schools Partnership has some new information to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=939)|
| 0:15:43| share. And, of course, in her day job, night job and weekend job, it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=943)|
| 0:15:49| just a day job, Councilwoman Welch serves as president of Great Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=949)|
| 0:15:53| Partnership. So, today, we're going to call on the vice president of operations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=953)|
| 0:15:58| Cheryl Ball, to give us a brief update and to hand out copies, which I see we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=958)|
| 0:16:03| have, of the Great Schools Annual Report. Cheryl? Good evening. Thank you so much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=963)|
| 0:16:08| Mayor O'Hara and Council, for allowing me a few moments of your time. As the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=968)|
| 0:16:14| Research Development and Operational Partner with Knox County Schools, Great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=974)|
| 0:16:19| Schools Partnership has a number of initiatives that are highlighted in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=979)|
| 0:16:22| annual report that you have in front of you. Today, I want to specifically call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=982)|
| 0:16:27| your attention to pages two and three, which is about our community schools. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=987)|
| 0:16:32| community school strategy focuses on removing barriers that get in the way of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=992)|
| 0:16:37| student learning, utilizing public school facilities as a hub for convening and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=997)|
| 0:16:43| aligning community resources to more effectively support youth and families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1003)|
| 0:16:48| improve neighborhood health and safety, and positively impact student academic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1008)|
| 0:16:53| success. I have with me here today Tiffany Davidson and Adam Fritz. They are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1013)|
| 0:17:01| our two field supervisors that assist our team of 16 community schools site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1021)|
| 0:17:07| resource coordinators. I've seen them in action and they are really something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1027)|
| 0:17:11| They truly are. These resource coordinators are full-time employees of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1031)|
| 0:17:17| Great Schools Partnership and are housed directly in schools. Our team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1037)|
| 0:17:21| collaborates with more than 275 partners across our community to provide supports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1041)|
| 0:17:27| ranging from mental health services to after-school care, mentoring, dental care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1047)|
| 0:17:32| academic enrichment, English as a second language, meals for families, and the list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1052)|
| 0:17:38| just sort of goes on and on. But what's really important is that the specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1058)|
| 0:17:43| needs of each individual community school are different and fulfilled by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1063)|
| 0:17:49| the partners that are needed for that specific school. Most of the data that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1069)|
| 0:17:54| you see on page 3 is for the 2017-2018 school year and we're really pleased and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1074)|
| 0:18:01| excited to show that we have moved the needle. We were able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1081)|
| 0:18:07| address the gap in reading proficiency by 3.3 percent and math by 2.5 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1087)|
| 0:18:13| for community school students. It's a very exciting opportunity for us to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1093)|
| 0:18:18| that we are making a difference academically. For the 2018-19| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1098)|
| 0:18:23| school year, we've successfully expanded into three new community schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1103)|
| 0:18:28| Bell Morris Elementary, Spring Hill Elementary, and Whittlesprings Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1108)|
| 0:18:33| That brings the total number of community schools in the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1113)|
| 0:18:37| to 15 with one additional site being located outside of the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1117)|
| 0:18:42| We're serving 6,489 students across our city and are excited about the impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1122)|
| 0:18:48| our broad range of programming is having on students, families, school personnel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1128)|
| 0:18:54| and neighborhoods. The list of community schools is on page 3 and I would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1134)|
| 0:19:00| pleased to set up a visit if anyone is interested in coming out to see what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1140)|
| 0:19:05| community schools is all about. My business card is also attached so you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1145)|
| 0:19:09| can find me easily. But finally, I just want to say thank you so much for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1149)|
| 0:19:13| supporting Great Schools Partnership and the community school strategy. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1153)|
| 0:19:19| Thank you, Cheryl. This is truly an outstanding program, community schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1159)|
| 0:19:23| It's something that the city has invested in for many years, long before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1163)|
| 0:19:28| Councilwoman Welch came to City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1168)|
| 0:19:32| It's a program we'll continue to invest in. It's the great returns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1172)|
| 0:19:36| that we're seeing. Thank you. Thank you, Cheryl. Thank you, Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1176)|
| 0:19:41| I should also tell Council, when we were recognized the employees, we actually had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1181)|
| 0:19:46| a more formal recognition at the employee benefits luncheon and they all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1186)|
| 0:19:50| got awards and we had our pictures taken. That's why we didn't repeat that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1190)|
| 0:19:54| tonight. Okay, so that is the end of my report. Any council reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1194)|
| 0:20:00| Councilman Steyer. Thank you, Mayor. I just want to announce the Audit Committee is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1200)|
| 0:20:06| meeting next Thursday, December 13th at 530 up in the council office for all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1206)|
| 0:20:12| members and anyone else that's interested in attending. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1212)|
| 0:20:16| Thank you. Councilwoman McKenzie. Thank you, Mayor. Just a couple of announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1216)|
| 0:20:22| There will be an NAACP meeting this Thursday, December 6th from 12 to 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1222)|
| 0:20:27| I'll be speaking informal conversation regarding recode. That will be at Clinton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1227)|
| 0:20:33| Chapel AME Zion Church. Everyone is welcome to attend. Also on Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1233)|
| 0:20:37| December 13th from 6 to 7 p.m. there will be a community call to action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1237)|
| 0:20:41| meeting in Mechanicsville Lonsdale at the LT Ross building. That's at 2247| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1241)|
| 0:20:47| Western Avenue. The purpose of that meeting is similar to a call to action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1247)|
| 0:20:52| that we had in the Burlington community where we actually invited KPD to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1252)|
| 0:20:56| out and talk about community policing and safety tips. It also served as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1256)|
| 0:21:01| platform for the community to voice their concerns and to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1261)|
| 0:21:05| resources and connecting resources in the community. So we're just mirroring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1265)|
| 0:21:09| that in Mechanicsville Lonsdale. And it will culminate with a community outreach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1269)|
| 0:21:13| walk at various churches and prayer walks Sunday, December the 16th at 3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1273)|
| 0:21:18| o'clock. There will be one at Eternal Life Harvest that I will be participating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1278)|
| 0:21:22| in. I do want to thank everyone who actually helped coordinate the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1282)|
| 0:21:27| Burlington call to action meeting. It was attended by close to 100 people. Uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1287)|
| 0:21:32| so we definitely want to thank Captain Eve Thomas for their support. Also, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1292)|
| 0:21:38| Abbess Reed and her staff save our sons Kevin Perry and Tasha Harris for their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1298)|
| 0:21:42| assistance. Uh, Reverend Jerry Upton, Honey Rock Church, where the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1302)|
| 0:21:46| was held and then Word of Life Ministries. And then last but certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1306)|
| 0:21:50| not least, uh, everyone is invited to attend, uh, Cookies and Cocoa at East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1310)|
| 0:21:56| Tennessee PBS on Magnolia Avenue. It will be Sunday, December the ninth from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1316)|

| 0:22:06| a fun event. Cat in the Hat is actually there. There's Cookies Cocoa story| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1326)|

| 0:22:38| people out of preventing homelessness. So our next meeting in our last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1358)|
| 0:22:43| meeting, which is going to wrap up the conversations, is on December 14th from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1363)|

| 0:23:09| challenging time in our cities in our region's health care market, and this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1389)|
| 0:23:14| expansion will improve critical care services and employment opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1394)|
| 0:23:20| in our center city. The hospital also happens to be in a really great first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1400)|
| 0:23:25| district neighborhood, Historic Fort Sanders, and ensuring the health of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1405)|
| 0:23:30| that neighborhood is also a priority. Over the past year, the hospital has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1410)|
| 0:23:35| worked alongside Knox Heritage representatives from the Historic Fort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1415)|
| 0:23:39| Sanders neighborhood and city staff, and I'd particularly like to just give a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1419)|
| 0:23:44| shout out to Dr Bill Lyons, who really was so helpful through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1424)|
| 0:23:49| We met several times to achieve some pretty remarkable outcomes. Two historic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1429)|
| 0:23:55| homes have been moved and relocated and are now being restored within the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1435)|
| 0:24:00| Historic Fort Sanders neighborhood to allow additional residents to enjoy the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| neighborhood. And I spoke with the executive director of Knox Heritage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1445)|
| 0:24:11| Todd Morgan, who said that they're looking forward to marketing the house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1451)|
| 0:24:14| that they now own to professionals who will be able to then walk to work at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1454)|
| 0:24:20| the hospital. So that's an exciting opportunity. Um, the parking structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1460)|
| 0:24:26| that supports the hospital expansion meets design guidelines for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1466)|
| 0:24:31| conservation overlay. That was a very important priority for the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1471)|
| 0:24:35| in the surrounding residential homes, and there are additional opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1475)|
| 0:24:40| now. I think a kind of a new dialogue after some pretty challenging times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1480)|
| 0:24:45| between some of the parties. I think there are now additional opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1485)|
| 0:24:49| for partnership between the neighborhood, the hospital, Knox Heritage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1489)|
| 0:24:52| in the city. So I just wanted to let everybody know that that had happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1492)|
| 0:24:57| I also want to mention that Recode Knoxville held another stakeholder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1497)|
| 0:25:03| advisory committee meeting today. It was a half day workshop with really great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1503)|
| 0:25:08| interaction and dialogue around the residential portion of the code of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1508)|
| 0:25:13| proposed code. This is the second workshop. The first one focused on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1513)|
| 0:25:18| commercial and industrial sections of the code, and a number of community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1518)|
| 0:25:23| members have been present. I don't remember who was at the first workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1523)|
| 0:25:27| from Council, but I know that Vice Mayor Saunders was there at the workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1527)|
| 0:25:31| today. So thank you if you went to the first one as well. Another draft of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1531)|
| 0:25:36| ordinance is scheduled to be released. So mark your calendar on December 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1536)|
| 0:25:40| The process is continuing to move forward, and my understanding is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1540)|
| 0:25:45| MPC is at least scheduled to take Recode up at their December 13th meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1545)|
| 0:25:50| and it will be in their hands as to sort of how they handle that. So just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1550)|
| 0:25:57| keeping everybody updated. Thank you. Thank you. I would like to add you gave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1557)|
| 0:26:00| everybody credit for the Raise the Roof and the Fort Sanders, but we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1560)|
| 0:26:05| give you credit as well for all the work, all the leadership you showed and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1565)|
| 0:26:08| bring in all the parties together. We appreciate that very much. Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1568)|
| 0:26:12| Roberto. Thank you, Mayor. Um, as we discussed in the last council meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1572)|
| 0:26:17| we had a joint effort by city council members and county commission members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1577)|
| 0:26:22| to man a kettle to benefit the Salvation Army this past Friday. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1582)|
| 0:26:26| I'm happy to announce that our kettle had raised almost $500 and we were in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1586)|
| 0:26:32| the top five kettles. So that is just fantastic. I wanted to make sure I took| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1592)|
| 0:26:38| a moment and thanked council members Wallace, McKenzie and Campin for joining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| us. Also, county commission members Biggs, Jay and Gil and Chief Sharp for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1602)|
| 0:26:49| coming out for us as well. So we had a great time, and it was a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1609)|
| 0:26:53| opportunity. Thomas was there, too. Well, she was not there the day we did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1613)|
| 0:26:58| She does it every year. I know I called her one time and she was ringing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1618)|
| 0:27:03| bell when I had to call her for something. Thank you, Councilman. All| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1623)|
| 0:27:08| right. I think we're finished with reports, so we'll move on to elections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1628)|
| 0:27:11| and confirmations. 8A is a resolution expressing support to the mayor's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1631)|

| 0:27:56| Would you please stand? Thank you. And this is Nick St. Savoir. Is he here as well? I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1676)|
| 0:28:03| don't think he is here. Well, I want to thank you, Mr. Bridgman, for being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1683)|
| 0:28:06| willing to serve and for bringing your boss with you, Gabe Bolas. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1686)|

| 0:28:50| Move to approve. Second. Councilwoman Welch? Thank you, Mayor. I just wanted to maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1730)|
| 0:28:57| acknowledge some of the process that's gone into... Well, I have a question, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1737)|
| 0:29:03| guess. Let me start with my question. Mr. Hagerman, could you give us an update on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1743)|
| 0:29:07| where the city's sidewalk ordinance is and how it might relate to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1747)|
| 0:29:13| sidewalk study? Jim Hagerman, director of engineering for the city. We did a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1753)|
| 0:29:22| of development on that ordinance, but it got kind of backburnered as we got into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1762)|
| 0:29:29| the recode process, and we decided to put that off until after that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1769)|
| 0:29:37| all resolved. It relates, but kind of indirectly. The ordinance would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1777)|
| 0:29:44| require private developers to add sidewalk to their property. The study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1784)|
| 0:29:53| is more strategic, and it looks at where it is most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1793)|
| 0:30:00| valuable for the city to invest in new sidewalks, where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1800)|
| 0:30:06| connections are the most needed. And take a little bit of a step back. If we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1806)|
| 0:30:17| constructed sidewalks everywhere in the city on all streets, we would be looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1817)|
| 0:30:22| at at least two billion dollars worth of investment. So clearly we have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1822)|
| 0:30:27| prioritize, and this is a more formal process where we're going to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1827)|
| 0:30:35| to the public to get buy-in on our prioritization process and results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1835)|
| 0:30:41| And it should guide our new sidewalk construction for several years out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1841)|
| 0:30:49| But just back to the original part that you were starting to answer, was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1849)|
| 0:30:54| ordinance itself, we purposely said, let's go through recode, let's see where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1854)|
| 0:30:58| we are with recode and the way that is finalized, and then it'll be time to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1858)|
| 0:31:04| back and look at the sidewalk ordinance. And then, as he said, the sidewalk study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1864)|
| 0:31:08| will then, meanwhile we can move ahead with the sidewalk study, because that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1868)|
| 0:31:11| will allow us to look at, to determine what our priorities will be in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1871)|
| 0:31:16| future. You know, on what we value the most in terms of the factors that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1876)|
| 0:31:21| considered, and set up a plan for how to implement that throughout our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1881)|
| 0:31:28| Any other questions? Okay, so we have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1888)|
| 0:31:33| Aye. Any opposed? The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1893)|

| 0:32:26| ask maybe Chief Thomas or Mayor O'Hara, whoever feels more at it. There's been a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1946)|
| 0:32:32| couple of different events recently. There are symposiums that I haven't been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1952)|
| 0:32:37| able to attend that talk about addressing narcotics and the opioid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1957)|
| 0:32:40| crisis, and I just wondered what role this plays in that, and what component,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1960)|
| 0:32:45| what piece of the puzzle is this? This is actually for a drug-related death| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1965)|
| 0:32:51| task force, hard to say. So it involves multi-jurisdictional, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1971)|
| 0:32:56| involves a DEA agent, several investigators from our department, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1976)|
| 0:33:01| DA's office participates, as well as medical examiner's office. So this is one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1981)|
| 0:33:07| piece of the of the puzzle. There are several different efforts and different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1987)|
| 0:33:12| types of coalitions and task forces addressing different facets of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1992)|
| 0:33:16| whole opioid and narcotics drug issue, addiction issues, and this is one piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=1996)|
| 0:33:22| of it that's focused on drug-related deaths. Okay. Okay, so we have a motion and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2002)|

| 0:36:39| you regarding a social media meme but that's why I'm here. I saw on Facebook a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2199)|
| 0:36:45| meme regarding the Pier 865 project that you approved last last session. It was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2205)|
| 0:36:51| it's an unreliable source so I did some background checks. The essential message| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2211)|
| 0:36:56| of the meme was simply that the project you approved is not an original it's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2216)|
| 0:37:01| duplicate and that you had been duped. So I did I did some background checking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2221)|
| 0:37:08| I'm not sure that's completely true but it sure there there does look like some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| concerns that I think you need to address and I've included a quote on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2232)|
| 0:37:18| your handout and I'll just read it here from Lisa Zenni of the Public Arts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2238)|
| 0:37:21| Committee. This is what she said to you last week. This design is amazing you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2241)|
| 0:37:25| can't really tell from the pictures but the design of the piece itself reflects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2245)|
| 0:37:29| the topography the mountains of our region. When we asked the artist to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2249)|
| 0:37:33| explain where you where did you get the inspiration I was blown away because he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2253)|
| 0:37:38| could say well here is the Smoky Mountains. You can look here and there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2258)|
| 0:37:42| Mead's Quarry. If you really look long enough you can see parts of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2262)|
| 0:37:45| Tennessee River going through here close quote. So that that in all reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2265)|
| 0:37:54| considerations led you to believe that this was a unique piece of art. So I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2274)|
| 0:37:59| took that the images supplied by the artist did a reverse Google image| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| search and it does show very strong similarities to a piece of art that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2282)|
| 0:38:07| approved for Texas Tech University in 2016. I was able to verify that on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2287)|
| 0:38:12| several different sources. You have one of those here but I can't say that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2292)|
| 0:38:18| are the exact same piece of art. So they this this may be a very explainable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2298)|
| 0:38:26| reasonable similarity. So here's I I'd like to point out that you made a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2306)|
| 0:38:34| prescient and very smart move by structuring the allocations of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2314)|
| 0:38:38| funds in stages. So I know you've already approved one stage of that so before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2318)|
| 0:38:43| go to the next stage of funds I'd like you to verify that this is a unique| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2323)|
| 0:38:47| design. I can see the pictures they look similar they may be they may be unique| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2327)|
| 0:38:51| they may be some variation on the same theme that I can't discern from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2331)|
| 0:38:56| pictures but I'd like to make you to make sure that this is unique design. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2336)|
| 0:39:01| if it is a unique design the second thing I ask is you you get an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2341)|
| 0:39:04| acknowledgement from the artist of why they are so similar. I'm not an artist I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2344)|
| 0:39:10| can't draw stick figures to save my life. I can perfectly understand why these may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2350)|
| 0:39:15| have similarities and may be part of a series but I think you do you need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2355)|
| 0:39:19| know that it is part of a series if that is true. The third and last thing I'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2359)|
| 0:39:25| like you to make sure of is why we're spending $900,000 and Texas Tech| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2365)|
| 0:39:32| University was quoted $270,000 for the same or a very similar project. That may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2372)|
| 0:39:38| be a very reasonable cost breakdown it may not include the landscaping I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2378)|
| 0:39:43| know why the price different what the price difference is but it's striking on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2383)|
| 0:39:47| first glance. So yes at the next stage when this goes through I'd simply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2387)|
| 0:39:53| dislike you to verify these things and get some clarification on why why they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2393)|
| 0:39:58| are similar. Thank you. Thank you. Just for counsel's sake, Councilwoman Ryder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2398)|
| 0:40:02| has already requested information from Lisa Zinney which she has responded on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2402)|
| 0:40:08| and if you all are copied on that we'll be sure to forward all of it to you. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2408)|
| 0:40:12| can send it to Will. Yeah that'd be fine. Okay so you send it to Will, right. I will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2412)|
| 0:40:20| say just from the beginning part of her email, Dear Lorne, please see the artist's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2420)|
| 0:40:26| response below. He is correct in that we only asked him for a proposal and not a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2426)|
| 0:40:31| fully developed firm design. Each artist has a look that we recognize from one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2431)|
| 0:40:35| piece to the next. Think of Richard Dali, Picasso, Monet, and Gary. We all know them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2435)|
| 0:40:41| when we see them that does not take away from the artistic value of their work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2441)|
| 0:40:44| but she will follow up with that and with all of us. Okay. Thank You Mr. Brett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2444)|
| 0:40:49| Okay next is Barbara Bridges. Is Miss Bridges here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2449)|
| 0:41:00| Thank You Miss Bridges. Please state your name and address for the record and if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2460)|
| 0:41:04| you watch the timer you'll have up to five minutes. Barbara Bridges, 4536| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2464)|
| 0:41:09| Everwood Oak. I'm here tonight to first of all express my condolences to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2469)|
| 0:41:17| family of Sierra McCauley who was a young woman who was shot and killed by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2477)|
| 0:41:24| a Knoxville police officer last week in the middle of a mental health crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2484)|
| 0:41:32| There's nothing that any of you or the city or the police department or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2492)|
| 0:41:38| community can do to bring her back. All right. There's nothing that any of us can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2498)|
| 0:41:48| do to make her family or her loved ones or the community whole again. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2508)|
| 0:41:54| Sierra McCauley is gone from this earth forever and that's a profound thing and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2514)|
| 0:42:02| I wanted to speak to you about your responsibilities in this incident going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2522)|
| 0:42:09| forward. I don't envy you being a sitting mayor or a council person. It's probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2529)|
| 0:42:17| one of the worst case scenarios for this to happen on your watch but there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2537)|
| 0:42:23| some pitfalls that elected officials often fall into when these incidents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2543)|
| 0:42:29| occur and I wanted to warn you against those, some of them. The first is to think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2549)|
| 0:42:35| that more technology, body cameras, dashboard cameras, other technological| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2555)|
| 0:42:42| devices are a solution to the problem. Okay. I could give you a long list of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2562)|
| 0:42:48| incidents in which color of law violations have taken place and there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2568)|
| 0:42:54| no video evidence because the video was malfunctioning or the police officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2574)|
| 0:43:00| just turned it off. So I would avoid you against thinking that there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2580)|
| 0:43:04| technological solution. I would also avoid you thinking that more training is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2584)|
| 0:43:12| the answer. Okay. This was not a rookie cop. This was a seasoned veteran of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2592)|
| 0:43:22| police force who was decorated and if anybody on the police force should have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2602)|
| 0:43:28| known how to handle that situation in a way that didn't endanger anyone, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2608)|
| 0:43:35| would have been him. So more training is a common response but it's inadequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2615)|
| 0:43:43| It's also, so the question remains, what would justice for Sierra McCauley look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2623)|
| 0:43:53| like? First of all, there has to be an investigation and it's your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2633)|
| 0:44:01| responsibility as city council people, a responsibility that you cannot abdicate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2641)|
| 0:44:05| to make sure that that investigation is open and transparent and that all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2645)|
| 0:44:10| information that you could possibly share with the public is shared. Right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2650)|
| 0:44:15| now we don't even know what Sierra McCauley looked like. Was she an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2655)|
| 0:44:20| African-American woman? Was she homeless? We don't know anything and there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2660)|
| 0:44:25| hasn't been anything in the press for the past four days, which is concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2665)|
| 0:44:32| You could tell us today, right now, if she was an African-American woman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2672)|
| 0:44:42| If there is any video, you should release it. One thing we do know is that there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2682)|
| 0:44:48| probably audio of the 911 call. There's probably audio of the dispatch calling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2688)|
| 0:44:54| officers to the scene. Those audio tapes should be made available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2694)|
| 0:45:02| There also needs to be accountability. First of all, for the officer, if the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2702)|
| 0:45:07| investigation shows that there was a color of law violation, then he needs to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2707)|
| 0:45:12| be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the laws as any of us would be in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2712)|
| 0:45:17| situation. There needs to be accountability for the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2717)|
| 0:45:22| to get to the bottom of why this happened. Please don't think that it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2722)|
| 0:45:27| not a systemic problem. We know that nationwide this is a systemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2727)|
| 0:45:34| problem of people who are mentally ill being shot and killed by the police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2734)|
| 0:45:38| because police are first responders in situations when it would be better to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2738)|
| 0:45:43| have some kind of a trained health professional on the scene. Your job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2743)|
| 0:45:51| as council people, as elected officials, goes even beyond that. Accountability in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2751)|
| 0:45:57| those terms means directing resources away from the police into preventative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2757)|
| 0:46:03| measures that will make sure that this thing never happens again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2763)|
| 0:46:07| Thank you, Ms. Bridges. The next speaker is Sarah Hensley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2767)|
| 0:46:12| Ms. Hensley, is Sarah Hensley here? Yes. Thank you, ma'am, for being here. Please state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2772)|

| 0:46:30| Hensley and my address is 716 East Columbia Avenue. I have a packet for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2790)|
| 0:46:48| My goal for you this evening is the very beginning of a long-term effort toward lasting change in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2808)|
| 0:47:01| regard to the welfare of domesticated animals in Knoxville. That's my concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2821)|
| 0:47:06| tonight. My goal tonight is to open a dialogue about this issue and to shed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2826)|
| 0:47:13| light on this long-lasting, sorry, this long-standing problem in Knoxville. My| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2833)|
| 0:47:20| ultimate goal is to raise the standard of city ordinances. My understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2840)|
| 0:47:25| through the intense research that I have done in a short period of time over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2845)|
| 0:47:32| last week is that city ordinances are one source of the problem. They seem to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2852)|
| 0:47:41| be too restrictive in some places and not restrictive enough in others and to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2861)|
| 0:47:47| the point that they sometimes undermine the authority of animal control. My| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2867)|
| 0:47:54| ultimate goal is to raise standards of city ordinances in a sustainable way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2874)|
| 0:48:01| while maintaining short-term relief for the animals presently suffering in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2881)|
| 0:48:06| meantime. Sustainable meaning I would like to keep the burden, the financial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2886)|
| 0:48:14| burden off of the city by exploring collaborative and charitable options for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2894)|
| 0:48:23| a very long time before I turn toward trying to get money out of the city. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2903)|
| 0:48:29| talked a lot about a lot of things that need money tonight so I'd like to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2909)|
| 0:48:35| how far I can go with collaboration between entities that exist in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2915)|
| 0:48:39| people's charity. I've been given donations in the form of bedding, houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2919)|
| 0:48:47| insulation, food, treats, all kinds of things to give out to animals that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2927)|
| 0:48:51| kept outside year-round in all kinds of extreme weather and I have given these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2931)|
| 0:48:58| to animal control. So to this end I have reached out to animal control, codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2938)|
| 0:49:06| enforcement, Young-Williams Animal Center and the Humane Society of the Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2946)|
| 0:49:10| Valley along with a number of other private and private rescues and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2950)|
| 0:49:15| organizations. Mr. Moyer at codes enforcement referred me to Tracy Berry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2955)|
| 0:49:20| actually who was one of the people honored tonight. She totally deserves it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2960)|
| 0:49:26| based on my meeting the other day and she gave invaluable insight as to some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2966)|
| 0:49:33| questions, she posited some questions and said I don't have the answers but here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2973)|
| 0:49:38| are some, here's a way to articulate some questions that you may or may not have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2978)|
| 0:49:44| She has 12 years of experience in animal control and four in codes enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2984)|
| 0:49:49| Those are two very relevant entities in this in regard to this. As far as animal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2989)|
| 0:49:58| control goes, Supervisor Hogue and Officer Kelly met with me this morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=2998)|
| 0:50:04| and they gave me some incredible ideas and I also want to note that through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=3004)|
| 0:50:13| this exploration that I've been doing in research I've noticed that everyone is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=3013)|
| 0:50:18| totally human and trying their best. I think that as far as animal control goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=3018)|
| 0:50:24| I think I've found maybe the heart of the problem. It seems that they're again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=3024)|
| 0:50:29| their authority is undermined a lot of times. It seems there's a major gap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=3029)|
| 0:50:34| between city ordinance and what they can and can't enforce and state law. State| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=3034)|
| 0:50:40| law is very severe in relation to this kind of thing. So there's a major gap to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=3040)|
| 0:50:46| explore, a major gap to try to close. I'm reminded of a quote by Max Weber that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=3046)|
| 0:50:54| I'm going to get wrong but it's basically, politics is the strong and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=3054)|
| 0:51:00| slow boring of hardwood. So I don't expect major huge change very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=3060)|
| 0:51:06| I'm just trying to open a dialogue. Thank you so much. Oh I'm sorry in regard to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=3066)|
| 0:51:13| the packet that I just passed out, section 5.3 citations as far as what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=3073)|
| 0:51:19| they can actually enforce. That is something that I wanted to bring to your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=3079)|
| 0:51:23| attention. Section 5.8 the restraint of animals, the tethering and section 5.23| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=3083)|
| 0:51:31| cruelty to animals. Thank you and I would encourage you afterwards talk to our law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=3091)|
| 0:51:37| director Mr. Swanson. You were right to go to the animal control board. They can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=3097)|
| 0:51:41| explain kind of the process and where there's state law involved and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=3101)|
| 0:51:44| really need to talk to legislators. But continuing to talk to animal control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=3104)|
| 0:51:50| board and identifying some of these issues is really the right place to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=3110)|
| 0:51:53| start. So thank you for that. I also wanted to add to Ms. Bridges, if you want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=3113)|
| 0:51:57| you know Chief Thomas, this isn't a give-and-take you know a discussion time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=3117)|
| 0:52:02| for public forum, but Chief Thomas can explain to you that the process that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=3122)|
| 0:52:06| already in place on how we address officer involved shootings like that. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=3126)|
| 0:52:10| so she would be glad to fill you in after the meeting on that. Okay, thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=3130)|
| 0:52:15| you. Okay council that is the end of our agenda. If there's no further business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=3135)|
| 0:52:20| then we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilR265181204?start=3140)|
