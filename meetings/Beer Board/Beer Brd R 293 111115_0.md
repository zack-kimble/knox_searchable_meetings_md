| 0:08:27| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=507)|
| 0:08:28| I did send the owner a letter asking that he contact me and ask, you know, tell me what his intentions were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=508)|
| 0:08:35| I received nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=515)|
| 0:08:36| I did send an e-mail yesterday and have not received a response to that either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=516)|
| 0:08:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=520)|

| 0:08:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=522)|
| 0:08:43| I tried to call yesterday since the gentleman lives in my district and the former location had been in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=523)|
| 0:08:50| and I was not able to contact him at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=530)|
| 0:08:53| I do know that this location at 5210 Marguerite will not meet the fire code requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=533)|
| 0:09:00| and this would be another delay for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=540)|
| 0:09:04| And since he's not responded, I'm not real confident about his intensity in finding a new location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=544)|
| 0:09:13| What would be our options here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=553)|
| 0:09:15| I guess we could move to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=555)|
| 0:09:19| Move to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=559)|
| 0:09:20| Or we could simply let it die for lack of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=560)|
| 0:09:23| Or you could postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=563)|
| 0:09:28| Yes, I'm familiar with this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=568)|
| 0:09:30| It's actually in my district now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=570)|
| 0:09:32| Formally it was in Councilwoman Palmer's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=572)|
| 0:09:36| We've kind of been sharing responsibility on this because of the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=576)|

| 0:09:45| There's been some problems about code there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=585)|
| 0:09:48| It doesn't seem like there's much progress on him finding another location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=588)|
| 0:09:53| The applications for this address, but I just don't see much movement toward that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=593)|
| 0:09:57| Well, our options here are deny or do make no motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=597)|
| 0:10:01| It dies by that or, you know, defer it until another date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=601)|
| 0:10:09| Hearing no motion, it fails for lack of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=609)|
| 0:10:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=615)|

| 0:10:59| Does he have to wait a year or can he just reapply or what's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=659)|

| 0:12:55| Rogers, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=775)|
| 0:13:05| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=785)|
| 0:13:06| Jeff Lawhorn and Chris Patrick, 8807 Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=786)|
| 0:13:13| Mr. Patrick has not been in for background check and fingerprinting processing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=793)|
| 0:13:16| and they have not met the test class requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=796)|
| 0:13:21| Ms. Dunn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=801)|
| 0:13:22| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=802)|
| 0:13:23| I haven't taken the test class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=803)|
| 0:13:26| We need to surrender the former owner's permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=806)|
| 0:13:31| Mr. Patrick is signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=811)|
| 0:13:33| For Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=813)|
| 0:13:34| For this Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=814)|
| 0:13:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=818)|
| 0:13:39| I wonder if the applicant could explain, are you changing owners internally but keeping the name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=819)|
| 0:13:44| or is there some reorganization?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=824)|
| 0:13:47| Yes, we're changing ownership and keeping the name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=827)|
| 0:13:49| Rogers is a well-established hot dog stand in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=829)|
| 0:13:56| It's been around about 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=836)|
| 0:13:58| So that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=838)|
| 0:13:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=839)|
| 0:14:00| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=840)|
| 0:14:07| If he hasn't taken the course, is it scheduled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=847)|
| 0:14:09| Well, I mean, I think that's kind of, you know, this is, and I see Councilwoman Roddy's live here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=849)|
| 0:14:16| and I think I know where this is going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=856)|
| 0:14:19| But I mean, the question that I have is, number one, I mean, obviously we're not going to meet again until January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=859)|
| 0:14:26| But these boxes are not weighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=866)|
| 0:14:30| And, I mean, I've got to assume if, you know, if they're not done, they don't get a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=870)|
| 0:14:37| And when they are done, they get a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=877)|
| 0:14:40| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=880)|
| 0:14:41| You say we're not meeting until January?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=881)|
| 0:14:43| Well, regularly scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=883)|
| 0:14:44| I mean, I don't know what the first gentlemen are, but we moved the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=884)|
| 0:14:54| Well, Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=894)|
| 0:14:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=897)|
| 0:15:00| Speaking on behalf only of myself and not the entire beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=900)|
| 0:15:03| as this council's representative to the Metropolitan Drug Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=903)|
| 0:15:06| I'm particularly concerned about issues like the task class and coming in for fingerprinting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=906)|
| 0:15:12| and processing because of the effect that it has on the possible serving of underage youth in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=912)|
| 0:15:18| Although Chairman Pavlis said that these boxes are not weighted, for me personally they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=918)|
| 0:15:24| And these two issues are just immutable for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=924)|
| 0:15:27| It's incredibly important that our managers are trained well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=927)|
| 0:15:30| and that the servers that report to them and that are then trained by them understand the rules for serving beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=930)|
| 0:15:37| and, more importantly, how to effectively prevent the service of underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=937)|
| 0:15:42| We see time and time again, month after month, at this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=942)|
| 0:15:46| slip-ups that happen by very good people, but where training has not been sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=946)|
| 0:15:52| Folks can't see the licenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=952)|
| 0:15:54| It's too dark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=954)|
| 0:15:55| They forget to check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=955)|
| 0:15:56| They don't do the math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=956)|
| 0:15:58| I mean, it just goes on and on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=958)|
| 0:16:01| And Chairman Pavlis did offer a special beer board meeting to another applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=961)|
| 0:16:06| If that meeting is taking place, perhaps that's a situation where we could hear your permit as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=966)|
| 0:16:11| And know that these two very important boxes for me, the task class and the fingerprinting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=971)|
| 0:16:17| and processing with the Knoxville Police Department, have been achieved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=977)|
| 0:16:20| And I'll wait to hear from my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=980)|
| 0:16:30| Vice Mayor Boehner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=990)|
| 0:16:32| Mr. Patrick, you haven't been in for fingerprinting and processing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=992)|
| 0:16:35| I'm going in on Thursday morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=995)|
| 0:16:37| Do you have an appointment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=997)|
| 0:16:40| It's 930.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1000)|
| 0:16:41| It's supposed to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1001)|
| 0:16:42| And then you're scheduled to go to the task class, which is when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1002)|
| 0:16:46| Right after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1006)|
| 0:16:47| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1007)|
| 0:16:49| Well, here again, you know, since I've been on the council, we have put weight on different boxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1009)|
| 0:16:57| And the fingerprinting and process was one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1017)|
| 0:17:01| And then, of course, the task class, in my view, was the second one in line there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1021)|
| 0:17:07| However, I've always felt like, you know, when we say this move to approve pending final documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1027)|
| 0:17:15| that means that they will not get their license until they complete their check all the boxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1035)|
| 0:17:24| And, you know, how close, how important is it for this to happen now versus two weeks from today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1044)|
| 0:17:34| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1054)|
| 0:17:35| If you step up, please, and address yourself, I mean, identify yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1055)|
| 0:17:39| My name is Chris Patrick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1059)|
| 0:17:41| It's really important to us because we'd like to go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1061)|
| 0:17:43| Your address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1063)|
| 0:17:44| Your address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1064)|
| 0:17:46| 8707, Kingston, Ohio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1066)|
| 0:17:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1067)|
| 0:17:48| And it's kind of important to us because we'd like to go ahead and get everything transferred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1068)|
| 0:17:52| so we can go ahead and get all of our employees to be trained and follow through the steps that we should go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1072)|
| 0:17:58| But isn't there some sort of financial implication here, possibly, if you don't move forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1078)|
| 0:18:04| I mean, you're someone you mentioned to me earlier today that you had some real issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1084)|
| 0:18:10| that if you didn't go ahead and get this deal closed that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1090)|
| 0:18:15| within a week or so that you had some potential issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1095)|
| 0:18:18| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1098)|
| 0:18:19| We have a contractual situation with the prior owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1099)|
| 0:18:23| We have a closing deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1103)|
| 0:18:26| And I also want to point out that there are five members of this organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1106)|
| 0:18:33| and four of them have already been fingerprinted and background checked, including myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1113)|
| 0:18:40| And it was just unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1120)|
| 0:18:43| Chris was signed up last Thursday, and due to unforeseen circumstances, he missed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1123)|
| 0:18:48| So he was actually scheduled last Thursday and didn't make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1128)|
| 0:18:52| And it was just unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1132)|
| 0:18:56| But so he is signed up for this Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| So there are four of the five that have already, you know, submitted and gone through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1138)|
| 0:19:07| Counsel, one more comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1147)|
| 0:19:08| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1148)|
| 0:19:09| Mr. Chairman, earlier, you know, you were on the, I guess it was Clinton Highway grill and taps or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1149)|
| 0:19:17| I've forgotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1157)|
| 0:19:18| But you made the extra effort to move the people's business along, and I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1158)|
| 0:19:23| That's our job is to try to process these things in an orderly fashion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1163)|
| 0:19:27| and allow people to have commerce and business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1167)|
| 0:19:30| And, you know, I hate when a circumstance comes up like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1170)|
| 0:19:35| You know, I would be willing to make an exception, having said that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1175)|
| 0:19:39| until you complete the task class and go in for fingerprinting and processing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1179)|
| 0:19:43| you know, you're not going to get your permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1183)|
| 0:19:47| That would be our request, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1187)|
| 0:19:51| But I'll go ahead and hear my colleagues out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1193)|
| 0:19:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1194)|
| 0:19:55| I share Councilwoman Trotty's concern about having these things taken care of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1195)|
| 0:20:00| before you come to the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1200)|
| 0:20:02| I also understand that it's a long time until we have another beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1202)|
| 0:20:06| And since you are scheduled for the task class and the fingerprinting records check this Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1206)|
| 0:20:12| I would be willing to have them come back on December 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1212)|
| 0:20:17| That's the date and, you know, the five minutes to be sure that this is done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1217)|
| 0:20:22| or to go ahead and approve pending documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1222)|
| 0:20:27| Either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1227)|
| 0:20:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1229)|
| 0:20:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1231)|
| 0:20:33| Since this is in my district, I can see both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1233)|
| 0:20:36| I can see it from both directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1236)|
| 0:20:38| I really feel very strongly that we take our business here very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1238)|
| 0:20:43| And unless it's really some extenuating circumstance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1243)|
| 0:20:47| that someone can't fulfill the records and fulfill the needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1247)|
| 0:20:50| that I think that if we go ahead and have a special call meeting in two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1250)|
| 0:20:55| that we've certainly been over and done more than probably what we ought to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1255)|
| 0:20:59| And so if we could do it before our next council meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1259)|
| 0:21:02| I think we'd send out a much better message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1262)|
| 0:21:05| Because what I don't want to see is I don't want to see more of these coming before the beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1265)|
| 0:21:09| with people saying, well, I couldn't make it or whatever the situation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1269)|
| 0:21:13| And so if we could have a special postponement for a special call meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1273)|
| 0:21:17| as my colleagues have mentioned, then I'd be in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1277)|
| 0:21:21| Is that a choice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1281)|
| 0:21:22| Is that a choice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1282)|
| 0:21:23| Yes, sir, it's a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1283)|
| 0:21:24| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1284)|
| 0:21:25| I mean, we can go ahead and let's run the lights here and then we'll come back for a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| Please do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1289)|
| 0:21:30| I haven't made a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1290)|
| 0:21:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1291)|
| 0:21:32| I've always tried to be very consistent, but I'm willing to make the exception on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1292)|
| 0:21:37| I have a little closer understanding of who these folks are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1297)|
| 0:21:41| And so I'm going to make the motion to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1301)|
| 0:21:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1307)|
| 0:21:48| Do we want to hear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1308)|
| 0:21:50| I'm sorry, I didn't see the light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1310)|
| 0:21:52| We'll hold that motion and let's hear from Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1312)|
| 0:21:56| Well, I would agree with Councilman Bailey, Vice Mayor Bailey, that this particular case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1316)|
| 0:22:02| because they have indicated they're on a tight time schedule with their business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1322)|
| 0:22:08| I would be willing to approve this pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1328)|
| 0:22:12| I'll second his motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1332)|
| 0:22:14| Did you make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1334)|
| 0:22:16| I'll make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1336)|
| 0:22:17| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1337)|
| 0:22:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1338)|
| 0:22:19| Further discussion on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1339)|
| 0:22:21| Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1341)|
| 0:22:25| I respect what my colleagues have to say, but I really think that we really need to think hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1345)|
| 0:22:30| in terms of what our requirements are and what our expectations are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1350)|
| 0:22:34| We run into this, you know, as an architect, we run into this with building permits and things like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1354)|
| 0:22:39| that people say, well, I just couldn't get around to it or I didn't do it or I missed it or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1359)|
| 0:22:44| And, you know, the next time this comes up, you know, what are we going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1364)|
| 0:22:48| Are we going to do the same thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| And I think that we're making a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1370)|
| 0:22:52| And I think that what we are doing, though, is we are honoring them in some way by saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1372)|
| 0:22:57| come back in two weeks, have everything in order, and then we can approve it the way we should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1377)|
| 0:23:03| And I think that, as far as I'm concerned, I think it's a real mistake to go ahead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1383)|
| 0:23:08| especially on these two items, as has been talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1388)|
| 0:23:13| that to give someone a permit who has not been through the processing ordeal, I think is a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1393)|
| 0:23:21| And same thing, the task class is extremely important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1401)|
| 0:23:24| And even though they say, sure, they're going to take it Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1404)|
| 0:23:27| well, by the time you process, how long does it take from Thursday to then get the documentation to get the permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1407)|
| 0:23:33| I mean, it's two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1413)|
| 0:23:34| Are we talking five days, seven days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1414)|
| 0:23:36| What are we talking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| I can't speak for the documentation for the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1418)|
| 0:23:42| Just when they come in for the task class, we go ahead and while they're there at the class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1422)|
| 0:23:47| typically about noon, we fingerprint them, we do the background check right then and there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1427)|
| 0:23:52| Okay, and then once that's done, if everything's okay, then they take the class?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1432)|
| 0:23:57| Yeah, they're actually taking the class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1437)|
| 0:23:58| It's first come, first serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1438)|
| 0:24:00| We typically recommend people show up about 930 because the class starts at 10 and we only have space for 30 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1440)|
| 0:24:06| Is it always done on Thursdays?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1446)|
| 0:24:07| Yes, every Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1447)|
| 0:24:08| Everyone's notified ahead of time that Thursday, this is when you need to be here to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1448)|
| 0:24:12| I believe it's on the application or the paperwork that when they turn in their application to WANDA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1452)|
| 0:24:18| Yeah, I just think we're setting a precedent that is going to come back and bite us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1458)|
| 0:24:23| Councilwoman Rodd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1465)|
| 0:24:26| You know, this beer board going forward, I think, needs to always consider issues of fairness and consistency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1466)|
| 0:24:34| There are certainly going to be applicants that come in front of this board that some of us are familiar with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1474)|
| 0:24:39| and may know on a personal basis and there are always going to be applicants that none of us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1479)|
| 0:24:43| And it's certainly important in government and in public affairs that every applicant is treated the same and is treated equally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1483)|
| 0:24:50| And it's certainly my recollection that this board, when applicants have come in front of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1490)|
| 0:24:54| and they have not fulfilled the task class and the fingerprinting and background check,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1494)|
| 0:25:00| that those two issues have been incredibly important and that we have sent a message to all our applicants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1500)|
| 0:25:07| folks that we know, folks that we don't know, folks from all parts of town, that this is important to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1507)|
| 0:25:13| And Councilman Grieve has suggested a two-week postponement, which is not the 13th of December date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1513)|
| 0:25:19| It's the 29th of December date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1519)|
| 0:25:21| And with the Thanksgiving holidays in there, I'm sorry, the 29th of November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1521)|
| 0:25:26| And with the Thanksgiving holidays in there, I hope it will not be too punitive to this business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1526)|
| 0:25:31| They could have the opportunity to get these important issues taken care of and come back in front of this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1531)|
| 0:25:37| With a record and their affairs in order, and then we can go forward with a great deal of confidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1537)|
| 0:25:43| that alcohol in this establishment will be served responsibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1543)|
| 0:25:49| Vice Mayor Boehner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1549)|
| 0:25:50| Mr. Chairman, I'd just like to say that I respect my colleagues in your vote, especially when you articulate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1550)|
| 0:25:56| or you explain your vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| And I have been very consistent on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| I do believe, though, there are exceptions to the rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1560)|
| 0:26:04| And sometimes when there's a financial situation, circumstances, that maybe we could make an exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1564)|
| 0:26:11| So I've made the motion to approve pending final documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1571)|
| 0:26:17| which means until they complete these two, the glass and the fingerprinting, they will not get their permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1577)|
| 0:26:25| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1585)|
| 0:26:28| Mayor Bryan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1588)|
| 0:26:29| Councilman Grieve, did you make a motion on your suggestion or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1589)|
| 0:26:35| The chairman had said I was going to make a motion, but the chairman said, wait, there were other lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1595)|
| 0:26:40| And then he made a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| But I'd like to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1602)|
| 0:26:45| I'd like to make a motion that we postpone until the next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1605)|
| 0:26:49| That would be a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1609)|
| 0:26:53| Does it take precedent over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1613)|
| 0:26:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1614)|
| 0:26:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| I make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1618)|
| 0:26:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1619)|
| 0:27:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1623)|
| 0:27:04| That's a proper motion and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1624)|
| 0:27:06| All those in favor of the substitute motion, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1626)|
| 0:27:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1629)|
| 0:27:11| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1631)|
| 0:27:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1632)|
| 0:27:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1633)|
| 0:27:14| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1634)|
| 0:27:15| So we're back to a motion to the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1635)|
| 0:27:20| It was a motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1640)|
| 0:27:23| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1643)|
| 0:27:24| To November 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1644)|
| 0:27:25| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1645)|
| 0:27:26| To November 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| So we still have to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1647)|
| 0:27:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1648)|
| 0:27:29| We just voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1649)|
| 0:27:30| They just did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1650)|
| 0:27:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1651)|
| 0:27:32| I would really feel better if you did a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1654)|
| 0:27:35| Mr. Chairman, so the motion on the floor is to postpone, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1655)|
| 0:27:42| Voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1662)|
| 0:27:43| To a special call meeting on November the 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1663)|
| 0:27:52| I believe that would be okay with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1672)|
| 0:27:55| I think we can make that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1675)|
| 0:27:58| Where have you been?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| You saved us about 30 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1680)|
| 0:28:07| I just want you all to be happy and be friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1687)|
| 0:28:10| I think he came up from upstairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1690)|
| 0:28:14| Based on that, it's probably going to be a little bit different vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1694)|

| 0:28:22| Well, let's go ahead and do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1702)|
| 0:28:23| We did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1703)|
| 0:28:25| Let's go ahead and do a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1705)|
| 0:28:28| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1708)|
| 0:28:29| Is everybody clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1709)|
| 0:28:30| I mean, I kind of muddied the water, and I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1710)|
| 0:28:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1715)|
| 0:28:36| The substitute motion was to defer this until the November 29th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1716)|
| 0:28:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1722)|
| 0:28:43| Everybody's clear on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1723)|
| 0:28:44| For a special call beer board meeting prior to the council meeting on November 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1724)|
| 0:28:49| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1729)|
| 0:28:50| If you'll do a roll call vote, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1730)|

| 0:29:17| I gave him a limo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1757)|
| 0:29:18| May I ask, what do we have to do for the, quote, special call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1758)|

| 0:29:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1764)|
| 0:29:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1765)|
| 0:29:26| I also wanted to commend Wanda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1766)|
| 0:29:27| She is fantastic to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1767)|
| 0:29:28| She's always been fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1768)|
| 0:29:29| She is really cheerful and very, very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1769)|
| 0:29:30| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1770)|
| 0:29:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1771)|
| 0:29:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1772)|
| 0:29:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1773)|
| 0:29:34| So be here about, let's say, let's say 6.50, 6.50 on the 29th, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1774)|
| 0:29:57| See you then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1797)|
| 0:29:58| Mr. Chairman, I just want to say also, I appreciate your attitude and appreciate your understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1798)|
| 0:30:02| of how serious we take this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1802)|
| 0:30:04| And we know how serious you'll take it also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1804)|
| 0:30:07| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1807)|
| 0:30:08| We look forward to you opening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1808)|
| 0:30:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1809)|
| 0:30:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1810)|
| 0:30:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1811)|
| 0:30:12| That was easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1812)|
| 0:30:13| Next up is Smokey's Sports Pub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1813)|
| 0:30:18| It was deferred on December the 28th of 2010, January the 25th, March the 22nd, May the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1818)|
| 0:30:24| 17th, August the 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1824)|
| 0:30:27| There's a pattern here I'm detecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1827)|
| 0:30:31| Let me ask Wanda, if I might, since it's in the 4th District, I know this young lady| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1831)|
| 0:30:36| had trouble with the replacement lease running into a terrible fire code thing and the landlord| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1836)|
| 0:30:44| was not willing to put in a sprinkler system in that tank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| It looks like she's in a shopping center that has the same issue, although maybe it is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1848)|
| 0:30:54| forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1854)|
| 0:30:55| Can you tell us what you learned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1855)|
| 0:30:56| I mean, there's been a lot of postponements, like the Chairman said, and at some point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1856)|
| 0:31:00| we may have to end this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1860)|
| 0:31:04| What is the story, as you understand it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1864)|
| 0:31:05| We have emailed frequently, and she's just having a terrible time trying to find a location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1865)|
| 0:31:10| She has found a couple of places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1870)|
| 0:31:13| She'll get the building inspector to come out, and the health department will come out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1873)|
| 0:31:17| and inspect them, and they'll just be so, I guess, run down that she can't get them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1877)|
| 0:31:22| up to code, or the landlord's just not willing to help her do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1882)|
| 0:31:28| But I heard she was still trying to find a legitimate location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1888)|
| 0:31:31| Mr. Chairman, I wonder if I could ask a question of you or Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1891)|
| 0:31:37| Would it be possible to put this thing to rest, and if she finds a location, I could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1897)|
| 0:31:42| move to waive the fee or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1902)|
| 0:31:44| I really don't like the idea of keeping this open-ended without a schedule in place where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1904)|
| 0:31:49| we're making progress towards a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1909)|
| 0:31:52| Let me make this easy for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1912)|
| 0:31:55| I'm being informed there's already another business that is operating in this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1915)|
| 0:32:00| That's not a bar or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| So I don't know if that makes your decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1922)|
| 0:32:06| I don't know what you just told me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1926)|
| 0:32:08| I mean, she's just, you know, she's just hunting for a place at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1928)|
| 0:32:13| I mean, there's somebody already in the building where she was operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1933)|
| 0:32:18| Along those same lines, I have a question, and I guess this goes to you folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1938)|
| 0:32:24| Let's say I decide that I want to open a bar, but I have no idea where I want to open the bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1944)|
| 0:32:31| But it's going to be somewhere in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1951)|
| 0:32:33| So can I just come and apply for a beer permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| Or do I have to say it's going to be at Ms. Roddy's house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1956)|
| 0:32:41| And then I come and apply, but knowing that it won't be at Ms. Roddy's house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1961)|
| 0:32:46| I mean, is there any kind of way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1966)|
| 0:32:47| Everything is tied to the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1967)|
| 0:32:50| All the inspections are, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1970)|
| 0:32:51| Measurements, everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1971)|
| 0:32:52| Location, location, location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1972)|
| 0:32:53| But, I mean, so then I can come to you with a location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1973)|
| 0:32:57| I mean, how do we know whether these folks check these locations out to be sure that they can do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1977)|
| 0:33:01| Instead of being, this one's been on the books since last December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1981)|
| 0:33:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1985)|
| 0:33:06| And we keep advertising that same location, even though there is another business, as Mr. Pavlis said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1986)|
| 0:33:11| because that's the only location I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1991)|
| 0:33:14| Is that advertised every month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| Every time right before the beer board meeting, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1996)|
| 0:33:19| So have we already spent her fees that she paid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=1999)|
| 0:33:22| Probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2002)|
| 0:33:23| I think it's time to put it to sleep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2003)|
| 0:33:26| We've tried to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2006)|
| 0:33:27| And I know she ran into some bad luck, but we have really tried to accommodate her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2007)|
| 0:33:34| And I think she's just going to have to get a location and start over and do it the right way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2014)|
| 0:33:39| And this is the same circumstances as we had earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2019)|
| 0:33:43| There can be no motion, and it would die for a lack of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2023)|
| 0:33:46| And or we can just, you know, give it to death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2026)|
| 0:33:51| A no motion is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2031)|
| 0:33:52| A no motion is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2032)|
| 0:33:55| Councilman Grieve, is that an old light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2035)|
| 0:33:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| Seeing no other lights, and I'm going to say that I'm not hearing a motion to defer this any further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2040)|
| 0:34:07| I'll say that it's dead by a lack of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2047)|
| 0:34:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2052)|
| 0:34:13| Next up, let's see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2053)|
| 0:34:18| I believe we're to that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2058)|
| 0:34:22| Doodles, 5,000 Clinton Highway, they had asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2062)|
| 0:34:29| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| It was approved subject to final documentation August the 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2070)|
| 0:34:33| And I'm assuming you're Mr. Doodles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2073)|
| 0:34:36| Craig Cole, 5,000 Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2076)|
| 0:34:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| Do you need an extension, a further extension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2080)|
| 0:34:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2082)|
| 0:34:43| And how long would you like that extension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2083)|
| 0:34:46| Sixty days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2086)|
| 0:34:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2087)|
| 0:34:48| Is this in the fifth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2088)|
| 0:34:51| I think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2091)|
| 0:34:52| I'm not sure because this just came before me, but it's on Clinton Highway, so I would move for the extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2092)|
| 0:34:58| Sixty-day extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2098)|
| 0:34:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2099)|
| 0:35:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2100)|

| 0:35:03| I wonder if the gentleman wouldn't mind telling us, are you under construction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| What's actually happening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2106)|
| 0:35:07| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2107)|
| 0:35:08| We're having construction delays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2108)|
| 0:35:09| The previous people had been in there ten years, and the codes have changed so much in that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2109)|
| 0:35:16| And we just really were working hand-in-hand with the codes department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2116)|
| 0:35:20| Upgrade the building, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2120)|
| 0:35:21| Review and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2121)|

| 0:35:26| Like we have to put more fire exits and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2126)|
| 0:35:29| And the people upstairs, they're just absolutely great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2129)|
| 0:35:32| All the inspectors and reviews, drawing reviews and everything, they've really helped us out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2132)|
| 0:35:37| Thank you much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2137)|
| 0:35:38| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2138)|
| 0:35:39| I just want to ask them, how many people do you plan to employ there when you get up and running?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2139)|
| 0:35:46| Golly, we're going to be running, hopefully, 50 to 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2146)|

| 0:35:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2158)|
| 0:35:59| I would move for a 60-day extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2159)|
| 0:36:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2160)|
| 0:36:01| And there's been a second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2161)|
| 0:36:02| Seeing no, it's an old lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2162)|
| 0:36:05| Seeing no further light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2165)|
| 0:36:06| All those in favor of the 60-day extension say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2166)|

| 0:36:25| Tasha Matthews, 135 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2185)|
| 0:36:31| You were given a 120-day extension in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2191)|
| 0:36:36| And we sent another notice out on October the 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| And I'm assuming you're here for another extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2201)|
| 0:36:42| Unfortunately, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2202)|
| 0:36:43| I'm asking for a 90-day extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| 90-day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2205)|
| 0:36:46| And what's the circumstances there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2206)|
| 0:36:49| Being that it's a new concept, they've gone back and forth with contractors and just decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2209)|
| 0:36:56| And that's kind of put things behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| But they're in full motion now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2220)|
| 0:37:01| And I'm assuming that's the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| Well, I'm going to move for a 90-day extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2223)|
| 0:37:06| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| Seeing no lights, I'm going to assume we're going to defer for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2228)|
| 0:37:11| All those in favor of the deferral say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293111115?start=2233)|
