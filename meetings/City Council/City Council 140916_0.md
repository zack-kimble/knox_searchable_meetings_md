| 0:01:02| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=62)|

| 0:01:04| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=64)|
| 0:01:05| Okay, we are all here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=65)|
| 0:01:06| Is there a motion to approve the minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=66)|
| 0:01:07| I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=67)|
| 0:01:08| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=68)|
| 0:01:09| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=69)|
| 0:01:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=70)|
| 0:01:11| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=71)|
| 0:01:12| The minutes are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=72)|
| 0:01:14| Are there any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=74)|
| 0:01:18| Items for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=78)|
| 0:01:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=79)|
| 0:01:20| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=80)|
| 0:01:21| Madam Mayor, I would like to move that we table 12C and if you had gone to the council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=81)|
| 0:01:28| forum you would see that there is pending litigation that could have effect on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=88)|
| 0:01:35| ordinance, could actually make it obsolete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=95)|
| 0:01:42| So it's not going to be heard until November the 13th, so I think it's in my mind appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=102)|
| 0:01:49| that we put this off until that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=109)|
| 0:01:52| And the reason I am tabling it rather than postponing it is because the judge may or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=112)|
| 0:01:57| may not rule that day, I don't know what the protocol of that would be, but it could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=117)|
| 0:02:04| very well not be ruled on that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=124)|
| 0:02:06| So I don't want to put a date certain, I'm not burying it, people have a heartache sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=126)|
| 0:02:11| when they hear tabling it, but that's the reason being, so I'll make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=131)|
| 0:02:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=135)|
| 0:02:16| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=136)|
| 0:02:17| We have a motion and a second to table 12C, dealing with the child care zoning regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=137)|
| 0:02:24| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=144)|
| 0:02:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=145)|
| 0:02:27| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=147)|
| 0:02:28| That is tabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=148)|
| 0:02:30| Any other items for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=150)|
| 0:02:33| Items to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=153)|
| 0:02:35| Consent items 12N through NO are 202s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=155)|
| 0:02:39| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=159)|
| 0:02:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=160)|
| 0:02:41| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=161)|
| 0:02:42| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=162)|
| 0:02:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=163)|
| 0:02:44| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=164)|
| 0:02:45| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=165)|
| 0:02:46| For the mayor's report, first I understand that Councilman Saunders, you might have had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=166)|
| 0:02:51| a birthday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=171)|
| 0:02:53| Are you not celebrating birthdays anymore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=173)|
| 0:02:55| That's not yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=175)|
| 0:02:56| Oh, it's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=176)|
| 0:02:57| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=177)|
| 0:02:58| It's coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=178)|
| 0:02:59| Coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=179)|
| 0:03:00| In two days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=180)|
| 0:03:01| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=181)|
| 0:03:02| Two days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=182)|
| 0:03:03| Two days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=183)|
| 0:03:04| Well, I think we all wish you a very happy birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=184)|
| 0:03:06| We won't say how many years it is, but you're still very young.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=186)|
| 0:03:09| Very young.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=189)|
| 0:03:10| There will be Girl Scales escorting him to his seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=190)|
| 0:03:13| Well, happy birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=193)|
| 0:03:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=196)|
| 0:03:18| First I want to really thank everybody who was involved in the Medal of Honor Convention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=198)|
| 0:03:24| last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=204)|
| 0:03:26| I know Council was at many of those events and I was at several of them and every event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=206)|
| 0:03:32| I went to, the Medal of Honor recipients and the people, their family members who were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=212)|
| 0:03:38| of other Medal of Honor recipients who couldn't be there, who were deceased, it was a big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=218)|
| 0:03:43| crowd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=223)|
| 0:03:44| You know, we had about 48 Medal of Honor recipients in town, plus all the families and such, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=224)|
| 0:03:51| everybody I talked to said that Knoxville really outdid themselves, outdid ourselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=231)|
| 0:03:56| in throwing this convention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=236)|
| 0:03:58| They said we set a very high bar for future conventions, so Boston's got to be worried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=238)|
| 0:04:04| But it was just a real honor, I think, for any of us who had an opportunity to talk to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=244)|
| 0:04:08| those recipients or the family members and to learn their stories and hear what they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=248)|
| 0:04:13| did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=253)|
| 0:04:14| You know, the heroes that they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=254)|
| 0:04:16| And I'm not just saying that because I sat next to Mark Wahlberg at the gala on Saturday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=256)|
| 0:04:20| night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=260)|
| 0:04:21| I mean, it was a big event all around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=261)|
| 0:04:25| But anyway, I just again want to thank Joe Thompson, Chris Coyne, who are the co-chairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=265)|
| 0:04:30| of the committee, everybody, all the sponsors, there were a lot of sponsors from throughout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=270)|
| 0:04:35| our community, including Council, including the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=275)|
| 0:04:38| We put in a little bit of money to help make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=278)|
| 0:04:41| And I think we did ourselves proud and certainly it's something that the Medal of Honor recipients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=281)|
| 0:04:45| will remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=285)|
| 0:04:48| This Friday, I want to invite any Council members who can make it to ride a Cat Bus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=288)|
| 0:04:53| with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=293)|
| 0:04:55| I'm leaving from downtown out to Fountain City for lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=295)|
| 0:04:59| And we're starting a new initiative called The Mayor's On Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=299)|
| 0:05:03| And this is an idea brought to us by our new Transit Director, Dawn Disler, who's out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=303)|
| 0:05:08| somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=308)|
| 0:05:09| Yeah, we thought it was a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=309)|
| 0:05:12| She instituted this in Nashville with Mayor Carl Dean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=312)|
| 0:05:16| So every few months or so, as the opportunity arises, depending on the schedule for meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=316)|
| 0:05:23| I and staff and Dawn will take the bus out to that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=323)|
| 0:05:27| So this week, we have on Friday afternoon, we have a, we'll be recognizing the Patrol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=327)|
| 0:05:35| Unit of the Month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=335)|
| 0:05:36| And this time it's going to be at the Walker, what is the location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=336)|
| 0:05:42| Walker Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=342)|
| 0:05:43| Walker Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=343)|
| 0:05:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=344)|
| 0:05:45| At the, at our East District Precinct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=345)|
| 0:05:47| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=347)|

| 0:05:49| East District Precinct on Walker Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=349)|
| 0:05:52| So we're going to actually take the bus, we're going to catch the bus downtown, we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=352)|
| 0:05:56| to take it up Broadway to Littons, have lunch at Littons, and then we'll catch another bus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=356)|
| 0:06:01| and come down to, to Broadway at Mineral Springs and, or to Northgate Terrace, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=361)|
| 0:06:08| and then we'll get off and we'll walk over to the East, East, Knoxville, East District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=368)|
| 0:06:14| Precinct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=374)|
| 0:06:15| So if anybody wants to join us, I think it's going to be interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=375)|
| 0:06:19| What the whole purpose of this is to show that it really is easy to get around town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=379)|
| 0:06:23| to your meetings and such by riding the bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=383)|
| 0:06:27| And so we invite people to come out and join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=387)|
| 0:06:30| It also will give us an opportunity to people, to talk to people on the bus and see their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=390)|
| 0:06:34| experience and, and make sure that, that they meet Don and that they meet city staff and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=394)|
| 0:06:41| and we are there to listen to their concerns and their wishes for our transit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=401)|
| 0:06:45| Anyway, so I invite you all to come out and join me and the other 3.6 million passengers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=405)|
| 0:06:51| that CAT carries each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=411)|
| 0:06:53| Will we be singing 99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall when we go down there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=413)|
| 0:06:57| No, we will not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=417)|
| 0:06:59| If you want to do that, you'll catch another bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=419)|

| 0:07:07| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=427)|
| 0:07:08| Not everybody, but council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=428)|
| 0:07:11| I'm in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=431)|
| 0:07:16| Okay, next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=436)|
| 0:07:19| Next Monday, September 22nd, our Office of Redevelopment will hold a public meeting on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=439)|
| 0:07:25| brownfield assessment projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=445)|
| 0:07:27| This will be at the All Occasions Catering at 922 North Central Street at 5.30 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=447)|
| 0:07:35| again on Monday the 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=455)|
| 0:07:38| As you know, we had federal grant money through the Environmental Protection Agency to survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=458)|
| 0:07:43| former industrial sites in the downtown north and south waterfront redevelopment areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=463)|
| 0:07:48| Before there can be redevelopment on any of these sites, the old brownfield sites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=468)|
| 0:07:52| the owners need to know what's in the ground there and what kind of remediation needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=472)|
| 0:07:58| So at this meeting, our engineering and planning consultants will present the results of those studies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=478)|
| 0:08:05| of that project, and this is an important step towards continuing the investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=485)|
| 0:08:09| and redevelopment that we are seeing in both of these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=489)|
| 0:08:12| And if I'm not mistaken, this was done on Baptist Hospital and when the developers came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=492)|
| 0:08:17| We already had that assessment done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=497)|
| 0:08:18| It's a lot easier for a developer to decide whether to purchase a property if they already know what the risk might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=498)|
| 0:08:24| And so this is something that really, using this federal dollars, we're able to do that assessment ahead of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=504)|
| 0:08:31| gives the developers information they need to make a good call on whether or not to purchase that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=511)|
| 0:08:35| when they do what they're going to have to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=515)|
| 0:08:37| So it's really paying off for us in many ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=517)|
| 0:08:41| So speaking of Office of Redevelopment, we have some other good news,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=521)|
| 0:08:44| and so I'm going to invite Bob Wetzel, our redevelopment director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=524)|
| 0:08:48| and Ann Wallace, project manager, to come tell us about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=528)|
| 0:08:54| I guess Bob's going to let Ann do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=534)|
| 0:08:56| Go right ahead, Ann.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=536)|
| 0:08:57| I've been given the nod.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=537)|
| 0:08:59| Good evening, Mayor and members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=539)|
| 0:09:01| I'm coming with great news and want to offer, first and foremost, a thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=541)|
| 0:09:07| Part of our good news comes from the fact that you all voted to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=547)|
| 0:09:11| and approve the Cumberland Avenue form-based code and administrative section for our zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=551)|
| 0:09:18| And with that, I'd like to present to council and the mayor a 2014 Outstanding Planning Award| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=558)|
| 0:09:25| for a project or tool or program presented to the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=565)|
| 0:09:29| for the Cumberland Avenue form-based code and general provisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=569)|
| 0:09:32| by the Tennessee chapter of the American Planning Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=572)|
| 0:09:37| So this is a statewide award, and it was given to us by the TAPA organization last month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=577)|
| 0:09:44| at their annual conference in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=584)|
| 0:09:48| I was able to go and accept the award on behalf of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=588)|
| 0:09:51| It was very exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=591)|
| 0:09:52| There was a room full of folks there who certainly appreciate good planning and good codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=592)|
| 0:09:58| With that said, I must take a moment to thank all of the city departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=598)|
| 0:10:03| and other staff that worked on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=603)|
| 0:10:06| The city departments included the Office of Redevelopment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=606)|
| 0:10:09| engineering department, Jim Hagerman provided expertise on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=609)|
| 0:10:13| as well as several of his staff members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=613)|
| 0:10:15| The law department, including Charles Swanson and Krista Kukuro| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=615)|
| 0:10:19| and even Angela Halbury, which you might remember, left the city just a little while ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=619)|
| 0:10:24| We also had an extensive review process with our plans review and inspections department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=624)|
| 0:10:30| as well as the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=630)|
| 0:10:32| and two of the staff members who worked on that document are here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=632)|
| 0:10:35| Mark Donaldson, the executive director, and Mike Reynolds, one of the long-range planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=635)|
| 0:10:42| Sorry, Mike, I almost put you in the transportation group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=642)|
| 0:10:45| But with that said, we also worked with a great consultant, Code Studio, out of Austin, Texas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=645)|
| 0:10:50| and they did a fantastic job really breaking down a difficult assignment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=650)|
| 0:10:55| to help make form-based code accessible to the folks who would be impacted on Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=655)|
| 0:11:01| And some of the comments from the jurors who judged this project included,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=661)|
| 0:11:06| this is a great code update, I think the layout was easy to read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=666)|
| 0:11:09| and the graphics helped readers visualize the meaning of the words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=669)|
| 0:11:12| The allowed use table was concise and easy to interpret.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=672)|
| 0:11:16| The plan is very transferable and utilized a great process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=676)|
| 0:11:21| I have to say, I actually got a call from the city of Chattanooga last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=681)|
| 0:11:24| asking about our Cumberland Avenue form code, so it is actually being transferable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=684)|
| 0:11:29| and other folks are looking to it as a good model to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=689)|
| 0:11:32| And then finally, folks were very pleased to see that the code was adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=692)|
| 0:11:36| and that they really felt like it was a benefit to the corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=696)|
| 0:11:40| and set the stage for long-term investment in the area that will really be positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=700)|
| 0:11:45| So again, thanks to council members and to the mayor, also to Bill Lyons, our director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=705)|
| 0:11:51| and Christy Branscombe, the director of the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=711)|
| 0:11:55| I'm sorry, Christy, I'm getting tongue-tied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=715)|
| 0:11:58| Of our operations group who offered so much staff time to make this possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=718)|
| 0:12:02| So thanks, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=722)|
| 0:12:04| Thank you, and thanks to all who had a part in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=724)|
| 0:12:06| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=726)|
| 0:12:07| Applause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=727)|
| 0:12:12| Great work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=732)|
| 0:12:13| So while we're talking about Cumberland Avenue, there is yet another ribbon cutting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=733)|
| 0:12:18| Did you want to speak to any of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=738)|
| 0:12:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=739)|
| 0:12:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=740)|
| 0:12:21| So we're going to have the grand opening ceremony for University Commons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=741)|
| 0:12:25| You know, we've already had Publix open, Walmart open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=745)|
| 0:12:29| and now the entire development will have their official ribbon cutting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=749)|
| 0:12:33| So this is on next Thursday, September 25th at 11 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=753)|
| 0:12:39| Thursday, September 25th at 11 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=759)|
| 0:12:42| And if you've been out there, you've seen how popular University Commons is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=762)|
| 0:12:46| I know Bill has ridden the trolley several times, and Bill and Christy went out one time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=766)|
| 0:12:52| and the trolley's packed from downtown and people from downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=772)|
| 0:12:56| other parts of town that come in through the transfer station and transit station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=776)|
| 0:13:03| And anyway, there are a lot of folks taking the trolley there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=783)|
| 0:13:06| There are people walking from campus and from the fort over there, and, of course, cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=786)|
| 0:13:10| There's plenty of parking there under cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=790)|
| 0:13:12| So it's already there are a lot of folks that are using that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=792)|
| 0:13:15| And if you think back on what it looked like just a few years ago as that Baron Brownfield site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=795)|
| 0:13:21| this is another one where the assessment helped them, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=801)|
| 0:13:25| We had done the assessment on that property too, or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=805)|
| 0:13:28| Through a different program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=808)|
| 0:13:29| Through a different program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=809)|
| 0:13:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=810)|
| 0:13:31| So anyway, I encourage everybody to be out there on Thursday for that ribbon cutting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=811)|
| 0:13:36| And finally, if you have any doubts about the variety, vibrancy, and diversity of Knoxville culture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=816)|
| 0:13:42| the next few weeks has several events that will put that to rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=822)|
| 0:13:46| This Saturday, the 20th, we will see Knoxville's first ever Asian festival in Crouch Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=826)|
| 0:13:52| That same evening at 6.30, Centro Hispano will host the Latino Awards at the Convention Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=832)|
| 0:13:59| And then the following weekend, we see both the 35th annual Greek Fest at St. George Greek Orthodox Church on Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=839)|
| 0:14:07| which is always a lot of fun, and the 15th Ola Festival on Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=847)|
| 0:14:12| I think that's Saturday night and Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=852)|
| 0:14:15| So you can find the dates and times for all those events on their respective websites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=855)|
| 0:14:20| And I think you'll agree that what they all have in common is great food, music, dance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=860)|
| 0:14:27| and a great chance just to come out and enjoy what the people and diversity of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=867)|
| 0:14:31| So hopefully folks will join us there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=871)|
| 0:14:34| And that is the end of my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=874)|
| 0:14:35| Vice Mayor Cavanaugh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=875)|
| 0:14:36| That's a good report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=876)|
| 0:14:37| Yeah, I was just wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=877)|
| 0:14:38| A lot going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=878)|
| 0:14:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=879)|
| 0:14:40| To point out, I appreciated Councilman Finbar Saunders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=880)|
| 0:14:43| and the mayor being at the South Alliance event that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=883)|
| 0:14:48| Their first event, actually, at one of the crown jewels in South Knoxville at the Iams Nature Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=888)|
| 0:14:55| It started at 10 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=895)|
| 0:14:56| Debbie Sharp, the newest hire for the Department of Neighborhoods in South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=896)|
| 0:15:02| had a trek about two hours there at Iams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=902)|
| 0:15:06| And she has a monthly trek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=906)|
| 0:15:09| You can find in a trek south, I believe, on Facebook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=909)|
| 0:15:13| She hosts a hike somewhere in South Knoxville every week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=913)|
| 0:15:18| I'm hearing she may be taking it out of South Knoxville some, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=918)|
| 0:15:21| But anyway, the South Alliance is comprised of about over 50 businesses located in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=921)|
| 0:15:28| We all know what they've been through during the bridge closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=928)|
| 0:15:33| But they have really done a great job of staying together and helping each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=933)|
| 0:15:39| And it was a really nice event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=939)|
| 0:15:41| They had three bands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=941)|
| 0:15:42| They had vendors set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=942)|
| 0:15:44| They had food trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=944)|
| 0:15:46| Storytelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=946)|
| 0:15:47| Storytelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=947)|
| 0:15:48| And it was really a great event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=948)|
| 0:15:49| So it's going to be an annual event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=949)|
| 0:15:51| But I was so proud to see them be able to pull such a great event off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=951)|
| 0:15:57| And I'm sure they were very pleased themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=957)|
| 0:16:00| I just wanted to shout out to the South Alliance for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=960)|
| 0:16:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=964)|
| 0:16:05| Any other reports from Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=965)|

| 0:19:12| I move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1152)|
| 0:19:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1153)|
| 0:19:14| Councilman Dela Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1154)|
| 0:19:15| Yeah, I was just listening to the things we read that introduced this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1155)|
| 0:19:20| and it occurred to me that maybe some of our citizens don't know what we're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1160)|
| 0:19:23| but the City is very good at applying for grant monies for overall projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1163)|
| 0:19:28| and we're picking out entities within this organization, the city itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1168)|
| 0:19:34| and supporting organizations that are actually specialists in doing this work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1174)|
| 0:19:39| and we're sort of passing down a portion of the money for them to work on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1179)|
| 0:19:44| Maybe that's good for the citizens to know we're not digging into any other pot other than the grant money we have received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1184)|
| 0:19:51| trying to spend it wisely by picking agencies in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1191)|
| 0:19:55| Right, this is a formula grant that comes to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1195)|
| 0:19:58| and it includes actually previous to now the CAT was the only recipient of the 5307 funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1198)|
| 0:20:07| and then the law changed at the federal level, and the urbanized area was expanded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1207)|
| 0:20:14| which meant that ETHRA could qualify for some of that funding, and CAC as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1214)|
| 0:20:22| and so the city in working with TPO, the Transportation Planning Organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1222)|
| 0:20:27| went through a process and application and made recommendations to the TPO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1227)|
| 0:20:34| I mean, the money comes to us as the kind of designated recipient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1234)|
| 0:20:42| and then we can make recommendations to TPO, which Councilwoman Palmer sits on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1242)|
| 0:20:49| on how that money should be divvied up, and then TPO votes on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1249)|
| 0:20:52| But yes, so some dollars that used to come only to CAT areas expanded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1252)|
| 0:20:57| and now we're sharing that money with ETHRA and CAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1257)|
| 0:21:00| And the good news is we're trying to spend the money wisely by picking agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1260)|
| 0:21:03| that already have the skills needed to do the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1263)|
| 0:21:06| We're not recreating the wheel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1266)|
| 0:21:08| All right, they have to meet certain qualifications in order to get that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1268)|
| 0:21:11| including being able to qualify to get the monies directly from the federal government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1271)|
| 0:21:17| from FTA to them, so it doesn't actually come through us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1277)|
| 0:21:20| I'm correct, isn't that Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1280)|
| 0:21:22| Jim York, where's Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1282)|
| 0:21:25| The monies will actually go directly to CAC and to ETHRA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1285)|
| 0:21:34| but it's money that originally gets designated for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1294)|
| 0:21:38| Just another example of the city being prudent on how it does its business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1298)|
| 0:21:42| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1302)|
| 0:21:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1303)|
| 0:21:44| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1304)|

| 0:23:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1421)|
| 0:23:42| Councilman DeLavocq.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1422)|
| 0:23:43| Yeah, I guess I was going to ask Jim Hagerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| We were talking about this the last time when we were talking about buying a few controllers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1425)|
| 0:23:49| with some initial money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1429)|
| 0:23:52| This seems like it's the bigger project that encompasses the idea of modernizing how we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1432)|
| 0:23:59| manage our traffic, but would you tell us about this grant, how we're going to use it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1439)|
| 0:24:05| You're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1445)|
| 0:24:06| I'm Jim Hagerman, Director of Engineering for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1446)|
| 0:24:11| This is funding for a bigger strategic look at the city's signal hardware and capabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1451)|
| 0:24:24| The small amount of hardware that we bought on the contract that you passed last time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1464)|
| 0:24:32| is compatible with everything that we're doing, but it's not fully empowered until we do the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1472)|
| 0:24:37| rest of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1477)|
| 0:24:40| The next step in this is just commitment of funds from the state for us to start the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1480)|
| 0:24:48| Our next step is to do a system analysis and design through a consultant, and then actual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1488)|
| 0:24:55| construction won't start until after that process is complete and TDOT has it certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1495)|
| 0:25:02| I also should do a little expectation management here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1502)|
| 0:25:05| This is just enough to do about half the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1505)|
| 0:25:08| We will continue to be putting money in a matching fund to go to the next step in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1508)|

| 0:26:02| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1562)|
| 0:26:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1563)|
| 0:26:04| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1564)|
| 0:26:05| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1565)|
| 0:26:06| 11-K, a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute a limited-use agreement with McDonald's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1566)|
| 0:26:12| Real Estate Company, allowing limited vehicular access to cross the Cumberland Avenue median| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1572)|
| 0:26:17| for purpose of deliveries to the McDonald's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1577)|
| 0:26:21| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1581)|
| 0:26:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1582)|
| 0:26:23| Councilman Dalibopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1583)|
| 0:26:24| Yeah, we still have Ann Wallace here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| Maybe she can come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| This triggers, in my mind, a question of how many folks are concerned about cutoffs of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1589)|
| 0:26:36| left turns into their property to do business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1596)|
| 0:26:38| I noticed this was very restricted, and it was in the wee hours of 2 a.m. to 6 or 7 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1598)|
| 0:26:44| But would you tell us about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1604)|
| 0:26:45| This is sort of a left turn, maybe different than we had planned overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1605)|
| 0:26:50| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1610)|
| 0:26:51| Thank you, Councilman Dalibopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1611)|
| 0:26:52| Again, Ann Wallace with the Office of Redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1612)|
| 0:26:55| In this particular case, one of the challenges to this particular location is that while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1615)|
| 0:27:01| it's on a corner lot and does have access from 18th Street as well as directly from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1621)|
| 0:27:06| Cumberland Avenue, the size and scale of the trucks that visit their property to deliver| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1626)|
| 0:27:10| product is such that it cannot make the grade at the 18th Street access point and get around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1630)|
| 0:27:16| the building to be able to service the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| And so as part of our negotiations with regards to the right-of-way for this property, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1638)|
| 0:27:23| agreed to investigate and look at the opportunity for them to cross the median in non-peak traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1643)|
| 0:27:28| times and create a limited use agreement for them to be able to do so legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1648)|
| 0:27:33| And again, the provision allows for them to maintain any damage that's created to the median,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1653)|
| 0:27:40| although we are also designing it such that it would be safe for and constructed such| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1660)|
| 0:27:45| that it would be able to handle that traffic movement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1665)|
| 0:27:48| Well, so that gets the Big Macs into McDonald's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1668)|
| 0:27:50| Is there any other pressure on access by merchants along there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1670)|
| 0:27:55| At this point in time, we have not received any further requests for treatment similar to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1675)|
| 0:28:00| and most every other site doesn't have the same challenges with the topography that the McDonald's site has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1680)|
| 0:28:05| It's sort of uphill or something, isn't it, a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| Correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1687)|
| 0:28:08| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1688)|
| 0:28:09| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1689)|
| 0:28:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1690)|
| 0:28:11| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1691)|
| 0:28:12| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1692)|
| 0:28:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1693)|
| 0:28:14| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1694)|
| 0:28:15| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1695)|
| 0:28:16| 11L, a resolution approving the Cumberland Avenue Redevelopment and Urban Renewal Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1696)|
| 0:28:21| prepared by Knoxville's Community Development Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1701)|
| 0:28:24| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1704)|
| 0:28:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1705)|
| 0:28:26| Let me start with Councilman Wallace, because he hasn't spoken yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1706)|
| 0:28:29| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1709)|
| 0:28:31| Yes, Bob, you and I talked this afternoon, but I went to the meeting two weeks ago, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1711)|
| 0:28:37| at the UT Federal Credit Union about this, and we heard a lot of support from this from the area business owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1717)|
| 0:28:44| But I kind of wanted to talk a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1724)|
| 0:28:46| This is a little bit different for us, if I understand it right, to designate an area for an unspecified parking garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1726)|
| 0:28:57| It's a little speculative, and for us to do a TIF for a parking garage is a little bit different, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1737)|
| 0:29:04| So I kind of wanted to get you to explain that and how we're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| Just a little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1746)|
| 0:29:07| Typically, garages in the past have been built with some sort of debt structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1747)|
| 0:29:11| just as this is a sort of debt structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| So you would get the bond proceeds and build a garage and pay it back with the proceeds from that garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1754)|
| 0:29:22| In this case, we're trying to set up this particular district to capture this new increment to go towards this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1762)|
| 0:29:28| because there's such a lot of development going on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| and we think this will really add to development as it goes forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1770)|
| 0:29:35| There is already a lot of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1775)|
| 0:29:36| So almost unlike some of the other areas where we've done redevelopment, there's already a lot of business going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1776)|
| 0:29:42| So give me the argument why we would create this redevelopment district for an area that's not blighted and kind of not under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1782)|
| 0:29:51| There is a blight down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1791)|
| 0:29:53| We do feel like there is a blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| There's the designation of blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| Jordan Anderson is here at the KCD, so he can talk in detail on what the conditions of blight are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1796)|
| 0:30:04| What you have is a lot of smaller businesses, too, that don't have parking directly access to them, and we need to support those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1804)|
| 0:30:11| We talked about a new form-based code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1811)|
| 0:30:13| As that goes forward, we feel like we can support the pedestrian environment better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1813)|
| 0:30:17| if we have this garage structure for people who have predictable parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1817)|
| 0:30:20| You can come and you can get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| You can drive in from West Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1822)|
| 0:30:25| You can drive down from Fountain City, and there's a place to park and go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1825)|
| 0:30:28| We think that's really going to add to the economic development of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1828)|
| 0:30:31| We built other garages there, and we haven't done it in a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| I guess that's either the State Street Garage or the new one that I call the Langley Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1834)|
| 0:30:41| Even Market Square, that wasn't a TIF either, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1841)|
| 0:30:44| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1844)|
| 0:30:45| They were not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1845)|
| 0:30:46| We feel like this is a way to get the funds designated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1846)|
| 0:30:50| We're trying to get in place a funding source so we can go forward to building a garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1850)|
| 0:30:54| and there's a lot of planning to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1854)|
| 0:30:55| We have to find our site, and we have to get our design plan, so there's still a lot of work to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1855)|
| 0:30:59| We're just trying to get this funding source in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1859)|
| 0:31:01| And roughly, you're estimating that it's somewhere between 500 and 800 spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1861)|
| 0:31:05| That's what we've talked, the kind of number we're talking about, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1865)|
| 0:31:08| And that kind of cuts out a general estimated guesstimate of around 15 million plus whatever the land costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1868)|
| 0:31:14| No, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| You mentioned one other thing that the county hasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| You're taking it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| We're talking with the county about the project right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| We're trying to see how far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| They have to approve this as well, so we're in discussion with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1887)|
| 0:31:30| So without the county's approval, it wouldn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1890)|
| 0:31:35| That's correct, because the TIF will affect both the city and county tax base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1895)|
| 0:31:41| And usually before we've come and voted on this, we've kind of had a handshake deal with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1901)|
| 0:31:48| We're not there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| We're not quite there yet on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1910)|
| 0:31:53| I think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1913)|
| 0:31:54| And you've seen, we've talked about it downtown, that parking garages do spur more development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1914)|
| 0:32:00| And I think it's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| And it was very well received two weeks ago out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| It is a little bit different than the last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1925)|
| 0:32:07| Or from my short tenure on council, it's a little bit different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1927)|
| 0:32:10| It's slightly different, but I think every project collected is slightly different, put together slightly differently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1930)|
| 0:32:14| as the funding sources move around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| Thanks for your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1936)|
| 0:32:17| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1937)|
| 0:32:18| Councilman Dallavovi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1938)|
| 0:32:19| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1939)|
| 0:32:20| And I appreciate the questions that George asked and then Bob answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1940)|
| 0:32:24| I'm just a little curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1944)|
| 0:32:26| I understand, I think, the process we have or the procedures that we have that we need to have this sort of redevelopment district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1946)|
| 0:32:36| or determination in order to approve TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1956)|
| 0:32:40| And so in one sense it's a formality, but in the other it's a little odd to me that we have to declare the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1960)|
| 0:32:47| as it says on page 202, blighted, deteriorated, and deteriorating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1967)|
| 0:32:53| And it strikes me that that's probably the magic base someone has to touch in order to make this determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1973)|
| 0:33:00| Obviously, the intentions and the goals are good, but I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1980)|
| 0:33:05| For an area in the heart of our city, Cumberland Avenue is a blighted area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1985)|
| 0:33:10| There's a lot of surface parking lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1990)|
| 0:33:12| There's a lot of one-story buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1992)|
| 0:33:13| There's a lot of vacant buildings or a fair amount of vacant buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| It's just it's moved into this suburban kind of sprawl feel as we're trying to turn that around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=1996)|
| 0:33:22| It's certainly blighted compared to that standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| I agree 100 percent with the intention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2004)|
| 0:33:25| I'm just saying it struck me as a little odd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| But this is the only vehicle we have, I take it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2007)|
| 0:33:30| That is the standard, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2010)|
| 0:33:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2011)|
| 0:33:32| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2012)|
| 0:33:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2015)|
| 0:33:36| Bob, yeah, I also attended that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2016)|
| 0:33:38| It was a good meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2018)|
| 0:33:39| But just for public information, the garage that you're talking about, where would the garage be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2019)|
| 0:33:46| It will be within the Cumberland Avenue Redevelopment District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2026)|
| 0:33:50| That's the best answer I can give you at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2030)|
| 0:33:53| You haven't narrowed that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2033)|
| 0:33:54| We're not quite there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2034)|
| 0:33:55| That's how preliminary a lot of this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| We're trying to get the funding procedure in place and then to continue to we will continue to talk with property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2037)|
| 0:34:03| It's a very expensive property and it's a property that's kind of chopped up, so it's hard to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2043)|
| 0:34:07| So we're trying to get a funding model in place that will help us move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2047)|
| 0:34:11| I'm very supportive of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| Anytime I hear urban renewal, those words, I know in my community, urban renewal turned out to be not so great as it was hoped to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2053)|
| 0:34:26| And so I always look for a little bit of help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| We certainly understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2068)|
| 0:34:29| We try to learn from the past and move forward with better products.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2069)|
| 0:34:32| I'm very supportive of it, and I think it will be a good program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2072)|
| 0:34:36| Vice Mayor Pavlos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2076)|
| 0:34:37| I mean, just to let folks know, I mean, if you talk to the business community down there, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2077)|
| 0:34:43| they'll tell you that things aren't particularly thriving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2083)|
| 0:34:48| They have a lot of struggles, and I think one of the, without a doubt, the most advanced thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2088)|
| 0:34:55| or what was really the icing on the cake for the success that downtown has experienced has been the parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2095)|
| 0:35:04| There is just no parking to speak of over at UT campus for folks that live in the quadrants of the city to come over and visit the merchants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2104)|
| 0:35:13| I'm sure that the students do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| Of course, the restaurants, which is a lot of what Cumberland is composed of, competes with UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2115)|
| 0:35:22| I mean, they have a lot of restaurants, a lot of food service, what have you, opportunities within the campus itself, and that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2122)|
| 0:35:31| I just want everyone to understand, if you talk to the merchants down there, I think you'll understand some of them are doing okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2131)|
| 0:35:39| but with this parking garage or the advent of it, and I surely hope that this will come to fruition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2139)|
| 0:35:46| that that will be the determining, the turnabout, the turnaround, along with the form-based codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2146)|
| 0:35:54| to make this a very extension of downtown, a very vibrant area for our city, for our students that live here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2154)|
| 0:36:02| and there's a lot of them, and we appreciate what they bring to our economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2162)|
| 0:36:07| So this is critical, I think, for the success of the whole project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2167)|
| 0:36:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2175)|

| 0:40:41| Bob Wessel, this looks like housekeeping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2441)|

| 0:41:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2470)|
| 0:41:11| Councilman Dela Vothe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2471)|
| 0:41:12| Well, I guess I'm excited that we got more money than we estimated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2472)|
| 0:41:18| and that we tried to be conservative and our shift came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2478)|
| 0:41:22| I just think that some part of this, I guess it's what, 3.5 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2482)|
| 0:41:29| 4.35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2489)|
| 0:41:30| 4.35 million left over our estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2490)|
| 0:41:34| It should be set aside and saved for a rainy day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2494)|
| 0:41:37| and I've read the argument that we have a healthy fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2497)|
| 0:41:42| But, again, I don't see why we couldn't set aside at least 25% of this money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2502)|
| 0:41:47| to prepare for what we don't know about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2507)|
| 0:41:50| I'm sure all the projects are good and interesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2510)|
| 0:41:53| but I don't know why we have to spend every penny of that excess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2513)|
| 0:41:58| And I would ask that we shave 25% off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2518)|
| 0:42:01| and save it for the rainy day we don't know about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2521)|
| 0:42:09| I guess I'll respond and ask Jim York to respond on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2529)|
| 0:42:13| Remember the last time when we had surplus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2533)|
| 0:42:15| and we brought it to you last spring, I guess it was late winter, early spring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2535)|
| 0:42:19| 62% of that we did set aside into the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2539)|
| 0:42:25| Come on down, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2545)|
| 0:42:26| We could do it again, I guess is my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| Well, we could, but, you know, how much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2548)|
| 0:42:31| when there are so many projects that need to be completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2551)|
| 0:42:35| when you've got deferred maintenance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| that the longer we defer it the more it costs us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2557)|
| 0:42:40| when you've got private sector development happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2560)|
| 0:42:43| or in one of the cases KUB tearing up a street to sink utilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2563)|
| 0:42:49| then this is the time when we move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| So this is actually a way, if you want to save money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| we save money by spending this money now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2573)|
| 0:42:56| because you save it in the long run from other projects, more costly projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2576)|
| 0:42:59| I understand you're calling it an investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2579)|
| 0:43:00| Let me just finish, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2580)|
| 0:43:01| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2581)|
| 0:43:02| So our argument, when you have a very healthy fund balance, which we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2582)|
| 0:43:06| when you have $10 million that we put into the pensions a couple years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2586)|
| 0:43:13| when we had excess funds, when you've got the highest fund ratings ever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2593)|
| 0:43:18| and, you know, when you've got this kind of history of excellent financial management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2598)|
| 0:43:23| as just recognized by the bond raters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2603)|
| 0:43:26| then this is the time to invest wisely in infrastructure and in deferred maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2606)|
| 0:43:31| And so we are known for setting aside dollars to save,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2611)|
| 0:43:35| but when you've got the highest, we were looking at this right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2615)|
| 0:43:39| right now we end this fiscal year with the highest fund balance in how many years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2619)|
| 0:43:44| This will be the highest fund balance in history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2624)|
| 0:43:47| In history, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2627)|
| 0:43:49| And so we're going to take $4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| Appreciated dollars, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2631)|
| 0:43:52| We're going to take $4.35 of that, and so we're right now at $70 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2632)|
| 0:43:59| Talk about that, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2639)|
| 0:44:00| We're at $70 million roughly right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2640)|
| 0:44:01| We end in this fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| We'll take $4.35 and put it into basically saving dollars by investing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2643)|
| 0:44:09| and we will still end up with, I think, the largest or close to the largest in history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2649)|
| 0:44:16| Jim York, finance director for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2656)|
| 0:44:21| What we experienced this year, and, again, these numbers are pretty close to final,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2661)|
| 0:44:26| is for the year the city in its general fund will see a gain of roughly $850,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2666)|
| 0:44:36| which will push our fund balance up to $70,811,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2676)|
| 0:44:43| Now, when we did a forecast, when we were talking in, I guess, late January or early February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2683)|
| 0:44:50| we had forecasted that we would experience a loss of roughly just under $5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2690)|
| 0:45:00| What we have experienced is an extraordinary good year in the hall income tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2700)|
| 0:45:07| Everything else pretty much came in as forecast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2707)|
| 0:45:11| Our numbers were off by less than one-half of one percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2711)|
| 0:45:18| I can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2718)|
| 0:45:20| Hall income tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| And since we did experience that good a year, basically we had, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2722)|
| 0:45:30| thought we would spend that money last year, a good year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2730)|
| 0:45:34| Now we're proposing to invest that in various capital projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2734)|
| 0:45:39| These are one-time in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2739)|
| 0:45:42| They are not ongoing operational costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2742)|
| 0:45:47| and in some cases they will actually may help us reduce future operational costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2747)|
| 0:45:54| So in terms of, if you look at it in terms of an investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2754)|
| 0:45:59| it is probably a very good investment to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2759)|
| 0:46:03| and basically move up some projects that we would be forced to do in the future at any point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2763)|
| 0:46:11| Again, we have just, well, we're actually going to market tomorrow to issue debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2771)|
| 0:46:17| We have just had our ratings reaffirmed at AAA by Fitch and AA plus and AA1 by Moody's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2777)|
| 0:46:26| Again, those are the highest bond rankings in the city's history that I know of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2786)|
| 0:46:32| I can guarantee you that the fund balance is the highest in history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2792)|
| 0:46:35| and I'm pretty sure that's the highest bond rating ever as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2795)|
| 0:46:41| All the bond rating agencies were very complimentary of our practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2801)|
| 0:46:48| Investing in this will not jeopardize those ratings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2808)|
| 0:46:52| It is probably, again, they look at it as long as we are investing in one-time capital projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2812)|
| 0:46:59| and taking a very prudent fiscal approach, then I think it is a good thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2819)|
| 0:47:06| So hopefully that answers some of your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2826)|
| 0:47:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2830)|
| 0:47:11| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2831)|
| 0:47:12| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2832)|
| 0:47:13| I think it's a really prudent way to spend the money, and, Christy, I appreciate you calling me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2833)|
| 0:47:18| and going through the details on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2838)|
| 0:47:22| I think it's when you have a surplus, it's purely surplus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2842)|
| 0:47:26| We paid the money back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2846)|
| 0:47:27| We spent last year and last year's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2847)|
| 0:47:30| We haven't pulled anything out, to my recollection, this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2850)|
| 0:47:33| as far as big capital million-dollar improvements or extra charges, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2853)|
| 0:47:37| This is the first budget amendment for the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2857)|
| 0:47:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2860)|
| 0:47:41| So that's a big difference between this year and last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2861)|
| 0:47:44| So I've looked at these, and I think it's a prudent way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2864)|
| 0:47:49| You're not adding to the overall monthly expense, so we're not using it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2869)|
| 0:47:55| So I think it's a good use, and I definitely support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2875)|
| 0:47:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2878)|
| 0:47:59| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2879)|
| 0:48:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2880)|
| 0:48:02| I support what Councilman Wallace has said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| the fact that this is a good use of money that we really didn't expect to find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2884)|
| 0:48:10| It allows us to stop deferring maintenance that has occurred over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2890)|
| 0:48:15| I don't know about others, but I get calls about the golf cart pathways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2895)|
| 0:48:21| and the poor condition and the fact that it really creates some issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2901)|
| 0:48:25| And so I was excited, and so were some of the people in my district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2905)|
| 0:48:29| who play at the Chaud Road course often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2909)|
| 0:48:32| But I think the other improvements are important, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2912)|
| 0:48:35| And while I understand that Councilman Della Bope is very interested in a strong fund balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2915)|
| 0:48:41| and I don't want us to be broke either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2921)|
| 0:48:44| but I also think that we have a very healthy fund balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2924)|
| 0:48:47| and we don't need to keep building that at the expense of maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2927)|
| 0:48:51| that must occur throughout the city for the people who can enjoy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2931)|
| 0:48:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2937)|
| 0:48:58| Vice Mayor Pavlos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2938)|
| 0:48:59| Yeah, I won't belabor it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| I appreciate what Councilman Della Bope has brought forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2941)|
| 0:49:04| I think it makes me understand what he's saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2944)|
| 0:49:07| But our fiscal house is in order, there's no doubt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2947)|
| 0:49:11| It's the best that it's ever been, our bond rating, the rainy day fund, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2951)|
| 0:49:16| But I also think that we have an obligation to keep our public facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2956)|
| 0:49:21| the investment that we've made with taxpayers' dollars, we need to keep them in tip-top shape,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2961)|
| 0:49:28| because if you let them deteriorate, it will just cost more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2968)|
| 0:49:31| This is probably, in recent history, the cheapest money you could borrow is out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2971)|
| 0:49:37| and it's just a good time to make these non-reoccurring, spend this money on non-reoccurring expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2977)|
| 0:49:44| I think it's the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2984)|
| 0:49:46| I'm going to support it, and I just want to keep us moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2986)|
| 0:49:50| I think we've got an unusual situation here, a perfect storm, if you will, in this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2990)|
| 0:49:57| and what we've got in this excess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2997)|
| 0:49:59| So I think that it's time for us to move forward with this, and I'm going to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=2999)|
| 0:50:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3005)|
| 0:50:06| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3006)|
| 0:50:07| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3007)|
| 0:50:08| I won't belabor the point either and just reiterate what Councilman Wallace-Palmer and Pavlos had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3008)|
| 0:50:13| I think one of the things that we need to keep in mind is that we do have this money now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3013)|
| 0:50:18| and we'll get more for our buck this year than we will next year or the following years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3018)|
| 0:50:23| And I think that I want to commend Christy, too, for the conversations that we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3023)|
| 0:50:28| but also for the work in putting this together and the understanding that you sent to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3028)|
| 0:50:34| So I fully support this, and I think it's imperative that we move ahead with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3034)|
| 0:50:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3038)|
| 0:50:39| Councilman Del Vecchio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3039)|
| 0:50:40| Well, nobody's belaboring anything, but I do want to get back to two points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3040)|
| 0:50:44| One is you said we're going out for debt tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3044)|
| 0:50:47| Why can't we borrow less money instead of spending all of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3047)|
| 0:50:51| How much are we borrowing tomorrow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3051)|
| 0:50:53| The planned issuance cost, and, again, we don't know the final sizing, is $31.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3053)|
| 0:51:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3060)|
| 0:51:01| So sitting here, the county is trying to reduce its debt, and we're going to increase our debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3061)|
| 0:51:05| and we've talked about that in the past, but we're going out to borrow money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3065)|
| 0:51:08| We could be actually spending some of this money instead of borrowing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3068)|
| 0:51:12| The second point and final point is you mentioned the $70 million as a rainy day fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3072)|
| 0:51:18| but that's a surplus fund, and some of that is committed money for projects we already have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3078)|
| 0:51:22| There's an unallocated, uncommitted balance that's really the rainy day fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3082)|
| 0:51:27| Would you tell me that number as opposed to dollars that are committed for ongoing activity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3087)|
| 0:51:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| I'm going to get very technical here, so please bear with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3094)|
| 0:51:38| Out of the $70 million, there is a portion that is non-spendable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3098)|
| 0:51:43| That's a fairly small amount that represents prepaid expenses, inventory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3103)|
| 0:51:48| and things that are non-cash related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3108)|
| 0:51:51| There is a restricted piece, which is, again, very small, which are things that are restricted as to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3111)|
| 0:51:59| There is a committed piece, and I want to emphasize this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3119)|
| 0:52:02| The city has a policy that we will set aside a minimum of 20% of each operating budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3122)|
| 0:52:11| and commit that as a reserve and fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3131)|
| 0:52:17| So the committed portion is a very large piece of this fund balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3137)|
| 0:52:24| and that is, again, represents at least 20%, and then there are a few other things in there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3144)|
| 0:52:30| Previously committed items that council has taken action on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3150)|
| 0:52:35| There is an assigned piece that represents encumbrances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3155)|
| 0:52:40| and then there is an appropriation of fund balance, which is equal to the reserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3160)|
| 0:52:44| That's currently $1.85 million, or excuse me, $2.104.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3164)|
| 0:52:50| This year it's $1.85 last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3170)|
| 0:52:54| The balance will be what we call unassigned fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3174)|
| 0:52:59| And, again, this year that's probably going to be on the order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3179)|
| 0:53:02| We haven't run the final numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| It's probably going to be on the order of $26 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3184)|
| 0:53:07| Now, that amount is over and above the 20% that we have already made as a commitment against fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3187)|
| 0:53:14| Right, and I'm not denigrating those numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3194)|
| 0:53:16| but the 26 is more like a rainy day fund than all those other numbers that have purposes they're sort of looking towards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3196)|
| 0:53:23| Well, the 20, obviously the non-spendable piece, you can't spend it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3203)|
| 0:53:27| and the restricted and the assigned are somewhat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3207)|
| 0:53:30| You can actually look at at least the 20% of committed plus the unassigned is kind of what, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3210)|
| 0:53:38| and I'm not going to use the term rainy day fund because that's not accurate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3218)|

| 0:53:49| And, again, the prudent thing, and, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3229)|
| 0:53:52| Council has adopted very prudent policies, and one of those policies says that we will commit no less than 20%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3232)|
| 0:54:00| and that's one of the things that the bond rating agencies have looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3240)|
| 0:54:04| and are very pleased that we have made that commitment, and so they're looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3244)|
| 0:54:09| And the unreserved or the unassigned piece is the piece that I think you have some flexibility with because it is unassigned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3249)|
| 0:54:17| and that's really what we're talking about is taking it out of the unassigned fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3257)|
| 0:54:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3261)|

| 0:54:36| I said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3276)|
| 0:54:37| I wanted to spend 75% of it, not 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3277)|

| 0:56:35| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3395)|
| 0:56:37| I can't let all these four go without expressing a little bit of heartache and concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3397)|
| 0:56:43| I had a conversation with Mark Donaldson and Arthur Seymour today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3403)|
| 0:56:48| I think it's really important to note, and I guess we're, one, I'm concerned about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3408)|
| 0:56:53| intrusion back into this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3413)|
| 0:56:55| When you jump an alley and you're taken all the way back to the front of Atlantic and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3415)|
| 0:57:01| taken that housing and kind of the implications that that leads, the precedent that that sets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3421)|
| 0:57:07| going down or going west on Atlantic for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3427)|
| 0:57:12| I think it's important that they ask for I-3 and we're granting them I-1, and the big difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3432)|
| 0:57:18| is here is that I-1 does come with a use, with the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3438)|
| 0:57:25| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3445)|
| 0:57:26| I guess just summarize that, if you would, Mark, and just make sure that we understand that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3446)|
| 0:57:31| and the difference between I-3 and I-1 and what kind of limitations there are with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3451)|
| 0:57:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3457)|
| 0:57:38| Mark Donaldson with the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3458)|
| 0:57:40| The applicant had, in fact, requested I-3, which is our general industrial zone district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3460)|
| 0:57:46| one of our basic districts, for all seven of the parcels that they're working with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3466)|
| 0:57:53| Staff had originally resisted that and recommended the I-3 only for three of the parcels to the south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3473)|
| 0:58:00| of the alley to keep the residential neighborhood north of the alley intact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3480)|
| 0:58:06| but recommended to the Planning Commission that if there was a desire to rezone the entire seven parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3486)|
| 0:58:13| to go with I-1, which is a planned industrial district requiring development plan approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3493)|
| 0:58:20| by the Planning Commission prior to any development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3500)|
| 0:58:23| And it was created just for this purpose where industrial meets residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3503)|
| 0:58:29| and it has standards in there that can accommodate that meeting in a beneficial way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3509)|
| 0:58:36| So with the plan approval and with the standards that are in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3516)|
| 0:58:39| I think we can create a development that's compatible with the surrounding neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3519)|
| 0:58:44| and still provides the uses that the applicant has in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3524)|
| 0:58:50| And I appreciate that because that's where, when you said that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3530)|
| 0:58:52| that's when I jumped over to being a little easier to swallow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3532)|
| 0:58:57| that there are additional stipulations that they're going to have to submit a plan, a landscape plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3537)|
| 0:59:01| They have additional buffers that buffer up against the residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3541)|
| 0:59:04| and then it was set aside for this very use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3544)|
| 0:59:07| But anyway, I couldn't let it pass without at least some discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3547)|
| 0:59:10| Well put, well put.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3550)|
| 0:59:12| Councilman, nothing else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3552)|
| 0:59:14| No, nothing else to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3554)|
| 0:59:16| Okay, any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3556)|

| 1:00:09| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3609)|
| 1:00:11| Yeah, I've got to say something about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3611)|
| 1:00:13| The community out in that area, at least the Town Hill East portion of it, was a little concerned about this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3613)|
| 1:00:20| It had come in to MPC seeking C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3620)|
| 1:00:24| They were hoping it would be C1, which was neighborhood commercial, a little less intense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3624)|
| 1:00:30| MPC came up with Office 1 as their idea of how it would be a better transitional use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3630)|
| 1:00:37| Maybe I could ask Mark Donaldson to explain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3637)|
| 1:00:40| I think the dust has settled and we're okay here, but I wanted to understand why the O1 from MPC's viewpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3640)|
| 1:00:50| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3650)|
| 1:00:51| Mark Donaldson with MPC again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3651)|
| 1:00:53| The O1 district has traditionally been used as part of that transition from commercial into residential properties throughout the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3653)|
| 1:01:03| and it's one of our few mixed-use districts in that it allows residential development with development plan approval by the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3663)|
| 1:01:12| in addition to the office uses, which are by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3672)|
| 1:01:18| There is within the area already some vacant commercial property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3678)|
| 1:01:23| so the idea of adding more commercial property to that area seemed less beneficial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3683)|
| 1:01:31| than adding a potential mixed-use project to that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3691)|
| 1:01:37| which is at the first intersection west of the interchange of I-40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3697)|
| 1:01:43| So it's as the commercial area transitions into the residential area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3703)|
| 1:01:48| so it seemed to be a pretty good location for the office zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3708)|
| 1:01:53| Yeah, and, of course, right by the interstate, the exit has the traditional things you'd expect to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3713)|
| 1:01:57| a gas station, a waffle house, whatever, a liquor store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3717)|
| 1:02:00| Some businesses that catch folks as they come off the interstate on their way home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3720)|
| 1:02:06| you're saying the office takes you down to a more user-friendly related to the residential area that adjoins and surrounds it, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3726)|
| 1:02:15| Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3735)|
| 1:02:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3736)|
| 1:02:17| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3737)|
| 1:02:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3738)|

| 1:02:20| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3740)|
| 1:02:22| I think, here again, it's kind of the same argument or the same discussion that you just had on the last property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3742)|
| 1:02:28| I mean, you're looking at, you've got to look at it in context that you've got eight other properties on the north side of Asheville Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3748)|
| 1:02:38| and the precedent's going to be set in 01 and, again, talk with Mark about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3758)|
| 1:02:43| I think that's the appropriate zone for that and kind of gives you flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3763)|
| 1:02:48| It's more likely to be small office or use of those homes or could be small office or residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3768)|
| 1:02:53| But, again, it'll be the first property really rezoned in that line of homes along Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3773)|
| 1:02:59| Asheville Highway's a major corridor, and I think that's long since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3779)|
| 1:03:04| But I think it's better served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3784)|
| 1:03:06| To me, I think it would be better served in an office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3786)|
| 1:03:08| So I think it's a good and appropriate zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3788)|

| 1:05:12| We're glad to see you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3912)|
| 1:05:14| Thank you, Mayor O'Hara.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3914)|
| 1:05:15| Mayor, I hope you make that an annual event, the 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3915)|
| 1:05:18| I'm looking forward to this one, because I'm going to pass it on to every passenger I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3918)|
| 1:05:25| Okay, my name is Vennie Anastacio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3925)|
| 1:05:28| Address, 21 Locust Street, Apartment 1011, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3928)|
| 1:05:34| Okay, first question I have to the City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3934)|
| 1:05:37| On the Knoxville Convention, you know, the Coliseum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3937)|
| 1:05:42| has anyone looked into the cost of tearing it down or remodeling it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3942)|
| 1:05:50| If you decide to remodel it, I'd like to see better seats, cameras on top,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3950)|
| 1:05:58| so people can see the shows and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3958)|
| 1:06:01| Also, I'd like to see better concessions, a clean roof on the Coliseum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3961)|
| 1:06:08| because you go by there on a bus and it's disgusting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3968)|
| 1:06:12| I mean, it hasn't been cleaned in years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3972)|
| 1:06:15| Also, let's see, one that does not leak, because there's an employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3975)|
| 1:06:20| I'm not going to mention his name, he said the roof leaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3980)|
| 1:06:23| Okay, and on the 4.3 million, I'd like to see if Broadway to Jackson can be paved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3983)|
| 1:06:33| and 8th Avenue also, and Finch Park on the side of the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=3993)|
| 1:06:40| on the side where the History Museum is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=4000)|
| 1:06:43| because there is a piece of one of the East Avenue olden days, the railroad tracks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=4003)|
| 1:06:48| and it's coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=4008)|
| 1:06:50| And the one on 8th Avenue, I've talked to the engineering department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=4010)|
| 1:06:54| I've talked to the public works department, and I've told them where it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=4014)|
| 1:07:00| and nothing has been done in the past couple of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=4020)|
| 1:07:03| What's going on on 8th Avenue, if you go all the way down 8th Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=4023)|
| 1:07:08| there is a part on the corner of 8th and Gillespie where the asphalt has come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=4028)|
| 1:07:17| from years of wear and tear, and people have come over with their tires and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=4037)|
| 1:07:23| And I've talked to engineering about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=4043)|
| 1:07:26| They said they were going to send somebody out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=4046)|
| 1:07:28| Nothing has been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=4048)|
| 1:07:29| And then I've called public works, and I'm getting the runaround.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=4049)|
| 1:07:33| And all I'm asking is that because somebody, if they go over that part right there on the corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=4053)|
| 1:07:39| somebody is going to blow a tire, and they're going to hit a telephone pole, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=4059)|
| 1:07:45| That was my main concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=4065)|
| 1:07:46| And the one on Broadway, basically where they cut into pipes years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=4066)|
| 1:07:58| I think it was two years ago, what's happened is the asphalt, where they cut into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=4078)|
| 1:08:04| it's coming up on the left-hand side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=4084)|
| 1:08:08| So that's why I'm asking with the $4.3 million if that could be paved just as far as Jackson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=4088)|
| 1:08:16| And on the bridges, last thing, on the bridges, I want to know if next year's budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=4096)|
| 1:08:22| that the Broadway Bridge can be considered for repairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=4102)|
| 1:08:26| because the sidewalk on the right-hand side, it's coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=4106)|
| 1:08:32| The asphalt is coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=4112)|
| 1:08:34| And also I'd like to let public works know also is that they put some sand on Wall Avenue next to the parking garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=4114)|
| 1:08:43| and that sand is coming up, and there's chunks about that big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=4123)|
| 1:08:46| And they put the chunks right on the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=4126)|
| 1:08:50| And that needs to be corner of Walnut and Wall Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=4130)|
| 1:08:55| Thank you for your time, Mayor O'Hara and the City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=4135)|
| 1:08:59| And Mayor O'Hara, I'm looking forward to this Asian one, because I love Asian food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=4139)|
| 1:09:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=4144)|
| 1:09:05| We'll see you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=4145)|
| 1:09:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=4146)|
| 1:09:07| And, hey, Benny, remember, when you have issues like this, it's good to call 311.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=4147)|
| 1:09:11| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=4151)|
| 1:09:12| Okay, because then it'll be in a record, and we can track it better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=4152)|
| 1:09:16| And some of those questions, why don't you stick around when we adjourn here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=4156)|
| 1:09:19| and maybe talk to Mr. Hagerman, and he can explain really how we get some of those things addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=4159)|
| 1:09:25| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=4165)|
| 1:09:26| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=4166)|
| 1:09:27| Okay, Council, that is the end of our agenda, so we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=4167)|
| 1:09:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=4186)|
| 1:10:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil140916?start=4216)|
