| 0:01:05| All members are present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=65)|
| 0:01:07| Thank you very much, Madam Clerk. I know we have several department heads here, as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=67)|
| 0:01:15| as Mr. Caldwell and Jennifer Bode. I see that Perry is with us as well. If any commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=75)|
| 0:01:26| have questions, please feel free to turn your lights on at any time. We do not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=86)|
| 0:01:31| a particular list of department heads who have asked to speak. However, if commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=91)|
| 0:01:36| have any questions, I'm sure they would be more than happy to come down and address anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=96)|
| 0:01:40| So I'll start off with Commissioner Smith. The light is on, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=100)|
| 0:01:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just wanted to, as far as the order of the agenda, if there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=104)|
| 0:01:51| are any persons from the public, are there any signed up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=111)|
| 0:01:56| As of this morning, we had no one sign up for public forum for this particular hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=116)|
| 0:02:00| Okay. Mark me down for it. Never mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=120)|
| 0:02:03| Thank you, Commissioner Smith. I'll call on Mr. Caldwell first, if you'd like to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=123)|
| 0:02:09| to the podium and offer a few comments, and then commissioners may weigh in as they so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=129)|
| 0:02:14| choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=134)|
| 0:02:19| Thank you for this time, and we'll go over just briefly what's before you. I know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=139)|
| 0:02:28| we passed out at the budget address the proposed FY23 budget book, and I know that some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=148)|
| 0:02:38| you all have looked at this in earnest, and I have received some questions from some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=158)|
| 0:02:43| you all, and answered those as you all have had those. This budget basically is increased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=163)|
| 0:02:52| over the current fiscal year by about $60.5 million. We're at about a total of $954.1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=172)|
| 0:03:02| million now gross budget, if you count all of our operating funds. The biggest increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=182)|
| 0:03:10| in this budget is toward education, and the amount of $49.5 million, which is budget over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=190)|
| 0:03:17| budget. The biggest increase in this budget from the standpoint of revenue would be that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=197)|
| 0:03:31| of sales tax to the tune of about $46 million budget to budget. And we don't anticipate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=211)|
| 0:03:43| that much growth from actual to budget, and we actually think we're going to end this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=223)|
| 0:03:48| fiscal year with about $232 million in sales tax, where you can see that our actual growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=228)|
| 0:03:54| and local option sales tax is reasonable. It's probably 3% or so, 4%. Other than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=234)|
| 0:04:05| modest growth and property tax of about $7 million, which you add those two together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=245)|
| 0:04:13| and it gets you about to where you thought it would be. We've made some adjustments to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=253)|
| 0:04:20| revenues. The local state grants, as we talked about, have went away. That was $2.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=260)|
| 0:04:29| About $1.2 million went to the general fund. Another $1.2 went to engineering. And so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=269)|
| 0:04:39| really were challenged this year to keep our paving budget the same with the state reducing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=279)|
| 0:04:46| those funds, but we were able to do so with the growth in local option sales tax and gasoline tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=286)|
| 0:04:54| And so this budget does use about $1.8 million more in fund balance than the current budget does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=294)|
| 0:05:09| A portion of that is related to debt service and the fact that we budget our variable rate interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=309)|
| 0:05:17| at a higher rate, and historically we've been paying less. Now, keep in mind, as the feds have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=317)|
| 0:05:22| raising interest rates, then we'll start paying more in not only those debt service costs as it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=322)|
| 0:05:28| relates to our variable rate debt, but as we issue debt going forward, we anticipate a higher interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=328)|
| 0:05:37| cost on that as well. With that being said, I'll answer any questions or defer to anyone in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=337)|
| 0:05:52| Commissioner Hill, you are first, followed by Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=352)|
| 0:05:56| Thank you. Mr. Caldwell, on the variable rate on these bonds that you discussed, is there a preferred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=356)|
| 0:06:09| method, variable as opposed to fixed? I mean, I know they sell them fixed also. I just would like to hear what you think on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=369)|
| 0:06:19| Sure. Good question. We historically issue fixed rate bonds 20 years is what we have historically done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=379)|
| 0:06:32| since I have taken over the role of director. We have in the past and are continuing to pay on some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=392)|
| 0:06:41| variable rate debt. It doesn't hurt to diversify a little, but we have some variable rate debt and we also have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=401)|
| 0:06:51| swaps that we look to get out of when interest rates continue to go up, and so we'll watch that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=411)|
| 0:07:00| We are coming upon a place in time when we have some 28-year bonds that we start to pay the principal on in those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=420)|
| 0:07:10| last eight years, and so that starts, I think, in 2027. Historically, what you have saw from us is we issued bonds a couple of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=430)|
| 0:07:18| months ago. We normally do a 20-year fixed rate bond. Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=438)|
| 0:07:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Director Caldwell, on page 16 of the proposed budget book under the expenditure summary by fund, could you weigh in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=451)|
| 0:07:44| on the parks allocations? On some of the department numbers you're showing, no expenditure from the previous fiscal year for parks, greenways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=464)|
| 0:07:56| trails. You've got park maintenance decreasing by about a million dollars. You've got no expenditures for Ballfield, Sports Park, Tommy Shumpert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=476)|
| 0:08:07| Park, John Tarleton Park. Could you explain where you've now reallocated those expenditures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=487)|
| 0:08:14| Absolutely. So what you have on your book is you have actuals for 2021, which we'll go back and tie into our ACFR. You have adopted for FY22,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=494)|
| 0:08:27| requested for 23, and proposed for 23. This is Director Mack's first year of proposing a budget for Parks and Rec, and so what he wanted to do was to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=507)|
| 0:08:42| break out Parks and Rec more and have additional org codes. So what you are seeing there with park improvements in Ballfields and Sports Parks and Tommy Shumpert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=522)|
| 0:08:56| Park, he's breaking that out more in detail than what has historically been done. And so the way we look at it is we look at from Parks, which is 101-4801 to Adult Sports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=536)|
| 0:09:10| which is 101-4857. Adopted for 22, the parks budget was about 5.34 million. This budget is about 7 million at 6.995, but about 961,000 of that is driven by increased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=550)|
| 0:09:30| revenue in Youth Sports. Okay. So the different account numbers will come up to the 7 point. What did you say? It's 6,995,424 to be exact. Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=570)|
| 0:09:56| Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker. Any other questions for Mr. Caldwell? Mr. Smith? Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chris, I want to go back to what Commissioner Hill was talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=596)|
| 0:10:07| with the variable rate bonds. I'm not sure what index they're tied to and how interest rate sensitive they are, but are we forward thinking and looking at and analyzing how many rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=607)|
| 0:10:21| hikes it would take before it might be time to convert these to the current market rate? That's a good question. We are fortunate enough to have two financial advisors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=621)|
| 0:10:33| Cumberland Securities and PFM, and we are always working with them to figure out as rate hikes happen or decreases happen, either way, when is the right time to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=633)|
| 0:10:47| and if our bonds are callable, could we get out of the variable rate debt and switch it over to fixed rate? Or I think the most concerning thing for us from the finance department is our swaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=647)|
| 0:11:03| And so we have some interest rate swaps that is basically looked negatively upon by Moody's and S&P, and it can cost to get out of those unless you hold them to maturity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=663)|
| 0:11:17| So our intent is hold them to maturity unless there comes a point to where we could basically break even and get out of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=677)|
| 0:11:27| But to answer your question, we're always looking at those bonds, at all of our bonds, to see when they become callable, can we refund and save interest, or should we switch from variable rate to fixed rate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=687)|
| 0:11:40| And are we forward looking enough to say if rates go up to a certain point, maybe it's time to look at the advantages of variable rate bonding for our capital?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=700)|
| 0:11:49| For sure, right. And so I think if rates can continue to increase, then we get to a certain point that it may be advantageous to us to look at variable rate debt, for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=709)|
| 0:12:00| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=720)|
| 0:12:03| Mr. Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=723)|
| 0:12:04| Thank you, Chairman Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=724)|
| 0:12:06| Chris, I've got a question on page 15-10-11525, jury-related expenses. It's gone up substantially over the past two years. Is that due to virtual jury expenses, or can you fill me in on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=726)|
| 0:12:23| So if you look, and I think what's throwing you there, Commissioner, is the $50,000 in 2021 is actual. If you look at adopted for 2022, it was $217,700, and then we're going to $227,000, so it's only about a $3,000 increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=743)|
| 0:12:40| Basically, the actual was low in 2021 because of COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=760)|
| 0:12:44| Because that's what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=764)|
| 0:12:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=765)|
| 0:12:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=766)|
| 0:12:51| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=771)|
| 0:12:53| Chris, if you know the answer to this, what is the largest budget increase we've ever had without a tax increase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=773)|
| 0:13:04| Well, you know, it's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=784)|
| 0:13:12| We could go back and do some analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=792)|
| 0:13:19| You know, from 21 to 22 is about $42,000, and this one is $60,000, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=799)|
| 0:13:29| I'm going to look at Ron because Ron is my confidant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=809)|
| 0:13:35| I don't remember one this large since I've been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=815)|
| 0:13:44| So I think the key is to, you know, what drives it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=824)|
| 0:13:49| I think what drives it is a finance director who apparently does not know how to estimate sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=829)|
| 0:13:59| I won't blame Ron.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=839)|
| 0:14:01| And so that drives this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=841)|
| 0:14:05| In all seriousness, we take a very conservative approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=845)|
| 0:14:10| And in doing so, it helps us because Ron and I were here in 2008 and 2009 when sales tax went down from $135 to $125| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=850)|
| 0:14:19| and didn't come back above $140 to like $2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=859)|
| 0:14:22| And so we've been through some of those, and we do rely upon the state and their advisors for assistance in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=862)|
| 0:14:31| And talking to Dr. Fox, the state went with a 6% to 7% average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=871)|
| 0:14:37| We historically never hit that state average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=877)|
| 0:14:40| We have some insulation, which is both good and bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=880)|
| 0:14:43| And so we went with about a 2% to 3% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| But, I mean, we do have some concerns about inflation and what that impact is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=887)|
| 0:14:53| And so, but to answer your question, budget to budget, it potentially could be the largest one since 2000, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=893)|
| 0:15:03| And that would have been â€“ 2000 budget would have been the last time the county had a tax increase, FY2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=903)|
| 0:15:10| So it may have been â€“ we can go back and look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=910)|
| 0:15:13| She's telling me I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=913)|
| 0:15:18| This is the largest. This is the largest she's telling me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=918)|
| 0:15:20| Largest one I can remember. Thank you, Jennifer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=920)|
| 0:15:22| I think it speaks well of a lot of things about our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=922)|
| 0:15:27| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=927)|
| 0:15:28| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=928)|
| 0:15:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=929)|
| 0:15:32| Director Caldwell, page 18, towards the bottom of the page, under public safety, account numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=932)|
| 0:15:40| is this basically some of the same things like the Parks Department has done where you're consolidating different expenditures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=940)|
| 0:15:47| So here's what happens for us in these reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=947)|
| 0:15:51| We have to show actual expenses that tie back to our annual report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=951)|
| 0:15:57| So in doing so, we have a lot of OR codes that the sheriff estimates inappropriate through the years â€“| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=957)|
| 0:16:04| well, through the year that doesn't have an â€“ doesn't have an original budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=964)|
| 0:16:08| So in doing so, what we have to do is we have to show inmate education or their program or interest earned off inmates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=968)|
| 0:16:17| So we have to show them to get to our total amount of expenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=977)|
| 0:16:21| but there's not a budget for it because you all approve those monthly or quarterly estimations and appropriations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=981)|
| 0:16:29| That's where those come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=989)|
| 0:16:30| So as monies come in, we estimate and appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=990)|
| 0:16:33| There's just not an original budget for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=993)|
| 0:16:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=995)|
| 0:16:36| And just so you know, for the sheriff's office, this budget is $95,690,098,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=996)|
| 0:16:45| and that compares to the current budget of $91,017,824.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1005)|
| 0:16:51| So about a $4.5 million increase in sheriff's office budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1011)|
| 0:17:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| And then on page 19 at the top under the county medical examiner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1021)|
| 0:17:06| it looks like their budget's increased about a half a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1026)|
| 0:17:09| Is that for new equipment, new personnel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1029)|
| 0:17:13| And go ahead and then I'll â€“| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1033)|
| 0:17:16| No, there's some personnel in there, and there are some increases just due to operations that they have solved just to operate, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1036)|
| 0:17:27| And so part of this has increased in â€“ their revenues have increased as well from autopsies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1047)|
| 0:17:36| whether they're from out-of-county or private autopsies, and we just run that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1056)|
| 0:17:43| And so it also increases their expenses as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1063)|
| 0:17:46| Okay, that was my other question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1066)|
| 0:17:47| They're still doing the out-of-county autopsies for some of our surrounding neighborhoods?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1067)|
| 0:17:51| Yeah, and the revenues included, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1071)|
| 0:17:53| Okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1073)|
| 0:17:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1074)|
| 0:17:55| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1075)|
| 0:17:59| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1079)|
| 0:18:01| Any other questions or comments from the commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1081)|
| 0:18:05| Commissioner Busler, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1085)|
| 0:18:07| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1087)|
| 0:18:09| Mr. Caldwell, I know some of the things that we have that we have liabilities on is tied to the stock market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1089)|
| 0:18:16| and is also affected by inflation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1096)|
| 0:18:19| Is that built into this budget here to take care of these wide swings that we're having right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1099)|
| 0:18:25| So, yes, you know, for us the things in this budget that has an impact related to the stock market would be our actual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1105)|
| 0:18:41| or our required contributions to our closed pension plans, being a closed county plan, closed school plan, and UOP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1121)|
| 0:18:51| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1131)|
| 0:18:52| And so what is included in here is funding 100% of those required contributions for this fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1132)|
| 0:19:06| The old school DB plan, Ron, a year or so ago went to a fixed amount payment of $1.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1146)|
| 0:19:15| This is maybe the second year of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1155)|
| 0:19:18| The county DB actually went down a little bit this year, and Ron and I split that on a pro rata basis, and UOP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1158)|
| 0:19:31| So UOP went up from 7.4 million to about 8.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1171)|
| 0:19:39| Part of that is we decreased the rate of return from 7.25% down to 7%, and so that led to that increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1179)|
| 0:19:51| I would say this, and this will answer your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1191)|
| 0:19:54| If the market continues to do what it's doing now, those contributions are going up for FY24, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1194)|
| 0:20:03| So we will see increases in FY24 related to our actual or required contributions because of market return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1203)|
| 0:20:19| And so we do, through our actuarial, we do spread gains and losses over five years, so it won't be detrimental for a one year hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1219)|
| 0:20:32| But ultimately, those are the things in here for us that's tied to the stock market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1232)|
| 0:20:40| As it relates to inflation, I think there's a number of things in our budget that are tied to inflation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1240)|
| 0:20:49| whether it's fuel, of course, supplies, whether it be food or medical supplies, and you can even go with service contracts, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1249)|
| 0:21:02| So I saw this week where the cost for flights are up 18%, largest month-over-month increase ever or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1262)|
| 0:21:15| So if you're Mr. Webb and you're flying in a consultant to help with things, those contracts can be dependent upon travel, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1275)|
| 0:21:25| And so I think there's a number of things in our budgets that are tied that can have an impact based off inflation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1285)|
| 0:21:33| So when we see those numbers, I do think they do concern us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1293)|
| 0:21:37| Well, you made a statement there, and I'm not sure, I'm not into the real high finances, but you said you were going up on 7%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1297)|
| 0:21:45| but if the inflation rate is at 8.3, aren't we losing ground there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1305)|
| 0:21:50| So I think we're talking about two different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1310)|
| 0:21:53| The 7% is the rate of return on the market, and so that's not tied to, really, inflation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1313)|
| 0:21:59| It's just market return, and so inflation would be separate of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1319)|
| 0:22:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1328)|
| 0:22:12| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1332)|
| 0:22:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1333)|
| 0:22:16| Chris, I'm going to try to simplify the rate of return on the pensions as best I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1336)|
| 0:22:21| If between July 1st of this year and June 29th or 30th of next year, if those funds don't return 7%, our contribution will go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1341)|
| 0:22:38| If it returns more than 7%, it may possibly go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1358)|
| 0:22:42| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1362)|
| 0:22:43| So ultimately, you know, you go back a year ago, I think our returns were in the 20%, I guess, in FY21, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1363)|
| 0:22:54| So you look at the ACFR and 20% to 30% returns, everything looks great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1374)|
| 0:23:03| But historically, you try to get to that 7% number, and if you get to that number, that's where you're steady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1383)|
| 0:23:10| I would say the one closed plan that's not impacted by that per se by a number is the school's closed EB plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1390)|
| 0:23:18| because they went with a fixed rate for the next three or four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1398)|
| 0:23:26| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1406)|
| 0:23:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| Mr. Caldwell, page 21, this came up in a discussion the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1410)|
| 0:23:36| The central cafeteria fund, the way that's broken out, is that 100% of what the federal government returns to Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1416)|
| 0:23:48| So ultimately, legally, we have to adopt that fund, and it's probably a combination of federal funds and payees as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1428)|
| 0:24:01| So I think it's both going into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1441)|
| 0:24:05| But legally, it has to be adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1445)|
| 0:24:07| Okay, because that went up pretty dramatically, like $7 million, $6 million, $7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1447)|
| 0:24:11| If you go from budget to budget, it went from $27,360 to $27,855.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1451)|
| 0:24:17| I think what's getting everybody confused is the actual column.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| But ultimately, that probably was driven by COVID as well, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1460)|
| 0:24:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1465)|
| 0:24:26| And then on page 22, under the internal service funds, the caption for the building maintenance fund, is that our contribution to PBA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1466)|
| 0:24:39| So what that is, what goes into that fund is what we pay for county-owned buildings, electricity, water, gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1479)|
| 0:24:57| Am I forgetting anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1497)|
| 0:25:02| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1502)|
| 0:25:05| And then the rest would be the contribution to PBA for O&M, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1505)|
| 0:25:10| Okay, so do we actually pay that, or does PBA pay the utilities on those buildings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1510)|
| 0:25:15| We pay utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1515)|
| 0:25:21| Yeah, it's kind of split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1521)|
| 0:25:24| There are certain bills they pay and certain bills that we pay, but ultimately, we track everything in building maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1524)|
| 0:25:31| Okay, and then is schools incorporated in the same dollar figure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1531)|
| 0:25:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1535)|
| 0:25:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1536)|
| 0:25:37| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1537)|
| 0:25:38| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1538)|
| 0:25:39| Mr. Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1539)|
| 0:25:40| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1540)|
| 0:25:42| Mr. Caldwell, I kind of have a little bit of a crystal ball question, but you and I have had a lot of conversations in the last two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1542)|
| 0:25:49| When I first got on commission, we had a conversation a long time ago about, you know, we could see the city tax increase coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1549)|
| 0:25:58| It was pretty obvious from two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| Everybody estimated it to be around 15% to 25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1560)|
| 0:26:03| It landed right in the middle, right at 20%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1563)|
| 0:26:06| Right now, as a county, we do a very good job of managing our budget and everything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1566)|
| 0:26:10| but, you know, as a business owner and how I'm seeing the market, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1570)|
| 0:26:14| there's about a 30%, 40% increase to a lot of small business owners this year between fuel and issues with supply chains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1574)|
| 0:26:23| and everything else like that and people and trying to get people, I guess, as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1583)|
| 0:26:29| We've faced our own challenges here on commission with trying to find as much of an increase for teachers and for officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1589)|
| 0:26:35| and things about that, all in between of having a housing crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1595)|
| 0:26:39| We don't have enough houses for our people, and we also, you know, there's multiple challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1599)|
| 0:26:46| You know, we need to pave more roads, all these kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| So I'm just saying, I'm asking, I guess, how do you see us looking going from this year into next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1610)|
| 0:26:59| Do you still think that we're in a healthy spot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1619)|
| 0:27:02| From what I looked at, yes, right now we look healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1622)|
| 0:27:06| It's hard to determine with, you know, are we staring down a recession in the next couple months or this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1626)|
| 0:27:13| And how long do these fuel and supply chain issues last?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| And it's really hard to â€“ the crystal ball is a lot murkier than it was five years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1636)|
| 0:27:21| It would be a lot easier to project out then than it is to project out now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1641)|
| 0:27:24| I guess my question would be better framed as do you see any red flags currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1644)|
| 0:27:31| where we're trending towards a tax increase having to happen because of going red,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1651)|
| 0:27:36| or currently are there no red flags popping up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1656)|
| 0:27:40| I just want to be as responsible as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| If there are warning signs now, I'd like the commission to know about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1663)|
| 0:27:47| So maybe it's not next year or the year after, but five, eight years down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1667)|
| 0:27:51| we need to prepare for, you know, making some changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1671)|
| 0:27:57| I think ultimately, you know, I think any time there's inflation at a rate that we've saw the last three or four months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1677)|
| 0:28:07| that's very concerning, and how does one kind of prepare for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1687)|
| 0:28:18| It's a challenge because, you know, to a point, on the sales tax side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1698)|
| 0:28:24| you actually benefit from inflation to a certain point, but then where's that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1704)|
| 0:28:28| and where's the breaking point to where it falls off, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1708)|
| 0:28:31| And we obviously haven't hit the falling off part yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1711)|
| 0:28:35| We are amazed over a month that there's increases in local option sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1715)|
| 0:28:44| I think the one thing that we've done really well that prepares us for the next economic downturn, per se,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1724)|
| 0:28:57| a recession is we've built up really healthy reserves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1737)|
| 0:29:02| You've heard me talk about that, you know, we appreciate the commission that you all approved a few years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1742)|
| 0:29:11| a fund balance policy for us and the general fund of three months' worth of expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1751)|
| 0:29:17| We currently have between four and five months' worth of expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1757)|
| 0:29:21| Now, you know, short-sightedness would say, let's spin that down, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1761)|
| 0:29:29| But ultimately what you want to do is you also want to have the ability to withstand any downturn that comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1769)|
| 0:29:38| without hurting our citizens from a services standpoint, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1778)|
| 0:29:42| And so I think we're in a good spot to where when the downturn comes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1782)|
| 0:29:47| we have enough in reserves to where we can keep services where they need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1787)|
| 0:29:53| And we've been able to build up our reserves, okay, keep overall debt as a percentage of the budget going down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1793)|
| 0:30:08| all in while giving teachers a 12% raise the last four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1808)|
| 0:30:14| officers a 17% raise in the last four years with $6,500 in bonuses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1814)|
| 0:30:20| and county employees, you know, whatever that amount number is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1820)|
| 0:30:25| I think what you do is in the good times, yeah, you can do some things like pay and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1825)|
| 0:30:36| But you also, we've quietly built up reserves, which protect us when the downturn happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1836)|
| 0:30:45| And so are there red flags?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1845)|
| 0:30:49| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1849)|
| 0:30:50| I mean, so it's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1850)|
| 0:30:51| So I think any person, and you all see it too, you watch the news, you see economic stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1851)|
| 0:30:59| and you're just like, you know, it's coming, right, it's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1859)|
| 0:31:03| But then you also then see reports of leading economic indicators that show everything that has predicted any recession| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1863)|
| 0:31:17| all still show green if it's a red light system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| So it doesn't make sense, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| But also we're coming out of a pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1884)|
| 0:31:29| We have major supply chain issues, high inflation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1889)|
| 0:31:32| There's a lot of federal money in the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1892)|
| 0:31:35| I don't, you know, in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| I don't know if we've ever been at a place like this in our history to know that we do know what's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1897)|
| 0:31:45| And so I just think for us, we'd be diligent, which we appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1905)|
| 0:31:52| And that's what the mayor, you know, he charges me what's the most diligent thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1912)|
| 0:31:59| And what we think, while this budget shows a $60 million increase budget over budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1919)|
| 0:32:05| it's truly not that big when you look at actuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1925)|
| 0:32:09| But it still shows growth, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1929)|
| 0:32:11| It still shows growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1931)|
| 0:32:13| And I think it's important for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1933)|
| 0:32:15| We thought we did a really good job of using ARPA funds wisely and trying to piggyback off some of the state stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1935)|
| 0:32:23| I know that Mr. Snowden is working to help us more in TPO than where we've been in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1943)|
| 0:32:31| And then that helps us on the infrastructure side of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1951)|
| 0:32:35| And as well, as these infrastructure grants start coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| he's got his consultant on standby looking at ways we can take advantage of infrastructure grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1958)|
| 0:32:44| And so long-winded answer to your question, I mean, you're on pension board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1964)|
| 0:32:50| so I think it's important to know our pension plans are 70% to 90% funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1970)|
| 0:32:58| So we don't have a pension problem like you would see in Illinois or California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1978)|
| 0:33:07| And so we're really in a good spot from that standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1987)|
| 0:33:11| and I think our reserves help us when that downturn comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1991)|
| 0:33:18| Thanks, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1998)|
| 0:33:19| Thanks, Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=1999)|
| 0:33:22| Further questions, Commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=2002)|
| 0:33:25| Mr. Schoonmaker, you have the floor, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| I didn't want to make this a habit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=2007)|
| 0:33:30| Mr. Caldwell, page 23 under the revenue, under the general fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=2010)|
| 0:33:37| when you referenced in the finance committee meeting the loss of income from the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=2017)|
| 0:33:42| and the federal government for housing of prisoners, is that where the decrease is on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=2022)|
| 0:33:50| Will you see those numbers there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| So if you look, you know, it's strange from this standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=2032)|
| 0:33:58| You look at feds, and you see, here's one thing to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=2038)|
| 0:34:07| Look at, in this case, look at actual of 21 for state, which is like 12.8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=2047)|
| 0:34:14| You see that number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=2054)|
| 0:34:15| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=2055)|
| 0:34:16| And go all the way across, and what is proposed for 23 for state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=2056)|
| 0:34:20| 9.1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=2060)|
| 0:34:21| So that's not all state inmate, but it's driven heavy by state inmate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=2061)|
| 0:34:26| and then the state grants that we talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| Then you go on down, and you see federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=2068)|
| 0:34:31| You see it goes from 3 million down to 1.6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=2071)|
| 0:34:35| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=2075)|
| 0:34:36| That's where those two are, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=2076)|
| 0:34:38| And the federal money would be from just grants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=2078)|
| 0:34:41| Federal inmates, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| Federal inmates only?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=2083)|
| 0:34:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=2084)|
| 0:34:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=2085)|
| 0:34:46| Now, one good thing that the state, I shouldn't say that that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| Let me rephrase my way I said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| The state really helped us this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=2090)|
| 0:34:53| They raised the federal inmate money $2 from either 38 to 40 or 39 to 41.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=2093)|
| 0:35:00| And so whatever $2 that is, that's a help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=2100)|
| 0:35:04| Now, we would like that to get up to what it actually cost us per inmate, which is about 80.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=2104)|
| 0:35:11| But that's a step in the right direction, and we appreciate everything that we get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220516-public-budget-hearing?start=2111)|
