| 0:02:42| heart goes out to Father Stratus and the parishioners at St. George's Creek Orthodox Church for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=162)|

| 0:03:04| helped save a lot of the artifacts from the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=184)|

| 0:03:15| and they were most grateful of the pouring of support from throughout the community and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=195)|
| 0:03:20| also in the great work of our firefighters and we're glad that our one firefighter is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=200)|
| 0:03:25| doing all right who had a slight injury, but anyway, just everybody remember them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=205)|
| 0:03:30| They are accepting donations and their church website is stgeorgenoxville.com, so if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=210)|
| 0:03:39| would like to make a donation to them, I know they would very much appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=219)|

| 0:03:47| I also want to thank all the council members and city staff for coming out on Saturday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=227)|
| 0:03:52| to help with the River Rescue and the Tennessee River Tour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=232)|

| 0:09:46| Thank you very much, Robbie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=586)|
| 0:09:47| Vice Mayor Pavlis, do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=587)|
| 0:09:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=590)|
| 0:09:51| I want to remind everybody that our fourth...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=591)|
| 0:09:54| Oh, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=594)|
| 0:09:55| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=595)|
| 0:09:56| I was going to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=596)|
| 0:09:57| Did you have a question about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=597)|
| 0:09:58| Okay, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=598)|
| 0:09:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=599)|
| 0:10:00| I want to thank you and also Avis Reed and Lisa Chambers, our staff, and the whole board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=600)|
| 0:10:07| Rosa, yeah, you need to get to sitting in the middle next time so we can all see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=607)|
| 0:10:13| But thank you all for your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=613)|
| 0:10:15| Robbie, if you work, please share with the entire board that we appreciate the work that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=615)|
| 0:10:19| they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=619)|
| 0:10:20| And let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=620)|
| 0:10:21| Councilman Della Vopi has a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=621)|
| 0:10:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=622)|
| 0:10:23| Just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=623)|
| 0:10:24| Do you see any change in the nature of the complaints you're getting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=624)|
| 0:10:27| You talked about resolving 100 cases and 103 new ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=627)|
| 0:10:31| Is there any change in either the complexity or the orientation of the complaints?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=631)|
| 0:10:37| Not really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=637)|
| 0:10:39| It seems like this year we've seen a lot less racial profiling cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=639)|
| 0:10:43| I'm just on that committee chair, so that's a good thing, especially for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=643)|
| 0:10:48| But overall, it's sort of flat on each of the different committee members or committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=648)|
| 0:10:54| I know there's so many transactions that someone's obviously going to be unhappy from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=654)|
| 0:10:58| time to time, and that's a good reason for you guys to be there to sort of resolve them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=658)|
| 0:11:03| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=663)|
| 0:11:04| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=664)|
| 0:11:05| With the millions of one-on-ones that our police department has every year, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=665)|
| 0:11:08| to have 104 complaints that we review, it's fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=668)|
| 0:11:11| Now, I assume this will be available on our city website?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=671)|
| 0:11:16| It is currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=676)|
| 0:11:17| It is currently on the city website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=677)|
| 0:11:19| So we go to, where would that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=679)|
| 0:11:21| The park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=681)|
| 0:11:22| Go to the park page?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=682)|
| 0:11:24| You can search park on the city of Knoxville's website, and it takes you to our page that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=684)|
| 0:11:26| in the top right corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=686)|
| 0:11:27| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=687)|
| 0:11:28| So anybody who wants to see this full report, please check the website or call 311 if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=688)|
| 0:11:33| have any trouble finding it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=693)|
| 0:11:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=694)|
| 0:11:35| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=695)|
| 0:11:36| Thank you so much, Robbie and Rosa, Avis, and Lisa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=696)|
| 0:11:38| We appreciate all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=698)|
| 0:11:40| And now we have, before we get to the council reports, the final funding report on debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=700)|
| 0:11:46| obligation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=706)|
| 0:11:47| Bo Cole is going to present this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=707)|
| 0:11:49| This is required by the state, I believe, to do in a formal part of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=709)|
| 0:11:54| Bo Cole, city controller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=714)|
| 0:11:57| As council may recall, when the e-citation system was approved, there was money necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=717)|
| 0:12:04| to fund the acquisition of the equipment and to get the project off the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=724)|
| 0:12:08| At the time, council approved a loan from the general fund to the special revenue fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=728)|
| 0:12:13| in the amount of $800,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=733)|
| 0:12:16| Unfortunately, the equipment is only going to cost approximately $600,000, and we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=736)|
| 0:12:21| able to use existing cash flows to offset the borrowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=741)|
| 0:12:25| So the net borrowing from the general fund is going to be closer to $478,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=745)|
| 0:12:32| This probably $122,000 in cash flow is being used to reduce that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=752)|
| 0:12:38| The loan is going to be repaid within three years at 4% interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=758)|
| 0:12:44| If you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=764)|
| 0:12:46| Councilman Della Vopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=766)|
| 0:12:47| Yeah, do you have any results yet from the use of the system so you can measure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=767)|
| 0:12:52| against your projected three-year payback?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=772)|
| 0:12:55| I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=775)|
| 0:12:57| Do you have any results from the actual use of the system to see how that would play out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=777)|
| 0:13:02| in terms of your projected payback period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=782)|
| 0:13:04| It's still being put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=784)|
| 0:13:06| I don't know if any of it's been online yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=786)|
| 0:13:09| Go ahead, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=789)|
| 0:13:12| Councilman, the actual e-citation system is not active yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=792)|
| 0:13:16| The funding is coming from $5 that's put on to every citation that's written now, so we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=796)|
| 0:13:22| already bringing that money in just for regular citations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=802)|
| 0:13:24| So there's a cash flow already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=804)|
| 0:13:26| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=806)|
| 0:13:27| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=807)|
| 0:13:28| Yeah, $5 per citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=808)|
| 0:13:31| Okay, I think that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=811)|
| 0:13:34| Thank you very much, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=814)|
| 0:13:36| Okay, so now reports to Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=816)|
| 0:13:38| Vice Mayor Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=818)|
| 0:13:39| I'm sorry for jumping the gun there a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=819)|
| 0:13:41| I just wanted to remind everybody we have our fourth annual Council retreat this Saturday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=821)|
| 0:13:47| rescheduled from a snowy February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=827)|
| 0:13:49| It begins at 8 o'clock and will conclude at noon, and of course the public is welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=829)|
| 0:13:56| It's at the United Way Building at 1301 Hannah Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=836)|
| 0:14:01| So we look forward to yet another great retreat for the Council members and mayors joining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=841)|
| 0:14:08| us this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=848)|
| 0:14:09| I hope her voice is better by then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=849)|
| 0:14:12| I'd just like to talk a little bit, you know, very briefly about Cumberland Avenue since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=852)|
| 0:14:18| we've met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=858)|
| 0:14:19| It has, you know, construction has begun, and you know, as we anticipated, there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=859)|
| 0:14:27| some inconveniences, as there would be with any major construction project as such, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=867)|
| 0:14:35| you know, the one thing that I have really good feeling for on this one is that, unlike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=875)|
| 0:14:42| Chapman, it's not completely closed down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| So I mean, it's, you know, you can move, you can traverse it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=884)|
| 0:14:48| I want to let people know, too, that UT Federal Credit Union has been gracious enough to step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=888)|
| 0:14:56| up and allow folks who want to come to Cumberland Avenue from after hours, from 5 to say 6 a.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=896)|
| 0:15:05| to use their parking lot to be able to park there and walk to the various venues there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=905)|
| 0:15:12| And then we also have an agreement at 19th and White Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=912)|
| 0:15:16| It's behind where the old 10-roof restaurant and lounge used to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=916)|
| 0:15:22| It's a surface parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=922)|
| 0:15:23| We have an agreement with Covenant, with Fort Sanders Regional there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=923)|
| 0:15:28| They've been gracious enough to allow us to use that, too, on after hours from 5 until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=928)|
| 0:15:33| 6 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=933)|
| 0:15:34| I urge you to be cautious if it's after 6 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=934)|
| 0:15:37| Your car may end up someplace you don't want it to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=937)|
| 0:15:42| So those are two great avenues for you to go in there and be able to, you know, go wherever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=942)|
| 0:15:50| you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=950)|
| 0:15:51| It's free parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=951)|
| 0:15:52| So that will certainly help the process along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=952)|
| 0:15:58| I had a conversation with Mr. Hagerman earlier, and his team has been out there monitoring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=958)|
| 0:16:04| the flow of traffic at peak hours in the morning and afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=964)|
| 0:16:09| They're tweaking the signalization there to optimize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=969)|
| 0:16:16| You know, it's going to take just a little while for us to figure out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=976)|
| 0:16:21| But like Chapman Highway, we're all humans, and we'll figure out the best and most convenient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=981)|
| 0:16:26| way for us to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=986)|
| 0:16:28| So again, I want to urge you, I must be the road closure king, but remember these merchants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=988)|
| 0:16:34| and all the venues around Cumberland Avenue, and go and support them, particularly, I asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=994)|
| 0:16:40| my folks on the south side of the bridge, the other side of the 1st District, to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1000)|
| 0:16:46| help your brother and sister out during their hard time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1006)|
| 0:16:50| And Cumberland Avenue is open for business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1010)|
| 0:16:53| You'll be hearing that a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1013)|
| 0:16:55| I was hoping we would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1015)|
| 0:16:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1019)|
| 0:17:00| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1022)|
| 0:17:03| I wanted to make an announcement of a community meeting that will be held this Thursday, April| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1023)|
| 0:17:08| the 16th, at the Beck Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1028)|
| 0:17:12| And that meeting will be hosted by Representative Joseph Armstrong, County Commissioner Sam| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1032)|
| 0:17:19| McKenzie, Gloria Deafridge, and myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1039)|

| 0:22:28| No, I just wanted to say if any of my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1348)|
| 0:22:30| have an opportunity to go by and look at the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1350)|
| 0:22:32| this is a real good example of a pocket park that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1352)|
| 0:22:35| being developed in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1355)|
| 0:22:37| And if you recall, this was, or used to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1357)|
| 0:22:40| a gas station sitting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| And when TDOT took over the property in order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1362)|
| 0:22:44| to expand the bridge, that left that one corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1364)|
| 0:22:47| that one piece there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| And so with the city's help and with TDOT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1369)|
| 0:22:52| we're able to really develop a pocket park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1372)|
| 0:22:54| And hopefully, with the help of everyone coming up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1374)|
| 0:22:58| that we'll be able to go ahead and have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1378)|

| 0:25:31| I know she's in the back corner up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1531)|
| 0:25:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1533)|
| 0:25:39| While you're coming down, I'll ask my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1539)|
| 0:25:41| This is, I guess, the first three of maybe 21| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1541)|
| 0:25:45| of these vans that have special features to get folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1545)|
| 0:25:52| around the paratransit vans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1552)|
| 0:25:55| Do you have some estimate of the total budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1555)|
| 0:25:58| over the next several years that we're going to be doing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1558)|
| 0:26:03| The vans themselves, the maximum comes to about just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1563)|
| 0:26:07| under $62,000 per van.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1567)|
| 0:26:10| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1570)|
| 0:26:12| And we're going to do 21 of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1572)|
| 0:26:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1573)|
| 0:26:14| I don't have the math all done out for that, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1574)|
| 0:26:17| And it's split between us and the feds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1577)|
| 0:26:20| or how does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| What we do is this is 5,307 funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1582)|
| 0:26:24| And what happens is that comes out to 80%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1584)|
| 0:26:28| That's FTA from those funds, and then 10% city match,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1588)|
| 0:26:31| as well as 10% from TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1591)|

| 0:26:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1596)|
| 0:26:37| I have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1599)|
| 0:26:39| I know you always look left, but I know last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1599)|
| 0:26:44| I wanted to, I know last year, I think we, just remind me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1604)|
| 0:26:49| we had a, we passed a resolution to combine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1609)|
| 0:26:54| buying power for K-Trans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1614)|
| 0:26:56| Is that, or didn't we decide, didn't we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1616)|
| 0:27:01| combine our buying power for, what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1621)|
| 0:27:06| didn't we pass some resolution last year to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| And I just wondered if that was, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| were able to take advantage of this on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1630)|
| 0:27:11| and how we're going to take this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1631)|
| 0:27:13| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1633)|
| 0:27:13| We're actually still working on two different procurements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1633)|
| 0:27:18| that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1638)|
| 0:27:19| And our one procurement is for our larger buses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1639)|
| 0:27:22| which is our 35-foot and 40-foot buses, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| will allow us better buying power for those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1644)|
| 0:27:28| as well as we have what we call mid-size vehicles, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1648)|
| 0:27:32| are like low floor, a little bit bigger than vans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1652)|
| 0:27:35| a little smaller than buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| So yes, we are working on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| But that didn't help us in this, or in this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| That's not this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1663)|
| 0:27:44| That's why I wanted to make sure I have our,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1664)|
| 0:27:48| right, this size vehicle, as I was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1668)|
| 0:27:52| is not allowed to buy the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1672)|
| 0:27:55| So this purchase itself is not under that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1675)|
| 0:27:58| However, we have two more that should be coming up pretty soon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1678)|
| 0:28:02| that we did put that power together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| to allow us with other transit companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| to purchase those at better prices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1688)|
| 0:28:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150414?start=1690)|
