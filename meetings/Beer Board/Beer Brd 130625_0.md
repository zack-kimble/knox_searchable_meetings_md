| 0:00:28| announcements from the chair here to kind of make this meeting go along a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=28)|
| 0:00:33| little bit better. Applicants who have all their paperwork submitted and their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=33)|
| 0:00:37| permit is approved tonight can pick up their permits for Ms. Day at the end of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=37)|
| 0:00:42| the meeting. We have a really full agenda. There's only one Ms. Day. Her assistant's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=42)|
| 0:00:46| not here so to keep the meeting going and keep her from losing her mind and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=46)|
| 0:00:51| help you get your permits if you will wait at the end of the meeting to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=51)|
| 0:00:55| her. If you have documentation that's not complete you'll need to bring that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=55)|
| 0:01:02| into the business office during regular business hours. When I call the name of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=62)|
| 0:01:07| the business applying for a permit please come to the podium, state your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=67)|
| 0:01:11| name, and address for the record. And the first one is a series of bread boxes and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=71)|
| 0:01:17| this one will be the one on Sutherland Avenue number 3470. This would be in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=77)|
| 0:01:24| Councilman Grieve's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=84)|
| 0:01:27| Deneen Graham, 370 East Drive Oak Ridge. Thank you. Sergeant Hunter? No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=87)|
| 0:01:34| Steyer? We're still needing the building inspection, fire prevention, and health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=94)|
| 0:01:39| department approvals and surrender of the former owner's spirit permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=99)|
| 0:01:42| Councilman Grieve? Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=102)|
| 0:01:46| Do you want to just sort of explain what's going on here? Pull your microphone down please we can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=106)|
| 0:01:52| Sorry. Would you repeat what you asked? Would you just sort of give a brief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=112)|
| 0:01:58| history on what's going on on these particular ones why they're here again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=118)|
| 0:02:00| Okay, there are six breadbox applications. The locations were at last month's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=120)|
| 0:02:06| meeting under a different ownership and were permitted subject to final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=126)|
| 0:02:11| documentation. The beer permits for the former owner remain in operation and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=131)|
| 0:02:18| beer permits for the new owner are waiting for the files to be completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=138)|
| 0:02:22| And in the case of 3470 they need the building inspection, fire prevention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=142)|
| 0:02:28| health department, and the surrender of the former owner beer permit. So am I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=148)|
| 0:02:33| correct that they will continue to operate under the old permit and the old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=153)|
| 0:02:36| owner until this is done? Is that right? Yes ma'am. Okay. But this is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=156)|
| 0:02:42| different owner than the one that came before us last time? Yes it is. So we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=162)|
| 0:02:46| a switch. Right. Okay. Just wanted to make sure that everybody understood that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=166)|
| 0:02:50| Thank you very much. Would you like now to? I will approve pending final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=170)|
| 0:02:54| documentation. All right. Is there a second? I'll second that, but I do have a question. Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=174)|
| 0:02:59| All of these managers, are they currently the managers of the existing business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=179)|
| 0:03:06| Yes, sir. I believe they are. So we're not really making a transition. We don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=186)|
| 0:03:11| to go through all the training and they've achieved all that already? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=191)|
| 0:03:16| I think the managers went with the new, stayed with the business. It was just the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=196)|
| 0:03:20| ownership change. Is that right? Yes. Okay. You're the one who's on the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=200)|
| 0:03:24| Yes. Okay. All right. So we have a motion and a second. Oh, I'm sorry. Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=204)|
| 0:03:30| I really got lost here. So the ones we did last time, they are still,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=210)|
| 0:03:38| these are different ones. These are different owners. Correct. The ones we did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=218)|
| 0:03:43| last time are still pending final documentation. Right. Ms. Tate, do you want to clarify this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=223)|
| 0:03:52| That's correct. We still have those in our office. They do want those beer permits released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=232)|
| 0:03:57| I think the sale date has been pushed forward, but they are going to pick up those permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=237)|
| 0:04:02| and Wurlsley is that ownership and they intend on going into business. And then I guess this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=242)|
| 0:04:07| ownership will follow. Okay. So how long do they sit there pending final documentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=247)|
| 0:04:17| How long is our approval good for? Ninety days. Ninety days. Right. And the inspections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=257)|
| 0:04:23| are being done as rapidly as they can be done. Some of it had to do with not notifying the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=263)|
| 0:04:29| inspection. There was some confusion with this change of ownership, I believe. And as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=269)|
| 0:04:34| a result, people who needed to be doing inspections weren't notified that they needed to do another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=274)|
| 0:04:39| inspection because there would be different ownership. So that notification has all happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=279)|
| 0:04:45| and is taking place, not as we speak, but today and probably tomorrow. The next thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=285)|
| 0:04:51| will be the former owner's beer permit. And I can assure you that Ms. Day will not let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=291)|
| 0:04:56| a new permit out the door until all those things are done. I have no doubt about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=296)|
| 0:05:03| Thank you. All right. Two things. Okay. Is it really necessary to have another inspection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=303)|
| 0:05:10| on when you have an existing active business and you're just transferring the law? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=310)|
| 0:05:15| Okay. That's just a rhetorical question. That's what the law requires. Even if there's no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=315)|
| 0:05:20| physical change? I mean, there's no, I mean, these beer permits are still active. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=320)|
| 0:05:25| a change of ownership that we are that we are considering. The permit for the new owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=325)|
| 0:05:32| So every new owner would have to have a set of inspections, just like they opened this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=332)|
| 0:05:38| store for the first time ever. Now, we may not be comfortable with that and we may want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=338)|
| 0:05:42| to address whether that's necessary or not. But at this moment, that's what the law says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=342)|
| 0:05:49| I totally believe that Ms. Day will not let this out until they're fully documented. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=349)|
| 0:05:54| still have a problem approving whatever we did, five or six last time, five or six more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=354)|
| 0:05:58| and I, they're all pending documentation. I mean, you know, get the work in or apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=358)|
| 0:06:04| for it when it's done. But that's okay. I'm sure they consider that. Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=364)|
| 0:06:11| I want to follow up with George. So basically, we have a business that has two permits pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=371)|
| 0:06:15| No. Yes. No. No. Yes. One permit. One. Pick one. Twelve different stores. So what happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=375)|
| 0:06:22| to the what happened to the six we approved pending final documentation last time? They| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=382)|
| 0:06:27| remain in our office, subject to final documentation. The owner that's there now is Transglobal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=387)|
| 0:06:33| Gas and Oil. And they have been in business for a number of years. And they are there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=393)|
| 0:06:37| right now. Okay. And Worldsley is going to go in and then the new folks behind them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=397)|
| 0:06:43| There's six there now, right? And there's six more tonight. It's two different. There's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=403)|
| 0:06:47| twelve applications. Correct. Thank you. I'm not very good at math. All right. Are we all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=407)|
| 0:06:56| Do you get your question answered, Councilman? Yeah. I just wanted to know if the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=416)|
| 0:06:59| hadn't changed, why don't we have the reinspection? But that's the law. So we're going with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=419)|
| 0:07:03| Okay. All right. Ms. Palmer. Yes. May I? Yes, you may. I'm here. The inspectors may not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=423)|
| 0:07:08| have to go back out and do another inspection. But we do send them the paperwork. And if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=428)|
| 0:07:14| they say, well, hey, I was just there two weeks ago, then they'll just send documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=434)|
| 0:07:18| to us that they're okay. Which will expedite all of this. Yes, ma'am. The big thing will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=438)|
| 0:07:23| be to get the beer permits from Transglobal into the office so that the new permit can be issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=443)|
| 0:07:31| Assuming that we approve this application. Are we getting double fees? I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=451)|
| 0:07:40| Are we getting double fees? I'm sorry. Are we getting double fees? I mean, the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=460)|
| 0:07:44| group paid fees and this group is paying fees. Yes, sir. So we're getting paid for all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=464)|
| 0:07:47| Yes, sir. Okay. Oh, yes. Yes. Does that make you feel better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=467)|
| 0:07:51| It's 12 different applications. Not double. These are new math guidance. I know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=471)|
| 0:07:57| Thank you. Councilman Wallace, we'll look to you for math guidance. All right. Now that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=477)|

| 0:11:36| Moved to approve pending final documentation. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=696)|
| 0:11:39| All those in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=699)|
| 0:11:41| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=701)|
| 0:11:42| Ms. Carolla, make sure that you do get that permit so that you can surrender| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=702)|
| 0:11:47| so that you can get your new permit and get open and have it generated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=707)|
| 0:11:51| We're driving tonight to Nashville to go get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=711)|
| 0:11:53| Okay. Great. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=713)|
| 0:11:55| All right. The next one is, let me see, I believe it's the Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=715)|
| 0:12:06| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=726)|
| 0:12:08| Yeah, the Hill on 1105 Forest Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=728)|
| 0:12:11| This is an application for a special event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=731)|
| 0:12:17| Trevor Hill, 1105 Forest Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=737)|
| 0:12:20| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=740)|
| 0:12:21| Before we begin, are you a 501c3 or a other non-profit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=741)|
| 0:12:26| We are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=746)|
| 0:12:27| It was just going to be a block party to start with because it's a dead end road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=747)|
| 0:12:31| And since it has grown into something that it was not originally intended to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=751)|
| 0:12:36| we have joined up with Second Harvest Food Bank and Greg LaRose to collect cans for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=756)|
| 0:12:44| because they have such a hard time collecting food during the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=764)|
| 0:12:50| And that's kind of where we stand with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=770)|
| 0:12:52| Okay. Well, you are not a non-profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=772)|
| 0:12:53| And under the ordinance, only non-profits can have special event permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=773)|
| 0:12:58| two per year, calendar year, and one day each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=778)|
| 0:13:02| So you are not eligible to apply for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=782)|
| 0:13:06| And if you're going to team up with a non-profit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=786)|
| 0:13:09| they are the ones who will need to make the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=789)|
| 0:13:12| So you're not going to let any non-profits do special events anymore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=792)|
| 0:13:16| That's not what I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=796)|
| 0:13:18| The non-profit has to be the one who makes the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=798)|
| 0:13:21| So for-profits are not allowed to do special events anymore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=801)|
| 0:13:24| They've never been allowed to do special events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=804)|
| 0:13:27| Section 4-77 of the Part 3, Chapter 4 of the Code of Ordinances outlines that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=807)|
| 0:13:34| Mr. Frost, could you explain that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=814)|
| 0:13:36| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=816)|
| 0:13:37| Actually, there are different types of permits available for Naland Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=817)|
| 0:13:43| World's Fair Park, and Market Square, where I don't believe you have to be a non-profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=823)|
| 0:13:49| But 4-77A, the city is authorized to issue special occasion licenses to bona fide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=829)|
| 0:13:58| charitable, non-profit, or political organizations for special events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=838)|
| 0:14:05| Then the next sentence talks about the exception of events for Second Creek Redevelopment Site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=845)|
| 0:14:10| which I believe folks will recognize as World's Fair Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=850)|
| 0:14:13| and it talks about special occasion license shall not be issued for longer than one 24-hour period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=853)|
| 0:14:23| The paperwork, the application should include, I believe, the information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=863)|
| 0:14:30| including the letter of determination of the non-profit, unless it is some sort of political organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=870)|
| 0:14:39| I've read all that paperwork, and nowhere in there does it actually say that they can't give one to a for-profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=879)|
| 0:14:47| Where does it say that you actually cannot issue one to a for-profit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=887)|
| 0:14:51| It's to be authorized to issue special occasion licenses to bona fide, charitable, non-profit, or political organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=891)|
| 0:15:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=903)|
| 0:15:07| So then what would you recommend we do to have a block party?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=907)|
| 0:15:11| Well, we're not in a position, nor do we provide legal advice to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=911)|
| 0:15:17| We'll politely and respectfully point them in the direction of the city beer ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=917)|
| 0:15:28| Well, we've had them there before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=928)|
| 0:15:30| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=930)|
| 0:15:32| I will review them in depth, and we'll figure out a way to make it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=932)|
| 0:15:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=938)|
| 0:15:39| Councilman Delevaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=939)|
| 0:15:40| Yeah, I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=940)|
| 0:15:41| This gentleman, you have this teed up for January 28th, so this coming weekend through the 30th, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=941)|
| 0:15:47| June 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=947)|
| 0:15:48| Yeah, this coming weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| We'll just keep it in the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=950)|
| 0:15:51| I mean, it's not a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=951)|
| 0:15:53| We'll keep it on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=953)|
| 0:15:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=955)|
| 0:15:56| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=956)|
| 0:15:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=957)|
| 0:15:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=958)|
| 0:15:59| When he submitted his application, was he told this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=959)|
| 0:16:02| He did receive the paperwork, a copy of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=962)|
| 0:16:05| He did receive a copy of this when he turned his application in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=965)|
| 0:16:07| Well, I've read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=967)|
| 0:16:08| Like I said, it says that you can issue it to those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=968)|
| 0:16:10| It doesn't say you cannot issue it to a for-profit anywhere in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=970)|
| 0:16:14| I'm not arguing over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=974)|
| 0:16:15| I just wanted to see whether this was the first he heard about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=975)|
| 0:16:19| No, it was not the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=979)|
| 0:16:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=981)|
| 0:16:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=982)|
| 0:16:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=983)|
| 0:16:24| Councilman Delevaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=984)|
| 0:16:25| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=985)|
| 0:16:26| I had the light on from before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=986)|
| 0:16:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=987)|
| 0:16:29| Do we need a motion to deny?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=989)|
| 0:16:32| Do we need no motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=992)|
| 0:16:33| No motion would suffice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=993)|
| 0:16:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=995)|
| 0:16:38| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=998)|
| 0:16:39| Hearing no motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=999)|
| 0:16:41| Would that allow us to apply under a different pretext?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1001)|
| 0:16:45| I think that you should be fairly honest when you apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1005)|
| 0:16:48| and not pretend to be something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1008)|
| 0:16:50| If you have a nonprofit organization that would like to use your facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1010)|
| 0:16:55| then they need to be the ones who apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1015)|
| 0:16:57| And I just said when we originally applied, we had not partnered up with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1017)|
| 0:17:01| That's come at a later date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1021)|
| 0:17:03| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1023)|
| 0:17:04| That's come later, that we have now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1024)|
| 0:17:06| that they've asked us if we would collect food for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1026)|
| 0:17:09| That came after the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1029)|
| 0:17:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1030)|
| 0:17:11| So that would be, we were completely honest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1031)|
| 0:17:13| and I've told you just now that we applied after the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1033)|
| 0:17:16| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1036)|
| 0:17:17| You are welcome to reapply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1037)|
| 0:17:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1039)|
| 0:17:20| That's all I need to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1040)|
| 0:17:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1041)|
| 0:17:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1042)|
| 0:17:23| Do we have to pay it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1043)|
| 0:17:24| Or do we have to repay the fee again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1044)|
| 0:17:26| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1046)|
| 0:17:27| Actually, there's a provision in the Bureau permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1047)|
| 0:17:30| where there's prohibited by ordinance of refunding any application fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1050)|
| 0:17:37| So you're filing a new permit, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1057)|
| 0:17:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1060)|
| 0:17:41| All righty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1061)|
| 0:17:42| Well, thank you all for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1062)|
| 0:17:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1063)|
| 0:17:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1064)|
| 0:17:45| Next is Plum Tree Restaurant on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1065)|
| 0:17:48| This would be in Councilman Grieve's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1068)|
| 0:17:50| I happen to have lost my phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1070)|
| 0:17:52| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1072)|
| 0:17:53| While they're on their way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| Lost Patronis has withdrawn the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1075)|
| 0:17:58| We need to do nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1078)|
| 0:18:00| Well, we have it on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1080)|
| 0:18:02| I think we have a motion to withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1082)|
| 0:18:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1084)|
| 0:18:05| Do we have a motion to withdraw Lost Patronis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1085)|
| 0:18:08| Except the withdrawal, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1088)|
| 0:18:10| Except the withdrawal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1090)|
| 0:18:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1091)|
| 0:18:13| All those in favor of approving the withdrawal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1093)|
| 0:18:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1096)|
| 0:18:17| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1097)|
| 0:18:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1098)|
| 0:18:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1099)|
| 0:18:20| Now, Plum Tree Restaurant, name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1100)|

| 0:18:29| Files complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1109)|
| 0:18:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1110)|
| 0:18:31| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1111)|
| 0:18:32| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1112)|

| 0:18:41| Pick up your permit at the end of this meeting for Ms. Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1121)|

| 0:20:00| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1200)|

| 0:20:02| Vials complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1202)|
| 0:20:03| Okay, do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1203)|
| 0:20:05| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1205)|
| 0:20:07| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1207)|
| 0:20:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1208)|
| 0:20:09| All right, can you tell us a little bit about SoulJam?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1209)|
| 0:20:10| It starts at five o'clock, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1210)|
| 0:20:13| That's when the gates open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1213)|
| 0:20:14| The show starts at 6.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1214)|
| 0:20:16| This is our third annual, so I've been here before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1216)|
| 0:20:20| But we're having entertainment for the adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1220)|
| 0:20:23| I have a poster here and I have some flyers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1223)|
| 0:20:25| that you all can also see at your desk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1225)|
| 0:20:28| But we're having three different bands that will be coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1228)|
| 0:20:32| I don't know if any of you are familiar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1232)|
| 0:20:34| with Mars Day at the Time, Silk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| and a local band called After Party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1237)|
| 0:20:40| And they play a lot of jazz and blues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1240)|
| 0:20:43| and R&B, soulful music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1243)|
| 0:20:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1246)|
| 0:20:48| Councilman Brown, are you listening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| Yes, I am listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1250)|
| 0:20:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1251)|
| 0:20:52| And we know who Mars Day is too, don't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1252)|
| 0:20:54| We know who he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1256)|
| 0:20:57| All right, do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1257)|
| 0:20:59| We already did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1259)|
| 0:21:00| Okay, well, you're good to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1260)|
| 0:21:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1262)|
| 0:21:03| All right, the next one is the Tobacco King on Broadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1263)|
| 0:21:10| and they've asked to be deferred to July 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1270)|
| 0:21:15| Move to postpone until July 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1275)|
| 0:21:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1277)|
| 0:21:18| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1278)|
| 0:21:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1279)|
| 0:21:20| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| All right, we now come to the administrative hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1284)|
| 0:21:27| Oh, I'm sorry, we had an addendum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1287)|
| 0:21:30| and that was a Weichel's application for a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1290)|
| 0:21:34| They're withdrawing that application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1294)|
| 0:21:37| They have some issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1297)|
| 0:21:38| will not be building at that site for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1298)|
| 0:21:41| So when they get that worked out, they will resubmit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| Now let's go to the hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1303)|
| 0:21:45| We have five of these tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1305)|
| 0:21:48| The first one is the Tin Roof on Cumberland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1308)|
| 0:21:57| Good evening, Chair Promos, Steve Meisner, Nashville Bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1317)|
| 0:22:00| I'm here for Tin Roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1320)|
| 0:22:01| I have Mr. Denbeck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1321)|
| 0:22:01| he's the general manager of that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1321)|
| 0:22:03| Okay, just before we begin this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1323)|
| 0:22:06| this is the second violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| within a two-year city rule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1328)|
| 0:22:10| the third violation, because TABC goes for three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1330)|
| 0:22:15| The Tin Roof has submitted a comprehensive remedial plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1335)|
| 0:22:18| paid the fine, and let me ask you this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1338)|
| 0:22:21| Are you waiving the time provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| regarding suspension of your license for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1343)|
| 0:22:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1346)|
| 0:22:27| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1347)|
| 0:22:29| What this means is that they will go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1349)|
| 0:22:31| before the city hearing officer this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1351)|
| 0:22:35| and that they will begin a suspension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1355)|
| 0:22:37| as agreed with TABC on July the 1st through July 30th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1357)|
| 0:22:42| and that way everybody will be settled down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1362)|
| 0:22:44| We've had discussions on this beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1364)|
| 0:22:46| about the TABC issuing and our issuing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1366)|
| 0:22:51| and everybody doesn't dance at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| So this is a very good example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1374)|
| 0:22:55| and Mr. Meisner has been really pushing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1375)|
| 0:22:57| to help make this happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1377)|
| 0:22:59| that we work with TABC to see if we can make things happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1379)|
| 0:23:03| So the Tin Roof license then would be suspended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1383)|
| 0:23:06| July the 1st through the 30th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| and at the end of that time, a wholly retrained staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1388)|
| 0:23:12| because you've submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1392)|
| 0:23:13| quite a comprehensive retraining plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| Okay, and do you have other locations in the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1396)|
| 0:23:18| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1398)|
| 0:23:19| Do you use that same plan for all of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| We're starting to roll out a whole new policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1401)|
| 0:23:23| and procedure for all Tin Roof stores in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1403)|
| 0:23:25| Okay, well that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| So we don't need to act on this at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| It will be going forward from this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1409)|
| 0:23:32| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1412)|
| 0:23:33| Okay, thank you so much for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1415)|
| 0:23:44| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1424)|
| 0:23:45| We need to make a motion and a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1425)|
| 0:23:46| to send this to the revocation, or to the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1429)|
| 0:23:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1430)|
| 0:23:51| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1431)|
| 0:23:53| Okay, now we're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1433)|
| 0:23:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1434)|
| 0:23:54| All right, now as a reminder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1434)|
| 0:23:56| the remaining four folks on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1436)|
| 0:23:59| four permit holders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1439)|
| 0:24:02| they need to verify that the fine has been paid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1442)|
| 0:24:05| that they've submitted their remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1445)|
| 0:24:08| They'll have a total of five minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1448)|
| 0:24:09| to discuss what happened leading to the citation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1449)|
| 0:24:13| what they're going to do to be sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1453)|
| 0:24:15| that this never happens again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1455)|
| 0:24:17| If we're satisfied with their explanation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| and they've paid the fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1460)|
| 0:24:21| and they've submitted a plan that we're happy with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1461)|
| 0:24:24| then we can say thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| and hope that we don't see them again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1466)|
| 0:24:29| If we aren't satisfied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1469)|
| 0:24:30| then we can send them to a hearing officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1470)|
| 0:24:32| and that would require a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1472)|
| 0:24:34| Is everybody clear about how this will work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| Okay, we're kind of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1477)|
| 0:24:39| Yes, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1479)|
| 0:24:40| So the Tin Roof volunteered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1480)|
| 0:24:42| Yes, they volunteered, right, because...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| And we have to decide on this next four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1484)|
| 0:24:45| Well, we have to decide on the next four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1485)|
| 0:24:47| and the Tin Roof volunteered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1487)|
| 0:24:50| and it was really a good exercise for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1490)|
| 0:24:52| to see what we can do with the new law, so we're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1492)|
| 0:24:55| All right, the next business permit holder is Whiskey Dix,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1495)|
| 0:25:01| and they have not paid their fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1501)|
| 0:25:02| nor have they submitted a remedial plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1502)|
| 0:25:04| and this is a second violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1504)|
| 0:25:07| Three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1507)|
| 0:25:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1507)|
| 0:25:08| In three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1508)|
| 0:25:11| Would you give us your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| Freddie Gagley, 1912 Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1513)|
| 0:25:16| And what is your connection to Whiskey Dix?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1516)|
| 0:25:18| I'm the general manager there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1518)|
| 0:25:19| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1519)|
| 0:25:20| Could you explain to us what happened twice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1520)|
| 0:25:23| in a short period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| and how this will never happen again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1524)|
| 0:25:26| It is pretty much negligence on the bartender's half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1526)|
| 0:25:30| We have two security guards at the front door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1530)|
| 0:25:33| IDing everybody that comes in the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| We've actually worked with ABC on collecting fake IDs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1535)|
| 0:25:40| and they've actually issued a few citations there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1540)|
| 0:25:44| with that, trying to help with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1544)|
| 0:25:46| We've been working with them for the last week or two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1546)|
| 0:25:49| about this violation here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1549)|
| 0:25:51| and we're also under suspension with the ABC board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1551)|
| 0:25:57| This has kind of been shuffled back and forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1557)|
| 0:26:00| of who was actually going to take care of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1560)|
| 0:26:03| and I just actually got this today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1563)|
| 0:26:05| that I was going to be the one coming here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1565)|
| 0:26:06| and taking care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1566)|
| 0:26:07| But we have decided to go 21 and up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1567)|
| 0:26:13| ABC has actually talked to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1573)|
| 0:26:15| We've been verbally going back and forth with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1575)|
| 0:26:18| excuse me, on the best way to handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1578)|
| 0:26:22| We did let minors in between the ages of 18 and 21,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1582)|
| 0:26:26| and now we have decided after our suspension with ABC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| that we're going to go strictly 21 and up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1589)|
| 0:26:31| and we're going to stay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1591)|
| 0:26:34| Okay, how long is your TABC suspension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1594)|
| 0:26:39| When does it start and when does it end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1599)|
| 0:26:40| It started Monday, and it ends the 8th of July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1600)|
| 0:26:46| Okay, why did no one pay the fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1606)|
| 0:26:49| or submit a remedial plan to the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1609)|
| 0:26:52| as that letter instructed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1612)|
| 0:26:54| To be honest with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1614)|
| 0:26:56| I think it was a miscommunication between myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1616)|
| 0:26:57| and the owners of the establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1617)|
| 0:27:00| They actually handled it the first time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| on the remedies of what we were going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| to actually correct this in coordinates with myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1624)|
| 0:27:07| And we've been going back and forth with ABC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1627)|
| 0:27:10| myself and Mr. Eric, kind of shuffling back and forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1630)|
| 0:27:15| and then this was brought to my attention today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1635)|
| 0:27:17| that I need to come down here and take care of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1637)|
| 0:27:20| I do have a check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1640)|
| 0:27:21| I can go get it out of my vehicle to take care of this today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1641)|
| 0:27:24| and if I need to email or submit anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| that I need to do today, I'll be glad to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1647)|
| 0:27:31| Well, the letter was quite clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1651)|
| 0:27:33| that this needed to be taken care of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1653)|
| 0:27:34| before this meeting tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1654)|
| 0:27:36| and I understand that within the business operation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1656)|
| 0:27:39| there may be some confusion about who's making decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1659)|
| 0:27:42| and who is doing what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| It's within the power of this beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| to send this to the hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| If you have an ABC suspension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| it will be going to the hearing officer anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1671)|
| 0:27:53| Is that right, Ms. Sunter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1673)|
| 0:27:56| I haven't received any official notification of suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1676)|
| 0:27:59| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| So we have an option here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1683)|
| 0:28:05| Actually, the way I'm reading the statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| there is not an option under 4-78C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1687)|
| 0:28:17| It says, no less than three working days in advance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1697)|
| 0:28:21| of the scheduled administrative hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1701)|
| 0:28:24| which this is at the permit holder shall file| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1704)|
| 0:28:28| with the city recorder revised written remedial plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| explaining why it was not submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1710)|
| 0:28:34| If the fine has not been paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| by the time of the administrative hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1716)|
| 0:28:39| the law department shall file a noncompliance complaint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1719)|
| 0:28:42| against the permit holder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1722)|
| 0:28:44| and a suspension revocation hearing shall be conducted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1724)|
| 0:28:48| Okay, do we need a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1728)|
| 0:28:49| to ask the law department to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1729)|
| 0:28:51| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1731)|
| 0:28:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| All right, all those in favor of asking the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1734)|
| 0:28:55| to initiate proceedings say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1735)|
| 0:28:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1737)|
| 0:28:58| All right, Vice Mayor Pavlos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| I mean, I just want to say this is a disgrace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1740)|
| 0:29:03| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1743)|
| 0:29:04| You guys are disorganized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| It's the second time in three months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1746)|
| 0:29:08| and that's just totally unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| And you're on the spiral path of down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| and it's just not good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1752)|
| 0:29:13| I mean, I do not appreciate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1753)|
| 0:29:16| I think this is the first time that this has happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| If somebody hasn't taken this seriously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1758)|
| 0:29:22| and you guys are not taking this seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1762)|
| 0:29:26| So, I know you're not the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| I apologize on my behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1768)|
| 0:29:29| Well, I understand that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1769)|
| 0:29:30| but I just hope you take that back to the owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1770)|
| 0:29:33| because this is unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1773)|
| 0:29:35| I've been on the chopping block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1775)|
| 0:29:36| I completely understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1776)|
| 0:29:36| and I'm here today apologizing to you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1776)|
| 0:29:41| I 100%, that's why I suggested to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| that we went 21 and up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1783)|
| 0:29:45| I mean, I just wanted to move forward with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1785)|
| 0:29:48| All right, the law department will be in touch with the-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1788)|
| 0:29:51| Let me ask this, too, just out of curiosity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1791)|
| 0:29:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1794)|
| 0:29:55| Not to you, but the tin roof, they just left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1795)|
| 0:29:58| and they're doing it, that's the Cumberland, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1798)|
| 0:30:02| That's not the- Right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1802)|
| 0:30:03| that's the Cumberland store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1803)|
| 0:30:04| All right, so why can't we do it September 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1804)|
| 0:30:08| instead of July?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1808)|
| 0:30:09| I mean, why does it have to be the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1809)|
| 0:30:11| when nobody's doing any business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1811)|
| 0:30:13| I mean, they're gonna be 4th of July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| and there's nobody there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| I don't think it's-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1817)|
| 0:30:19| Well, TABC sets their suspension dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1819)|
| 0:30:22| So we gotta go by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1822)|
| 0:30:24| We went for that. Concurrent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1824)|
| 0:30:26| Right, now, if we can't get this worked out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1826)|
| 0:30:29| to hear them, our suspension dates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1829)|
| 0:30:31| may come after the TABC dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| But when I talk with them this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1834)|
| 0:30:37| I will be asking about looking at a time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1837)|
| 0:30:40| when it will be very meaningful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1840)|
| 0:30:41| as opposed to a time when there's virtually no business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1841)|
| 0:30:45| because there aren't very many students here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| So I appreciate your concerns, and those are mine also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1847)|
| 0:30:51| and we'll be sending those along with TABC as we-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1851)|
| 0:30:56| This is somewhat a new process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| But I'm sorry that you're the one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1858)|
| 0:31:00| who had to come and face the music tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1860)|
| 0:31:02| There are owners who have a legitimate investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1862)|
| 0:31:05| in this business, and I personally am quite disappointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1865)|
| 0:31:08| that none of them were here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| So there will be-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1870)|
| 0:31:11| The law department will be taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1871)|
| 0:31:12| the legal steps necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| and the owners will get that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| Is there anything else that I need to do on my behalf?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1877)|
| 0:31:19| No, you're good. I mean, there's nothing else for you to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1879)|
| 0:31:22| Okay, well, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1882)|
| 0:31:23| Okay, thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| All right, the next is Hannah's Cafe on Central Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| They have submitted a remedial plan of sorts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1888)|
| 0:31:31| and paid the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1891)|
| 0:31:41| My name is Mike Nacios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1901)|
| 0:31:42| I represent Hannah's Cafe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1902)|
| 0:31:44| With me is the owner, Rafiq Hannah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1904)|
| 0:31:51| Mr. Hannah has submitted a remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1911)|
| 0:31:54| I think the fine has been paid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1914)|
| 0:31:55| as the chairman, Madam Chairman, said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1915)|
| 0:32:00| The remedial plan, I think, sets out what we intend to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1920)|
| 0:32:04| What happened on this particular occasion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1924)|
| 0:32:06| was the person that was checking IDs at the door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1926)|
| 0:32:10| recognized the officer along with the cadet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1930)|
| 0:32:14| and thought they were there for official business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1934)|
| 0:32:17| and he did not check IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1937)|
| 0:32:22| He has been fired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1942)|
| 0:32:24| We have changed the manager of Hannah's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1944)|
| 0:32:28| We have retrained them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1948)|
| 0:32:31| We have now ordered a new system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1951)|
| 0:32:35| a new computer that can verify for false IDs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| that we should have in the next couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1958)|
| 0:32:43| I also would like to say that the cadets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1963)|
| 0:32:46| have visited a number of times in the last two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1966)|
| 0:32:49| and we have successfully not sold to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1969)|
| 0:32:53| and we have received letters to that effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1973)|
| 0:32:56| It was an unfortunate situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| and we respectfully ask for another chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1978)|
| 0:33:02| to be able to prove that we can comply with the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1982)|
| 0:33:05| All right, this was your second violation, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1985)|
| 0:33:07| within two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1987)|
| 0:33:09| I noted on your plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1989)|
| 0:33:11| that you terminated the person on the door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1991)|
| 0:33:14| and you've terminated the bartender,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| and you've replaced the manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| You have a new card reader| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| for those who come in the front door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2000)|
| 0:33:22| This is my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2002)|
| 0:33:23| How do you know that those replacement bartender,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2003)|
| 0:33:27| door person, and manager will not have a lapse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2007)|
| 0:33:32| do the same thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2012)|
| 0:33:33| In other words, your remedial plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| is not very comprehensive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2015)|
| 0:33:39| and for you to be here twice within two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2019)|
| 0:33:42| tells me that what you've been doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| is not working very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2024)|
| 0:33:45| So I personally am concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2025)|
| 0:33:48| that there's not a greater degree of effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2028)|
| 0:33:54| to be sure that this doesn't happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2034)|
| 0:33:56| Well, we have retrained everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2036)|
| 0:33:59| and certainly we have told them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2039)|
| 0:34:00| that there's no exceptions to anybody coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2040)|
| 0:34:03| without checking the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2043)|
| 0:34:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2045)|
| 0:34:06| And that was the lapse that occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2046)|
| 0:34:09| The person at the door said he recognized the police officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| and he thought he was there committing another sting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2052)|
| 0:34:16| and let him in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| So we did not accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| That was not, he's supposed to check everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2061)|
| 0:34:23| We fired him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2063)|
| 0:34:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2065)|
| 0:34:26| And we've retrained everybody, including the managers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| Now, the plan has worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| because there's been other occasions, as I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| that we did not sell to a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2072)|
| 0:34:37| All right, let me ask Sergeant Hunter to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| and then I'll get to you, Counseling Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2080)|
| 0:34:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2082)|
| 0:34:43| At least with the first incident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2083)|
| 0:34:44| I was there, I spoke with the doorman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2084)|
| 0:34:46| that you're speaking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| and the excuse he gave us that night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2088)|
| 0:34:52| was that he checked the ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| but the ID that we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| we always show him the ID a second time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| He said that that wasn't the ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2098)|
| 0:34:59| that he must have been shown a fake ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| otherwise he wouldn't have let him in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| And the bartender did not check inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| The second incident occurred March 16th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2106)|
| 0:35:11| when they were having the St. Patrick's Day pub crawl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2111)|
| 0:35:13| The officer and the cadet went up to the door at Hannah's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2113)|
| 0:35:16| where a female was selling pub crawl bands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2116)|
| 0:35:21| so that they can go from one business to another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2121)|
| 0:35:24| She did not check the ID of either the officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| or the cadet, proceeded to sell them the bands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| They walked inside and were served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2128)|
| 0:35:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2132)|
| 0:35:33| Yes, sir, Counseling Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2135)|
| 0:35:36| I'm a little concerned because we're talking six,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| we're talking six months that this has happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2138)|
| 0:35:41| First time was September 21st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2141)|
| 0:35:43| and then it was March 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2143)|
| 0:35:45| And I think that I'm concerned about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2145)|
| 0:35:49| and in fact, I'd be in favor of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| moving on to administrative hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2151)|
| 0:35:55| Are you making a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2155)|
| 0:35:57| I'll make a motion to that effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2161)|
| 0:36:02| This would then go to a suspension revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2162)|
| 0:36:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2165)|
| 0:36:06| Councilman DeLavoe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2166)|
| 0:36:07| Yeah, before we vote on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2167)|
| 0:36:08| I'd like to have this gentleman tell me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2168)|
| 0:36:10| what the retraining activity was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2170)|
| 0:36:12| that you said that you did with your staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2172)|
| 0:36:15| so that you replaced the folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| that were allowing the minors in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2177)|
| 0:36:20| and then you brought in new staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2180)|
| 0:36:21| and you had retraining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| What exactly was the training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2183)|
| 0:36:25| You want to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| No, we have a meeting every month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2187)|
| 0:36:31| showing videos about how can we identify just like minors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2191)|
| 0:36:37| and we're planning to send just like one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2197)|
| 0:36:38| I mean, twice, I mean, once a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| or one employee to the ABC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2200)|
| 0:36:43| I mean, to the police department for activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2203)|
| 0:36:47| And plus we-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2207)|
| 0:36:48| The task training with the police department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2208)|
| 0:36:49| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| I mean, very much, most of the people we have right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2211)|
| 0:36:54| because we have very much brand new stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2214)|
| 0:36:57| they had already the task, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2217)|
| 0:37:02| they've already been through that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2222)|
| 0:37:03| That's why, you know, just very much everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2223)|
| 0:37:07| except maybe one or two, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2227)|
| 0:37:08| they are new people after this incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| Okay, let me suggest that Heather Sutton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2230)|
| 0:37:14| would you raise your hand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2234)|
| 0:37:15| She's back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2235)|
| 0:37:16| She's with the Metropolitan Drug Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2236)|
| 0:37:17| and they have some very specific programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| that you might want to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| to help you with the ongoing training for your staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2241)|
| 0:37:24| To beef things up and to be sure that you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2244)|
| 0:37:27| on the right path so that we don't need to see you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| Now, we have a motion and a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| to send this to suspension revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2252)|
| 0:37:36| Mr. Stare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2256)|
| 0:37:37| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2257)|
| 0:37:38| I was just talking with our,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| I would like to hear from our attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2260)|
| 0:37:42| just about exactly what the standard is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2262)|
| 0:37:45| for whether we send it on to suspension revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2265)|
| 0:37:49| Well, this is the administrative hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2269)|
| 0:37:52| and the ordinances provide that the permit holder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| is supposed to appear and explain the circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2274)|
| 0:37:57| surrounding the violation, which we've heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2277)|
| 0:38:00| whether the written remedial plan has been followed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2280)|
| 0:38:04| and it will explain the permit holder's plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| to attempt to prevent any future violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2287)|
| 0:38:10| I think, you know, Mr. Nacios or Mr. Hanna| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2290)|
| 0:38:15| has given that explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2295)|
| 0:38:17| It's, you know, this board's determination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2297)|
| 0:38:20| whether or not to send it on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2300)|
| 0:38:22| the person who conducts the hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| is an attorney licensed in Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2305)|
| 0:38:28| who will weigh the evidences presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2308)|
| 0:38:31| by the city law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2311)|
| 0:38:32| The burden of proof is on the city law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2312)|
| 0:38:35| on whether or not to fine or suspend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2315)|
| 0:38:39| So we are, or you all as the beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2319)|
| 0:38:43| are determining whether or not you want a hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2323)|
| 0:38:47| to go forward and further information be brought in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2327)|
| 0:38:51| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2331)|
| 0:38:52| And I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2332)|
| 0:38:54| This, there's, I guess, two terminations and a replacement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2334)|
| 0:38:58| and that happened after the second sale, I guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2338)|
| 0:39:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2341)|
| 0:39:02| After the September sale, what action was taken?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2342)|
| 0:39:08| Well, we have a training, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2348)|
| 0:39:11| it's like, I think, you know, we did good after that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2351)|
| 0:39:14| but the only problem with that, like Mr. Nacios said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2354)|
| 0:39:19| you know, he's like the doormat, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| he thought, he saw the police officer, he recognized him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2361)|
| 0:39:24| and he thought, you know, it's just like it's busy day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2364)|
| 0:39:26| So we see many undercover police officer all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2366)|
| 0:39:29| and it was our fault or his fault, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2369)|
| 0:39:32| he did not check everybody, which we tell everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2372)|
| 0:39:35| even the friends or family, they have to be checked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2375)|
| 0:39:38| because we don't allow anybody under 21 period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2378)|
| 0:39:43| Okay, and then the, so with these terminations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2383)|
| 0:39:47| do you now have a zero tolerance policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2387)|
| 0:39:49| So anyone that either doesn't card or sells| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| to someone under age is terminated, is that a policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2391)|
| 0:39:55| or is that just depending on the circumstances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2395)|
| 0:39:56| No, it is a policy, you know, just like we cannot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2396)|
| 0:39:59| I mean, we've been in this location for 13 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2399)|
| 0:40:02| we never had a problem whatsoever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| and just like for one person come and work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| for a couple of months or a couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2406)|
| 0:40:08| and he just jeopardize the people who work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2408)|
| 0:40:12| and the business and the city, I don't think it's acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2412)|
| 0:40:16| Okay, well, I mean, I think, I mean, to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| I think that the terminations and the replacement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2419)|
| 0:40:22| shows me that they've taken this serious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2422)|
| 0:40:26| and I mean, I'll likely vote against the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2426)|
| 0:40:30| We'll have that vote in a moment, Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2430)|
| 0:40:34| Part of the problem I have with it is I look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2434)|
| 0:40:35| at a one-page plan in terms of what they're gonna do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2435)|
| 0:40:39| and basically they're terminating three people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| and putting in a card reader, they haven't really told us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2441)|
| 0:40:45| what the plan is really gonna be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2445)|
| 0:40:46| I mean, he's tried to explain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| Apparently they had a plan after September,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| and that plan didn't work, and so now we're looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2450)|
| 0:40:54| at another plan that happened, you know, within six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2454)|
| 0:40:57| and I just think that we take this very seriously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2457)|
| 0:41:00| and I think we need to let them know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2460)|
| 0:41:02| that we take it seriously and that we need more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2462)|
| 0:41:04| than just a one-page statement in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2464)|
| 0:41:07| of what they're gonna do, and I think that maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2467)|
| 0:41:08| this might really wake them up to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| hey, this is a serious situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2470)|
| 0:41:13| and we need to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2473)|
| 0:41:15| So that was one of the reasons that I made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2475)|
| 0:41:18| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2478)|
| 0:41:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2479)|
| 0:41:20| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2480)|
| 0:41:21| Well, mine's for Sergeant Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2481)|
| 0:41:21| Did you say they not only let him in the door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2481)|
| 0:41:24| but then they served him when they were inside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2484)|
| 0:41:28| is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| Yes, in the first case, in the September sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2490)|
| 0:41:33| the doorman ID'd them and then let them in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2493)|
| 0:41:36| and after he found out that the bartender inside served| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2496)|
| 0:41:39| an underage police cadet, we showed him the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2499)|
| 0:41:42| He said, this isn't the ID that they showed me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| It must have been a fake ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| The doorman is somebody, that particular night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| somebody that I've been familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2508)|
| 0:41:51| Prior to my assignment to the inspections unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| I was a supervisor for almost three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| in the East District, and we were posted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| in the Old City every Friday and Saturday night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2517)|
| 0:41:59| so we had quite a few dealings with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2519)|
| 0:42:02| Haven't had any previous issues, and like they had stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2522)|
| 0:42:06| they had passed several other compliance checks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2526)|
| 0:42:09| but in that particular night, he didn't check the ID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2529)|
| 0:42:12| correctly and they sold to the cadet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| It's a serious issue, and it's their responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2534)|
| 0:42:17| to get this stuff right, and the big difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2537)|
| 0:42:21| of whether Tin Roof came in here and presented their case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| and what they did, they did it voluntarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2543)|
| 0:42:26| and they have it, and it's just, we can't continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2546)|
| 0:42:31| to repeat behavior is unacceptable to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2551)|
| 0:42:36| so I think we're ready for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2556)|
| 0:42:39| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2559)|
| 0:42:40| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2560)|
| 0:42:42| You know, I certainly sympathize with the feelings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2562)|
| 0:42:45| that they do need to take it serious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| but I think the fact that they're here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2567)|
| 0:42:50| the long periods of time when they hadn't had problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2570)|
| 0:42:54| and then just the, it certainly isn't much on this page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2574)|
| 0:42:58| but the actions taken were very serious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2578)|
| 0:43:00| and to me, it seems that they are taking it serious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2580)|
| 0:43:02| and we have a system set up, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2582)|
| 0:43:05| it's basically a three-strike system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| and this is the second strike, so to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2587)|
| 0:43:11| you know, I think that they have taken it serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2591)|
| 0:43:14| It's an unfortunate, but sometimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2594)|
| 0:43:16| lightning strikes twice in a short amount of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2596)|
| 0:43:19| so that's just my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| Okay, Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2601)|
| 0:43:24| Councilman, well, Madam Chair or Mr. Frost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2604)|
| 0:43:27| at any time during the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| first offense or third offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| we can move to a presentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2611)|
| 0:43:34| Well, generally speaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2614)|
| 0:43:34| we don't hear about the first offenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| They're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2616)|
| 0:43:37| Well, I'm just saying at any point during this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2617)|
| 0:43:39| it doesn't have to be a third strike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| No, it is optional at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2621)|
| 0:43:44| for the second offense within a rolling two-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2624)|
| 0:43:47| I believe the third offense is an automatic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2627)|
| 0:43:50| Automatic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2630)|
| 0:43:52| If I may say something, Madam Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2632)|
| 0:43:56| We did fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2636)|
| 0:43:57| It was the same person at the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2637)|
| 0:43:58| We did fire him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| We've gone for 13 years without any major problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2640)|
| 0:44:04| and obviously, we take it seriously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2644)|
| 0:44:07| and obviously, after tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2647)|
| 0:44:10| we would take it a lot more seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2650)|
| 0:44:14| With all due respect, we would request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| that if you want more documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| if you can put us on the docket for the next meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| we will come up with a more comprehensive plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2662)|
| 0:44:26| rather than go to the hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2666)|
| 0:44:29| and present the information there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2669)|
| 0:44:32| I would respectfully ask that this matter be put off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2672)|

| 0:44:41| Any comment from the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| All right, then, I think we need to vote on the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2684)|
| 0:44:46| to send to a hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2686)|
| 0:44:48| All those in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2688)|
| 0:44:50| Aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2690)|
| 0:44:51| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2691)|
| 0:44:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2692)|
| 0:44:53| All right, do we need a roll call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2695)|

| 0:45:01| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2701)|
| 0:45:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2702)|
| 0:45:03| Chairman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2703)|
| 0:45:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2704)|
| 0:45:05| Vice Mayor Pablos?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2705)|
| 0:45:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2706)|
| 0:45:07| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2707)|
| 0:45:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2708)|
| 0:45:09| Councilman Steyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2709)|
| 0:45:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2710)|
| 0:45:11| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2711)|
| 0:45:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2712)|
| 0:45:15| It's approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2715)|
| 0:45:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2716)|
| 0:45:17| Five-four, and the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| will be in touch with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2719)|
| 0:45:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2720)|
| 0:45:21| All right, the next case on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2721)|
| 0:45:24| is the Exotic Night Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| And while they're coming up to the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2726)|
| 0:45:29| they have paid their fines, submitted a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2729)|
| 0:45:32| In fact, it's quite a detailed plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| And they've increased significant vigilance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2734)|
| 0:45:38| to avoid underage service, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2738)|
| 0:45:43| When we finish with this part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2743)|
| 0:45:44| I have a comment to make about being a good neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2744)|
| 0:45:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2747)|
| 0:45:48| And this is in regard to a complaint I've received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| even though your club's not in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2750)|
| 0:45:52| All right, could you please tell us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2752)|
| 0:45:54| the occasion of this citation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2754)|
| 0:45:57| what you're going to do to be sure it never happens again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2757)|
| 0:46:00| Well, first of all, my name is Greg Harrison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2760)|
| 0:46:02| I'm a member of the Knoxville Bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2762)|
| 0:46:04| I'm an attorney for the Exotic Night Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| My address is 800 South Gay Street, Suite 1650, 37929.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2766)|
| 0:46:14| As a side note, before I begin the remedial plan issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2774)|
| 0:46:19| we have been in negotiations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| with the Alcoholic Beverage Commission in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2781)|
| 0:46:25| I have personally spoken with the assistant director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| on a couple of different occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| There will be a suspension levied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2790)|
| 0:46:33| against the Exotic Night Club by the ABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2793)|
| 0:46:37| The issue that, and I say it's ongoing negotiations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2797)|
| 0:46:41| because the issue pending between, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2801)|
| 0:46:44| myself as a representative of the Exotic Night Club| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2804)|
| 0:46:47| and the ABC is not necessarily the length of the suspension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2807)|
| 0:46:51| but whether or not the suspension will be divided up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2811)|
| 0:46:54| into two separate parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| So that's the issue that we are currently dealing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2816)|
| 0:47:00| with Nashville, but I will tell you that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2820)|
| 0:47:03| without question, there will be a suspension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2823)|
| 0:47:06| and we'll accept that because of our transgressions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2826)|
| 0:47:10| We don't like it, but we will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2830)|
| 0:47:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2834)|
| 0:47:14| So I don't know if that affects what we talk about here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2834)|
| 0:47:18| but if you want me to go into the specific incident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2838)|
| 0:47:21| as I understand it to be, I'll be glad to do that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2843)|
| 0:47:24| Do you all want to hear the specific incident?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2844)|
| 0:47:26| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2846)|
| 0:47:28| Are the owners here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2848)|
| 0:47:29| Are you the only one representing them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2849)|
| 0:47:31| I'm the only attorney there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2851)|
| 0:47:32| To my knowledge, they represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2852)|
| 0:47:33| Are the people here from the club?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2855)|
| 0:47:36| I just find that pretty offensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2856)|
| 0:47:38| Well, you know, I do too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2858)|
| 0:47:40| and I'll tell you what my discussions were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| with Mr. Ponce, who is, my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2862)|
| 0:47:45| is the owner of the club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2865)|
| 0:47:47| I've spoken with him about my negotiations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2867)|
| 0:47:50| or ongoing negotiations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2870)|
| 0:47:51| with the Alcoholic Beverage Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2871)|
| 0:47:53| I'm the one that told him to get that fine in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2873)|
| 0:47:56| and I read the letter to be three business days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2876)|
| 0:48:00| prior to today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2880)|
| 0:48:01| So he pays us a portion of that $500 fine in cash,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2881)|
| 0:48:07| and then another portion on a credit card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2887)|
| 0:48:10| And the way our firm is set up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2890)|
| 0:48:13| it takes two days to turn that credit card around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2893)|
| 0:48:16| so I can write a check to the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2896)|
| 0:48:19| So I have to send my, I'm humping it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2899)|
| 0:48:22| to get that check to Cindy Mitchell's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2902)|
| 0:48:26| to beat that three-day time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2906)|
| 0:48:29| So I send my secretary, it turns out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2909)|
| 0:48:31| I end up having to send my secretary down here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2911)|
| 0:48:33| on a spring break,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2913)|
| 0:48:34| I end up having to send my secretary down here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2914)|
| 0:48:36| on a sprint to beat the 72-hour deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2916)|
| 0:48:39| So yeah, and I told him that you need to be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2919)|
| 0:48:42| at six o'clock for this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2922)|
| 0:48:44| He assured me he'd be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2924)|
| 0:48:46| I tried to call him twice while I got here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2926)|
| 0:48:49| before the meeting started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2929)|
| 0:48:50| and then after the meeting started, I tried to call him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| And I, Councilman Grieve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2932)|
| 0:48:57| I don't know if a lawyer's supposed to agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2937)|
| 0:48:58| against his client, but that kind of aggravates me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2938)|
| 0:49:01| We go to court every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| and if our client doesn't show up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2943)|
| 0:49:05| we're not gonna have much success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2945)|
| 0:49:07| So I'm here because I said I'd be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2947)|
| 0:49:11| Can I tell you how many phone calls I've gotten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2951)|
| 0:49:13| in the last three months from this group?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2953)|
| 0:49:15| From my client?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2955)|
| 0:49:17| No, I can't find your client, that's why I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2957)|
| 0:49:19| From the general public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2959)|
| 0:49:20| From the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2960)|
| 0:49:21| And I've got one owner down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| who has a business whose young people are leaving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2964)|
| 0:49:27| because of what's going on at this establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2967)|
| 0:49:30| And so, like I said, I'm really offended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2970)|
| 0:49:32| that the guy doesn't even show up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2972)|
| 0:49:34| So I have no sympathy whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2974)|
| 0:49:38| And so whatever, as far as I'm concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2978)|
| 0:49:41| he needs to go before the hearing board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2981)|
| 0:49:43| especially if he can't even show up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2983)|
| 0:49:45| and show us any kind of respect in what he's looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2985)|
| 0:49:49| But I'm sure that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| I don't know if this is the place to bring it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2991)|
| 0:49:52| but I'll bring it up anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2992)|
| 0:49:54| He's not a very good neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2994)|
| 0:49:56| And the number of complaints that we've gotten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2996)|
| 0:49:59| from those businesses down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| the mess that's left in the parking lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3001)|
| 0:50:04| that we hear about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| and I won't even go into detail of what that mess is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3006)|
| 0:50:09| but it's gotten pretty bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3009)|
| 0:50:11| And what's happening is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3011)|
| 0:50:13| is they're running off other businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3013)|
| 0:50:15| good businesses that are down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| And so I'm sure Chairman Palmer might have something to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3017)|
| 0:50:20| because I think you've gotten phone calls also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| But I just, I understand where you're coming from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3022)|
| 0:50:26| and I appreciate you as the lawyer saying what you did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3026)|
| 0:50:29| because it is, it's very-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3029)|
| 0:50:31| I mean, it's somewhat embarrassing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3031)|
| 0:50:34| to be standing up here naked, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3034)|
| 0:50:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3036)|
| 0:50:38| We can-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3038)|
| 0:50:39| Especially being 51 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3039)|
| 0:50:40| We can fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3040)|
| 0:50:43| Anyway, that's what I know about the situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3043)|
| 0:50:46| in terms of suspension, what I've done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3046)|
| 0:50:49| and what they plan to do in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3049)|
| 0:50:53| All right, well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3053)|
| 0:50:54| And I will just pile on to, if Councilman Grieve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3054)|
| 0:50:55| then we'll go to Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3055)|
| 0:50:57| There's a church less than a block from that club| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3057)|
| 0:51:01| and the people who, the overflow parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3061)|
| 0:51:04| parks in the church yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| They pretty much destroyed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3066)|
| 0:51:07| They pretty much ruined the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3067)|
| 0:51:10| So I've gotten complaints from the church about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3070)|
| 0:51:12| And so, but you're not the one who's going to solve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3072)|
| 0:51:15| That's going to be Mr. Potts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3075)|
| 0:51:17| Mr. Frost, do you want to clear the air?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3077)|
| 0:51:19| And we need to move along folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3079)|
| 0:51:21| because we have one more case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3081)|
| 0:51:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3083)|
| 0:51:24| I'll be brief, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3084)|
| 0:51:25| I certainly understand Mr. Harrison's position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3085)|
| 0:51:28| Don't begrudge him at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3088)|
| 0:51:31| And I've heard how folks on the beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3091)|
| 0:51:33| feel about this particular person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3093)|
| 0:51:35| even though it's certainly, you know, you're not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3095)|
| 0:51:38| it sounds like a number of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3098)|
| 0:51:39| aren't amused at the present situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3099)|
| 0:51:43| Before you all vote whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3103)|
| 0:51:44| to send this on to the hearing officer, what we're really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3104)|
| 0:51:48| taking into account, or briefly what I discussed earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3108)|
| 0:51:52| you know, an explanation of the problem that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3112)|
| 0:51:54| got these people here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3114)|
| 0:51:55| Their remedial plan and how they intend to fix it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3115)|
| 0:51:57| going forward in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3117)|
| 0:52:00| Those are really the things that should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3120)|
| 0:52:03| govern your all's decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3123)|
| 0:52:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3125)|
| 0:52:06| I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3126)|
| 0:52:07| All right, do I hear a motion to send this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3127)|
| 0:52:09| to the hearing officer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3129)|
| 0:52:10| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3130)|
| 0:52:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3131)|
| 0:52:12| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3132)|
| 0:52:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3133)|
| 0:52:14| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3134)|
| 0:52:15| Okay, the law department will be in touch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3135)|
| 0:52:18| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3138)|
| 0:52:19| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3139)|
| 0:52:20| Okay, the last case before us is the Bearden Beer Garden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3140)|
| 0:52:23| They have paid the fines, submitted a remedial plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3143)|
| 0:52:27| and are here to explain why this will never happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3147)|
| 0:52:34| I was contacted the-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3154)|
| 0:52:36| Okay, your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3156)|
| 0:52:37| Yes, Christopher Morton, 45240 Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3157)|
| 0:52:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3160)|
| 0:52:41| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3161)|
| 0:52:42| I was notified on May 24th that we had two citations written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3162)|
| 0:52:48| The next morning, I saw the employees pretty devastated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3168)|
| 0:52:52| and he explained to me that he checked the ID twice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3172)|
| 0:52:56| made a remark that he couldn't believe 1992 was legal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3176)|
| 0:53:00| and proceeded to serve the cadet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3180)|
| 0:53:04| I assured him that mistakes are made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3184)|
| 0:53:08| that he would remain part of our staff family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3188)|
| 0:53:11| and then told him that we all had responsibilities there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3191)|
| 0:53:14| That was his first day back from graduate school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3194)|
| 0:53:18| and I should have pulled him aside and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3198)|
| 0:53:20| hey, get your game face on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3200)|
| 0:53:21| and then I told the guys that if they have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3201)|
| 0:53:25| if there's any suspicion, he checks it twice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3205)|
| 0:53:27| and makes a comment like that, they should back him up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3207)|
| 0:53:31| We also have appointed another, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3211)|
| 0:53:34| we promoted another manager that has the certification now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3214)|
| 0:53:39| and we are gonna adhere to our strict policy inside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3219)|
| 0:53:45| that we keep doubling up our efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3225)|
| 0:53:47| We have, we're gonna put five minutes or so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3227)|
| 0:53:52| into every single monthly staff meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3232)|
| 0:53:54| to address and just keep reiterating policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3234)|
| 0:53:59| We are still continuing to participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3239)|
| 0:54:03| in the Responsible Retailing Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3243)|
| 0:54:05| where we have people come in that test us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3245)|
| 0:54:08| and then send us results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3248)|
| 0:54:12| We've added another employee to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3252)|
| 0:54:15| during critical business hour, crowded business hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3255)|
| 0:54:19| to give us another layer of protection at the door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3259)|
| 0:54:23| and we are quite frightened and ashamed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3263)|
| 0:54:26| that we've been cited twice within two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3266)|
| 0:54:29| and everybody's pretty upset,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3269)|
| 0:54:31| and rightfully so, pretty motivated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3271)|
| 0:54:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3274)|
| 0:54:37| Anybody have any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3277)|
| 0:54:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3279)|
| 0:54:41| I appreciate, I mean, I hate you're here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3281)|
| 0:54:45| just aggravates me to no end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3285)|
| 0:54:46| and I've said it a hundred times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3286)|
| 0:54:48| y'all are tired of hearing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3288)|
| 0:54:49| but, you know, when they just fire the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3289)|
| 0:54:52| as though that's gonna appease this group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3292)|
| 0:54:55| does not appease this group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3295)|
| 0:54:57| I think you did the right thing by keeping them there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3297)|
| 0:55:00| and if it was a long-time employee particularly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3300)|
| 0:55:02| and teach them, make them learn from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3302)|
| 0:55:05| I mean, you're in a hard business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| and there's turnover, and if you fire that person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| they can go probably less than a mile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3310)|
| 0:55:13| and get five other jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3313)|
| 0:55:15| tending bar or working in a restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3315)|
| 0:55:18| So, I hate you're here again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3318)|
| 0:55:21| but I applaud you for teaching them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3321)|
| 0:55:24| because once they leave you as graduate student,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3324)|
| 0:55:27| he or she may open a bar themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3327)|
| 0:55:30| and they will learn from that experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3330)|
| 0:55:32| so that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3332)|
| 0:55:34| The first citation that we got with Kate Kaufman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3334)|
| 0:55:38| that's, we promoted her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| because she's proven to us that she is dedicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3340)|
| 0:55:44| to taking care of our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3344)|
| 0:55:45| All right, Councilman Gray, one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3345)|
| 0:55:47| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3347)|
| 0:55:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3349)|
| 0:55:51| I just want to say that, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| what we have here is an individual and a group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3353)|
| 0:55:56| that's really trying to pick up the pieces where they were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3356)|
| 0:55:59| and I also know that it's a pretty busy place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3359)|
| 0:56:02| pretty busy establishment, it's in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3362)|
| 0:56:05| and I think they've made a real conscientious effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3365)|
| 0:56:08| to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3368)|
| 0:56:09| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3369)|
| 0:56:12| Any motions, any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3372)|
| 0:56:13| All right, Heather Sutton, would you raise your hand again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3373)|
| 0:56:16| She's back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3376)|
| 0:56:17| She's with Metropolitan Drug Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3377)|
| 0:56:19| You might want to talk with Heather,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3379)|
| 0:56:20| because they do have some things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3380)|
| 0:56:21| that would help in your ongoing training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3381)|
| 0:56:24| Being no other business before this fear board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3384)|
| 0:56:26| we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130625?start=3386)|
