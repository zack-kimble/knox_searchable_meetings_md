| 0:00:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2)|
| 0:00:31| Good afternoon, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=31)|
| 0:00:32| We're going to go ahead and get started with a moment of silence and the Pledge of Allegiance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=32)|
| 0:00:36| led by Ms. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=36)|
| 0:00:52| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=52)|
| 0:00:57| and to the republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=57)|
| 0:01:00| one nation, under God, indivisible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=60)|
| 0:01:04| with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=64)|
| 0:01:11| Welcome, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=71)|
| 0:01:12| I don't think I see any elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=72)|
| 0:01:18| But welcome to board members and staff and others in attendance and those who are watching online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=78)|
| 0:01:24| Once again, we appreciate your patience and cooperation as we follow social distancing guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=84)|
| 0:01:31| so that our June meetings may be held in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=91)|
| 0:01:33| So it's nice to see those of you who are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=93)|
| 0:01:35| Also, we would like to welcome our 2020-2021 student representative, Ms. Abigail Lee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=95)|
| 0:01:42| who's seated beside Noah Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=102)|
| 0:01:44| We are so glad that you could join us tonight to become acclimated to these processes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=104)|
| 0:01:50| and we look forward to sharing more information about Abigail at our July meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=110)|
| 0:01:57| As Ms. Fabb shared last week, I have scheduled a called meeting on Friday, June 19th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=117)|
| 0:02:02| for consideration of the superintendent's annual evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=122)|
| 0:02:05| The meeting will be held in this boardroom at 10.30 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=125)|
| 0:02:09| and an agenda with supporting documentation will be published in the next few days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=129)|
| 0:02:14| And at this point, I'm going to call on Mr. Thomas to give us an update on the reopening task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=134)|
| 0:02:23| and just kind of a briefing on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=143)|
| 0:02:26| Yes, thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=146)|
| 0:02:28| I appreciate an opportunity just to talk for just a few minutes and more or less off the cuff about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=148)|
| 0:02:34| But, you know, we value everyone's opinion in terms of this reopening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=154)|
| 0:02:40| I guess our main goal, you know, we want to be, first of all, we want to be in school on August 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=160)|
| 0:02:44| We want our students in school and we want to do that in a safe manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=164)|
| 0:02:49| so we consider the safety of our students, the safety of our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=169)|
| 0:02:53| And in order to gather the input from all of our stakeholders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=173)|
| 0:02:58| and I'll define stakeholders here in just a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=178)|
| 0:03:00| first of all, we asked the Board of Education to, we wanted to establish a task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=180)|
| 0:03:07| and we asked each board member to submit a name of someone in their community that could serve on this task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=187)|
| 0:03:13| And each board member did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=193)|
| 0:03:15| And for that, I am very appreciative that you submitted a name to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=195)|
| 0:03:19| And the task force is one layer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=199)|
| 0:03:21| There's multiple layers to this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=201)|
| 0:03:23| So the task force, there will be public meetings because they will be presenting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=203)|
| 0:03:29| not recommendations, presenting the results of the survey information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=209)|
| 0:03:34| We wanted to have a group to help us plan in a way to look at that objectively and to be transparent about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=214)|
| 0:03:41| So the best way to do that, we thought, was, again, to have a community involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=221)|
| 0:03:46| And that's what the task force is all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=226)|
| 0:03:49| That's not to say that the input from everybody else is any less important because it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=229)|
| 0:03:54| As a matter of fact, we've got four focus groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=234)|
| 0:03:57| Focus groups are made up of teachers, students, parents, and administrators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=237)|
| 0:04:02| Those focus groups will be doing, if you will, a deeper dive into the survey questions and the responses that we've gotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=242)|
| 0:04:10| And what I mean by deeper dive, okay, we know how you answered this question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=250)|
| 0:04:13| but what was behind your answer for this question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=253)|
| 0:04:16| So that we can gather all the information to basically make the best decision, again, for our students and our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=256)|
| 0:04:23| So the focus groups, where did the teachers come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=263)|
| 0:04:27| Those teachers are representatives of our teacher advisory council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=267)|
| 0:04:31| What is the teacher advisory council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=271)|
| 0:04:33| That is a group that this board established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=273)|
| 0:04:36| It's made up of teachers, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=276)|
| 0:04:38| The teachers pick the teachers that are on that council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=278)|
| 0:04:41| So that's not something I pick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=281)|
| 0:04:43| Again, the teachers do that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=283)|
| 0:04:45| And we meet all throughout the year, several meetings, well, once a month for maybe seven, eight months during the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=285)|
| 0:04:52| So we have teachers from that group that will be part of the focus group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=292)|
| 0:04:56| Also, our KAC, I mean KCEA, our Knox County Educators Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=296)|
| 0:05:02| they're members from the Knox County Educators Association on that group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=302)|
| 0:05:08| So they represent the membership of our teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=308)|
| 0:05:11| And again, the students, we have a student advisory council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=311)|
| 0:05:14| The students were chosen based on their participation in student advisory council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=314)|
| 0:05:18| We have a family advisory council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=318)|
| 0:05:20| We've helped with the selection with family members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=320)|
| 0:05:23| So I just want to say that the job that those focus groups will do for us is invaluable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=323)|
| 0:05:29| because how else are we going to make the decisions if we don't hear from you what your thinking is and why you're thinking that way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=329)|
| 0:05:36| So I know there's been some miscommunication about maybe not having an educator on the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=336)|
| 0:05:42| Again, we asked board members for a representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=342)|
| 0:05:45| We could have gotten an educator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=345)|
| 0:05:48| But again, we were looking for community members because the educator voice is the teacher focus group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=348)|
| 0:05:53| We already were going to have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=353)|
| 0:05:55| So again, just looking at that community support, as far as a health educator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=355)|
| 0:06:01| we're in daily communications with the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=361)|
| 0:06:05| So we do rely on the information that's provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=365)|
| 0:06:08| And again, they're another layer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=368)|
| 0:06:09| So focus group's a layer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=369)|
| 0:06:11| Task force is a layer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=371)|
| 0:06:13| Health department's a layer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=373)|
| 0:06:14| The State Department of Education and what the governor says is a layer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=374)|
| 0:06:19| So there are multiple layers to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=379)|
| 0:06:21| And again, the decision ultimately or recommendation ultimately resides with the superintendent making a recommendation to the board as to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=381)|
| 0:06:29| hey, here's what we're going to do based on all this feedback that we've gathered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=389)|
| 0:06:34| So I think we've worked and we've tried to work really hard involving as many people across this community as we possibly can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=394)|
| 0:06:42| We've had 22,000 responses to the survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=402)|
| 0:06:46| I think 71,000 and something invitations to families and stakeholders were sent out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=406)|
| 0:06:52| It's on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=412)|
| 0:06:53| It's open until June the 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=413)|
| 0:06:55| So if you're not within that 22,000, what I would encourage you to do tonight, tomorrow, the next day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=415)|
| 0:07:01| or any time before June 19th is to fill out one of those surveys for us so we can get your input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=421)|
| 0:07:08| And I think our research department thought maybe we'd get 6,000 or 7,000 responses, but 22,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=428)|
| 0:07:14| So pretty remarkable in terms of the number of people that responded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=434)|
| 0:07:18| And all this information will be used by us to help make the best recommendation that we can to our board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=438)|
| 0:07:26| and again with the safety of our students and our staff being the main focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=446)|
| 0:07:30| And then the next focus is, you know, get our students in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=450)|
| 0:07:36| And so we're trying our best to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=456)|
| 0:07:39| So I just wanted to take a minute and let everybody know that, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=459)|
| 0:07:43| no group is more important than the other group if you're serving on a focus group, task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=463)|
| 0:07:47| whatever capacity you're serving in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=467)|
| 0:07:49| Maybe you're not serving on any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=469)|
| 0:07:50| We'll get the survey in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=470)|
| 0:07:51| So, again, hope that helps to clear up some of the miscommunication, if that's what it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=471)|
| 0:07:59| or misunderstanding because that was certainly not the intent on our part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=479)|
| 0:08:04| We're trying to do the best we can to gather everyone's input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=484)|
| 0:08:09| So I don't know if there are questions about that, Madam Chair or board members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=489)|
| 0:08:12| but I'll be glad to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=492)|
| 0:08:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=495)|
| 0:08:16| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=496)|
| 0:08:17| Ms. Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=497)|
| 0:08:18| I just would like to add that you were very clear, Bob, in your press release| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=498)|
| 0:08:22| and in your notification you sent to staff and faculty that there were several groups involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=502)|
| 0:08:30| Right up front you did say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=510)|
| 0:08:32| Yeah, great point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=512)|
| 0:08:33| There was a press release that went out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=513)|
| 0:08:35| You know, sometimes people see what they want to see and maybe hear what they want to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=515)|
| 0:08:39| And I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=519)|
| 0:08:40| I'm the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=520)|
| 0:08:41| But we did identify all the groups, I think, in the press release.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=521)|
| 0:08:47| I know I had a couple of few interviews last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=527)|
| 0:08:49| I think I even talked about it in the interview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=529)|
| 0:08:52| I know last week's superintendent report once again talked about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=532)|
| 0:08:57| and who all was going to be involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=537)|
| 0:09:00| So I appreciate you letting me say a word or two about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=540)|
| 0:09:05| Thank you, Ms. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=545)|
| 0:09:06| Ms. Christie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=546)|
| 0:09:07| Yeah, I would just like to say thank you to the people that volunteered to be on the task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=547)|
| 0:09:12| because I think they have come under some unfair criticism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=552)|
| 0:09:16| which is unfortunate because we reached out to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=556)|
| 0:09:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=560)|
| 0:09:21| Yes, I agree, Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=561)|
| 0:09:23| I didn't realize I was doing that to my friends and associates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=563)|

| 0:12:26| a very deserving student, not disturbing, deserving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=746)|
| 0:12:33| I'll try to get through this, Noah, without any mess ups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=753)|
| 0:12:42| Noah Kelly was selected through a very rigorous application and interview process during the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=762)|
| 0:12:49| spring of 2019 as our Board of Education Student Representative for the 2019-2020 school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=769)|
| 0:12:56| Noah graduated just a couple of days ago as valedictorian of Carnes High School with a wonderful speech,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=776)|
| 0:13:03| I might add, that I've heard, I heard about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=783)|
| 0:13:06| He had a 4.58 GPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=786)|
| 0:13:09| To highlight just a few of his other accomplishments during Noah's time at Carnes, he was a member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=789)|
| 0:13:16| of the National Honor Society, student government, and the Technology Student Association, where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=796)|
| 0:13:22| he served as state president during his junior year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=802)|
| 0:13:26| He also served on our district student advisory council and through that role was able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=806)|
| 0:13:31| travel to Nashville and participate in the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Pathways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=811)|
| 0:13:36| Conference, where he had the opportunity to talk about educational disparities and post-secondary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=816)|
| 0:13:42| opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=822)|
| 0:13:43| Of course, he is not all about academics, and anyone who is familiar with Noah knows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=823)|
| 0:13:49| how musical he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=829)|
| 0:13:51| And it's no surprise that he was also the drum major of the Carnes High School marching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=831)|
| 0:13:56| band during his senior year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=836)|
| 0:13:58| Noah's future plans include going to Vanderbilt University and becoming a pediatrician, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=838)|
| 0:14:04| is so very impressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=844)|
| 0:14:06| But I believe even more impressive and most notable, and his most notable accomplishment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=846)|
| 0:14:12| is his service as an unwavering leader, not only to students, but to the entire district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=852)|
| 0:14:18| during this unprecedented time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=858)|
| 0:14:20| No other student class during my lifetime has dealt with a global state of emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=860)|
| 0:14:25| and a pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=865)|
| 0:14:27| So on behalf of the board and Knox County Schools, I want to thank Noah for his service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=867)|
| 0:14:32| to our entire community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=872)|

| 0:14:39| Every year, we say how hard it is to say goodbye to a student representative, and I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=879)|
| 0:14:47| everybody sitting around this table would agree that it's certainly difficult this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=887)|
| 0:14:51| and Noah, you will hold a special place in our hearts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=891)|
| 0:14:54| And we congratulate you and we wish you all the best in your future endeavors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=894)|

| 0:21:46| This is just an adoption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1306)|
| 0:21:47| This is not a purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1307)|
| 0:21:50| So this is not in the current budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1310)|
| 0:21:53| So we're going to be teaching these classes without textbooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1313)|

| 0:22:46| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1366)|
| 0:22:47| Can you restate the question I didn't hear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1367)|
| 0:22:50| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1370)|
| 0:22:51| Could you just explain to us about what's been going on about looking at it and looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1371)|
| 0:22:55| at traffic issues and things like that in regard to this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1375)|
| 0:22:59| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1379)|
| 0:23:00| We brought this piece of property to the board last month, and there was some concern about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1380)|
| 0:23:06| the county about the added traffic to Coward Mill Road, and they wanted to do a traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1386)|
| 0:23:14| study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1394)|
| 0:23:15| And they've completed that study, and Mr. Snowden from county engineering is here if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1395)|
| 0:23:22| you have any specific questions for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1402)|
| 0:23:24| But basically what he reported back to us is the study said the traffic on Coward Mill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1404)|
| 0:23:30| would be significantly increased and that they had some safety concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1410)|
| 0:23:36| And we met with Mr. Snowden and representatives from the mayor's office yesterday afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1416)|
| 0:23:43| the superintendent, and our finance office, and discussed what those were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1423)|
| 0:23:48| And we will propose or are proposing that we share the cost of the needed improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1428)|
| 0:24:01| with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1441)|
| 0:24:04| The improvements are estimated to be in the neighborhood of $4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1444)|
| 0:24:08| So the county would pick up two of that, and we would add $2 million to this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1448)|
| 0:24:13| So instead of a $22 million project over three years, it would ultimately be a $24 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1453)|
| 0:24:19| project over three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1459)|
| 0:24:22| And I understand that right now the improvements that are being discussed by the county engineer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1462)|
| 0:24:30| and of course Mr. Snowden can talk to this much better than I can, but there's a widening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1470)|
| 0:24:35| of the road surface and potentially adding sidewalks to one side of the road and a replacement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1475)|
| 0:24:44| or an addition, additional bridge on the road that would allow bypass for the existing one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1484)|
| 0:24:51| lane bridge that's at the far east end of Coward Mill Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1491)|
| 0:24:57| And does, I've been out there in the business park that's there, is that road going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1497)|
| 0:25:03| connected to Coward Mill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1503)|
| 0:25:05| Chair Ahala, I understand the extension from where it currently terminates to Coward Mill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1505)|
| 0:25:11| has been approved and funded and is expected to start construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1511)|
| 0:25:17| Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1517)|

| 0:25:29| Yeah, that project, as Russ was saying, is funded and it is slated to start construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1529)|
| 0:25:34| later this fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1534)|
| 0:25:35| So it should be complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1535)|
| 0:25:37| Chair Ahala's extension to Coward Mill much before the school is completed in 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1537)|
| 0:25:46| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1547)|
| 0:25:49| No, I mean, you know, I had gone out there and I had received several people contacting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1549)|

| 0:25:58| So I appreciate looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| I mean, I think this just brings up a lot of concerns I keep having just about, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1560)|
| 0:26:06| not even schools, but about our county planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1566)|
| 0:26:08| And we keep putting neighborhoods more and more in places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1568)|
| 0:26:12| And then what happens is the schools are not thought about on the forefront and it's after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1572)|
| 0:26:18| the fact we have got to put schools in to support the growth in these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1578)|
| 0:26:22| And then there's impacts on the roads and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| And, you know, it just, it concerns me just the whole planning of our county on some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1585)|
| 0:26:31| this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1591)|
| 0:26:32| I mean, the way it happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1592)|
| 0:26:33| And, you know, once again, this is not just individually with this project, but I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1593)|
| 0:26:36| this project, you know, brings up some of just the overall growth issues that our county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1596)|
| 0:26:40| faces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1600)|
| 0:26:41| So I just kind of wanted to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1605)|
| 0:26:48| Besides the traffic issue, we also had some communication from residents who were concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1608)|
| 0:26:53| about the appropriateness of the area for a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1613)|
| 0:26:58| They're concerned about potential sinkholes in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1618)|
| 0:27:01| Have we looked at that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1621)|
| 0:27:03| We have done our due diligence on geotechnical engineering and they have looked closely at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1623)|
| 0:27:09| that site and they haven't found any reason that would, you know, cause that site to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1629)|
| 0:27:15| problematic as far as our construction project would be concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1635)|
| 0:27:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1638)|
| 0:27:20| And I would support, since it is so close to residential areas, I think it'd be great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1640)|
| 0:27:25| if we're able to add the sidewalks as part of the road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1645)|
| 0:27:29| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1651)|
| 0:27:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1654)|
| 0:27:35| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1655)|
| 0:27:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1656)|
| 0:27:37| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1657)|
| 0:27:38| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1658)|
| 0:27:41| Item 10C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1661)|
| 0:27:42| Approve utilization of general purpose fund balance in the event that sales tax revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1662)|
| 0:27:46| is insufficient to meet existing expenditure obligations through June 30, 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1666)|
| 0:27:52| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1672)|
| 0:27:53| We have a motion by Mr. Norman, a second by Ms. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1673)|
| 0:27:56| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1678)|
| 0:27:59| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1679)|
| 0:28:00| Is this, I guess Mr. McPherson would be the proper person to answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1680)|
| 0:28:07| Is there a cap on this or is it just a blank check basically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1687)|
| 0:28:13| Well, let me characterize it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1693)|
| 0:28:20| We don't feel this would put us in a perilous position necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1700)|
| 0:28:25| It's just that this would allow us to go into that 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1705)|
| 0:28:29| Now that 3% is about $15 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1709)|
| 0:28:32| So what we're actually asking is, so we're not running back and forth to the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1712)|
| 0:28:36| so we can do this on a timely basis, is if we should go below that $15 million mark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1716)|
| 0:28:41| do we have permission from the board to actually use dollars from the rainy day fund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1721)|
| 0:28:47| You know, a bit of good news, but I'm going to say this very cautiously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1727)|
| 0:28:53| Preliminary indications from the state is that April was significantly better than what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1733)|
| 0:29:00| everyone had anticipated, or most everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1740)|
| 0:29:05| We have budgeted to replenish fund balance to what we could possibly around $4 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1745)|
| 0:29:12| if we go into the 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1752)|
| 0:29:16| So if this trend continues, again, this is very preliminary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| We don't even know what it means to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1759)|
| 0:29:21| We're looking at it on a statewide level, so we're having to kind of do some back-of-the-envelope calculations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1761)|
| 0:29:27| But it looks like that sales tax came in at about 87% in April of the prior year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1767)|
| 0:29:35| We were receiving information from a host of sources that it could be around 50% to 60%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1775)|
| 0:29:42| So March was also a little better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1782)|
| 0:29:45| So we're very hopeful, but I want to be cautious in delivering the message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1785)|
| 0:29:50| We're very hopeful that the degree that we might have to go into fund balance will not be as significant as what we're projecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1790)|
| 0:30:00| We're keeping our fingers crossed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1800)|
| 0:30:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1802)|
| 0:30:03| Would it be, based on what you know and highly suspect should happen, based on things you're seeing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1803)|
| 0:30:14| would it be reasonable for the public to think that it would go, worst-case scenario, no more than $5 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1814)|
| 0:30:29| We had originally estimated that it could go as deep as $8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1829)|
| 0:30:34| However, we do have some safeguards in place because we are submitting an application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1834)|
| 0:30:40| and preliminary indications that it would be acceptable to help us fund some initiatives that we incurred in FY20 using CARES dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1840)|
| 0:30:50| And if you'll remember, what we're suggesting is that dollars over and above the $7 million with respect to the Chromebooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1850)|
| 0:30:57| we can apply that to FY20 initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1857)|
| 0:30:59| So that would help even more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1859)|
| 0:31:01| While it's not money used, we're not actually requesting dollars to stick in the bank to replenish fund balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1861)|
| 0:31:09| because I think there's a little bit of confusion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1869)|
| 0:31:11| What we're asking for is for some dollars that we can apply for expenditures that we incurred in FY20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1871)|
| 0:31:19| So that being the case, that would essentially replenish the dollars back into the bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1879)|
| 0:31:25| So on the back end, that would help our fund balance position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| I would say that what we had estimated is $4 million to $8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1888)|
| 0:31:33| I do not believe in any way that it would go any more than $8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1893)|
| 0:31:38| And at this point, I'm cautiously optimistic that it would definitely not even be more than $4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1898)|
| 0:31:47| Well, what would it do procedurally if we basically capped it right now at $5 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1907)|
| 0:32:01| I mean, what I'm getting at is that doesn't mean that if we get into a real bad situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1921)|
| 0:32:10| you couldn't come back and get two or three more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1930)|
| 0:32:15| Is that going to put you in a bind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| I don't believe it would put us in a bind from a cash perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| I think where it could get tricky is sales tax information is not in real time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1940)|
| 0:32:27| So there's a two-month lag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| And so potentially what could happen is we would be into the fund balance on the books at a certain amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1949)|
| 0:32:37| and I wouldn't want to violate that $5 million mark because we really won't know the true impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1957)|
| 0:32:43| that COVID has had on this fiscal year until about August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1963)|
| 0:32:49| And the reason for that is April, May, and June comes in in June, July, and August as far as the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1969)|
| 0:32:59| But I would say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1979)|
| 0:33:02| We will definitely keep the board informed of how it's trending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1982)|
| 0:33:06| And what we will do is we can then inform the board of, hey, we think we're safe still, and this is a safe estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1986)|
| 0:33:14| So I think what we could do is if we see something really trending in a negative direction, I'm hopeful that doesn't happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=1994)|
| 0:33:22| then we would obviously inform the board before we went too deep into fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2002)|
| 0:33:32| So the only thing is, at this point, once again, I'll say I'm optimistic that we won't even be into it that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2012)|
| 0:33:39| What I don't want to do, though, is on the back end, when we get all the information, we run the numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2019)|
| 0:33:44| we close the books, and we realize that we went into fund balance $5.1 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2024)|
| 0:33:48| and I wouldn't want an audit finding that we violated the board's intent, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2028)|
| 0:33:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2032)|
| 0:33:53| But I'm thinking about how the public perceives this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2033)|
| 0:33:58| I mean, if they just read this statement here, it's like, you know, whatever we're short, we'll make it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2038)|
| 0:34:08| Well, here, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2048)|
| 0:34:11| The dilemma we're in is we have committed to meet this year's obligations regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2051)|
| 0:34:17| And even if we put a cap on a $5 million, say, for instance, we're going into fund balance of $5 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2057)|
| 0:34:24| the reality of it is we have to meet those obligations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| And we've committed to the bulk of those obligations are payroll costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2067)|
| 0:34:32| And so the harsh reality here is we've committed to make those payments, and we're going to make them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2072)|
| 0:34:39| And so if we put a cap on fund balance, we would have to somehow or another try to find another funding source| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2079)|
| 0:34:45| to try to align with those expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2085)|
| 0:34:52| Do you have any thoughts on, like you said, it lags too much behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2092)|
| 0:34:58| Do you have any thoughts on when we would realize that it was a crisis situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2098)|
| 0:35:05| I mean, would it be February or March?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2105)|
| 0:35:08| No, no, we would know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| I would tell you that we will know within the next couple of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2110)|
| 0:35:15| So we'll know for absolutely certain by August how much we've went into fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2115)|
| 0:35:20| Okay, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2120)|
| 0:35:21| So two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2121)|
| 0:35:22| One, we have roughly $8 million before we even get to the 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2122)|
| 0:35:28| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2128)|
| 0:35:29| Well, so in March, we actually had $19 million in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2129)|
| 0:35:34| That's $4 million more than the 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2134)|
| 0:35:36| So the 3% is 3% of your operating budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2136)|
| 0:35:39| There are some things that are pulled out from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2139)|
| 0:35:41| It's probably $14 million and something, but we just rounded up to $15 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2141)|
| 0:35:45| So there's $4 million over and above that that we can use for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2145)|
| 0:35:50| I mean obviously we have to bring it to the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| but that's typically those amounts that we would bring yearly to the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2152)|
| 0:35:55| and say we want to buy textbooks with this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2155)|
| 0:35:57| And so with the $15 million, that's in a sense restricted because it's state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2157)|
| 0:36:04| The state will allow local education agencies to spend into that amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2164)|
| 0:36:10| because it is for emergency purposes, and obviously this qualifies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2170)|
| 0:36:15| The dilemma comes in is when you begin to budget for the following year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2175)|
| 0:36:19| And so there is this requirement that you meet the 3% level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2179)|
| 0:36:23| and so there is a necessity, if you will, to try to replenish those dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2183)|
| 0:36:29| So what we're really looking at is $19 million where we started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2189)|
| 0:36:35| and what we're saying is this thing could get down to as much as $7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2195)|
| 0:36:42| But even worst case scenario, we're looking at potentially $7 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2202)|
| 0:36:46| which means we would be required to replenish $8 million back up to $15 million level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2206)|
| 0:36:49| That's where we address that with a combination of to receive some help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2209)|
| 0:36:55| this current fiscal year with expenditures from CARES dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2215)|
| 0:36:58| and then we also budgeted $4 million from next year's budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2218)|
| 0:37:02| from recurring revenue to replenish the remainder of that fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2222)|
| 0:37:06| So hopefully, though, preliminary indications are encouraging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2226)|
| 0:37:10| that it won't necessarily be at that level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2230)|
| 0:37:13| Ron, one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2233)|
| 0:37:14| This says through June 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| Is that the correct date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| It sounds like it might be more like August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| June 30th is for accounting purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2240)|
| 0:37:26| Those are expenditures incurred by then, not necessarily paid at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2246)|
| 0:37:30| So it's this weird accounting stuff that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2250)|
| 0:37:35| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2255)|
| 0:37:36| Ms. Spaulding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2256)|
| 0:37:37| Yeah, and I think probably some of my stuff will go into the discussion that Ms. Hill had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2257)|
| 0:37:43| So I'm going to leave a little bit of my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| But I loved hearing the report that maybe sales tax is better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2265)|
| 0:37:50| I mean, I don't know how you're doing your job when literally daily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| I think you're getting a different report and projection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2273)|
| 0:37:56| But with this craziness that's going on, do you think maybe before each board meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2276)|
| 0:38:01| even if it's like a written report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2281)|
| 0:38:02| we could get a sense of where the sales tax, where we expected it, where we're trending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2282)|
| 0:38:06| just to give us a sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2286)|
| 0:38:07| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2287)|
| 0:38:08| Because, I mean, I love hearing it's better than we thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2288)|
| 0:38:10| And I think that would probably help all of us knowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| I think you get some detail that sometimes maybe in the past we have not worried about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2293)|
| 0:38:17| but in this crisis it would be helpful, I think, to know where it's coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2297)|
| 0:38:22| compared to the projections of where we thought it was going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| I'd be happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2305)|
| 0:38:26| And also, if the trend continues, again, I want to be really guarded in my optimism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2306)|
| 0:38:32| but if the trend continues, this is where it gets back to some of the things Mr. Thomas had mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2312)|
| 0:38:38| at our budget meeting that where we can maybe go back and address some things, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2318)|
| 0:38:42| that we couldn't do before that we would like to implement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2322)|
| 0:38:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2326)|
| 0:38:47| I'd be happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2327)|
| 0:38:48| Let's hold the rest of that conversation for the item that we then added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2328)|
| 0:38:52| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2332)|
| 0:38:53| Any other questions specifically regarding fund balance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2333)|
| 0:38:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2336)|
| 0:38:57| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2337)|
| 0:38:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2338)|
| 0:38:59| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2339)|
| 0:39:00| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2340)|
| 0:39:02| Item 10D, approved payment agreement with Dell Financial Services, LLC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2342)|
| 0:39:06| for purchase of 38,884 Chromebooks plus Chrome education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2346)|
| 0:39:11| paid in three annual payments of $3,504,272.96 beginning on July 1, 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2351)|
| 0:39:24| We have a motion by Ms. Hill, a second by Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2364)|
| 0:39:28| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2368)|
| 0:39:29| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2369)|
| 0:39:30| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2370)|
| 0:39:31| I have a question for Ms. Byard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| If we could look at the inventory we have in front of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2374)|
| 0:39:39| I'm interested to know why the Dell 3120s could not be used for one-to-one initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2379)|
| 0:39:47| They can be used for one-to-one initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2387)|
| 0:39:50| We assumed that the – keep in mind that that is the oldest model that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2390)|
| 0:39:55| in circulation in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| So by the time we deploy this one-to-one initiative at the beginning of the school year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2397)|
| 0:40:01| they will be less than a year of useful life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2401)|
| 0:40:06| So we assumed that the 3120s would become the cushion, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2406)|
| 0:40:12| that is the devices that we might issue to the terminal grade in a school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2412)|
| 0:40:17| the devices that would be used for damage, for students that forgot their device at home, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2417)|
| 0:40:24| So we took those out of the calculation, knowing that we only had one chance to get this order in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2424)|
| 0:40:30| Now, there are some adjustments we've made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2430)|
| 0:40:33| For example, we understated the enrollment because we left out early graduates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2433)|
| 0:40:38| We were using spring numbers, and we really understated the enrollment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2438)|
| 0:40:42| So some of those things are going to come out in the wash,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2442)|
| 0:40:44| and we have not sat down and allocated the actual number of the new devices to each school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2444)|
| 0:40:51| But the 3120 column, and that's the reason it's in blue, that's the older model Chromebook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2451)|
| 0:40:57| is the cushion, if you will, keeping in mind that we have to buy a new device| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2457)|
| 0:41:03| for every K-2 student because they're getting a different device.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2463)|
| 0:41:08| So all of those are new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| That's the 12,986 number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2470)|
| 0:41:14| And then we came up with a budget number of 25,898 based on the information we had at that time to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2474)|
| 0:41:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2483)|
| 0:41:24| Is that all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2484)|
| 0:41:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2485)|
| 0:41:26| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2486)|
| 0:41:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2487)|
| 0:41:28| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| Okay, all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2490)|
| 0:41:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2492)|
| 0:41:33| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2493)|
| 0:41:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2494)|
| 0:41:36| Okay, we have eight yes, one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2496)|
| 0:41:39| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2499)|
| 0:41:41| Item 10D, discussion and possible action in regard to additional funding the district may not be getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2501)|
| 0:41:47| through the BEP not yet voted on by state lawmakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2507)|
| 0:41:52| Okay, Mr. McPherson, if you want to come on back up, I know that we have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2512)|
| 0:41:59| Ms. Hill, would you like to start us off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2519)|
| 0:42:04| I was alarmed, as I know we all were, when we heard about the decrease in funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2524)|
| 0:42:11| understanding that in the state's world it was supposed to be a 2% increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2531)|
| 0:42:19| but understanding that we already meet that threshold, so that was going to be money we could use for other purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2539)|
| 0:42:28| And then we get this confirmation from you, Mr. McPherson, just about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2548)|
| 0:42:35| And what's really concerning to me is your indication, and I believe you are a very credible person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2555)|
| 0:42:44| when you say that you had assurance after assurance from the State Department of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2564)|
| 0:42:52| that this, in fact, would not happen, that the numbers that you were given were solid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2572)|
| 0:42:59| Could you just maybe start out expanding on that a little?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2579)|
| 0:43:03| Yes. So let me back up a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2583)|
| 0:43:07| So in February, the governor came out with his initial proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2587)|
| 0:43:11| It was pre-COVID. It was a 4% increase. We were working with that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2591)|
| 0:43:15| Then in March, it was adjusted down to the 2%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2595)|
| 0:43:18| And again, that 2%, 4% is just a component that they run through the salary portion within the BEP formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2598)|
| 0:43:25| It spits out the numbers and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2605)|
| 0:43:28| So it was modified again, and that was March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2608)|
| 0:43:32| We received our first BEP estimate for April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2612)|
| 0:43:35| It was very close to what our projections were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2615)|
| 0:43:38| We had done some projections, or our budget folks had done some projections about what that might look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2618)|
| 0:43:44| We were using that for budget planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2624)|
| 0:43:47| And so in March, we reached out to Department of Ed officials and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2627)|
| 0:43:51| are these numbers pretty stable? The answer we received was yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2631)|
| 0:43:54| And so we received our May estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2634)|
| 0:43:58| It was very close to the April estimate, still under the assumption of the 2%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2638)|
| 0:44:02| We reached out to ensure our thinking because this was the number we were going to use for budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2642)|
| 0:44:10| And so districts all over the state are using these numbers for their budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2650)|
| 0:44:16| And we were given assurances again that these were good numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| It would not be affected by COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2660)|
| 0:44:23| So we went with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2663)|
| 0:44:26| Also, knowing that maybe something happens, all we can go on is what we've been told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2666)|
| 0:44:33| And so, lo and behold, last week we get what we feared the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2673)|
| 0:44:40| The governor had rolled it back to no increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2680)|
| 0:44:43| Now, what the Department of Ed has told us is that they will now, and we confirmed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2683)|
| 0:44:48| we reached back out and said, you know, it was our understanding, yada, yada, yada.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2688)|
| 0:44:53| Now we think this, is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| And basically it was, yeah, you're thinking right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| So what they have indicated to us is that they will be sending the June estimate to school districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2697)|
| 0:45:05| and it's probably going to be in a couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| They're going to do two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2707)|
| 0:45:09| They're going to do a 2%, and they're going to do one without 2%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2709)|
| 0:45:14| because there's the hope, I guess, that the legislation will not approve the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2714)|
| 0:45:21| So they're going to give us two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2721)|
| 0:45:24| We really don't know what that means for us, other than we do, once again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2724)|
| 0:45:27| we went back to the drawing board, you know, ran our numbers through the formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| It's nothing official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| We looked at it several different ways, and we were getting anything between $2.6 and $2.8 million, potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2732)|
| 0:45:38| If that's the case, there is the possibility we could be back before the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2738)|
| 0:45:46| with a modified budget proposal where we are having to cut $2.7 or $2.8 million out of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2746)|
| 0:45:57| I'll go back, though, to preliminary indications for our April sales tax numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2757)|
| 0:46:05| Again, these are statewide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| We don't know what it means for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2767)|
| 0:46:10| We'll continue to reach out to the state, any information they can give us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2770)|
| 0:46:14| I will say this, that in March and April, if you add those two months together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2774)|
| 0:46:21| we are around $4 million better than what we thought we would be with those two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2781)|
| 0:46:29| If the trend continues...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2789)|
| 0:46:31| We'd be Knox County or statewide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| Yes, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2793)|
| 0:46:36| Again, based on our estimates, we have the March, we don't have the April yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2796)|
| 0:46:42| But when we run the numbers and we look at what it means for the state as a whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2802)|
| 0:46:46| what does it mean for us, we can get fairly precise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2806)|
| 0:46:50| If that trend holds up, our hope would be that any reduction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2810)|
| 0:46:55| if the legislature approves the BEP reduction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2815)|
| 0:46:58| that we could potentially cover that through increased sales tax projections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2818)|
| 0:47:03| So if it holds up, it's very preliminary at this point because, once again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2823)|
| 0:47:09| along with all other districts, we're kind of in the unknown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2829)|
| 0:47:12| So that obviously would be our biggest hope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2832)|
| 0:47:16| where we wouldn't have to go back into the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| but where we could increase the sales tax projections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2838)|
| 0:47:22| Because the thought process is if the trend is better in March and April and May and June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2842)|
| 0:47:28| that trend will continue unless we have another outbreak or another stay-at-home order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2848)|
| 0:47:33| And then that would mean that our estimates that were based on previous year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2853)|
| 0:47:38| where we thought we could actually up those a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2858)|
| 0:47:41| So we're looking at a lot of options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| We're having to, I don't want to say speculate, it sounds like we're having to guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2863)|
| 0:47:48| We're not guessing, but we're having to run a lot of calculations on our area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2868)|
| 0:47:52| to understand what this might mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| So obviously that would be our first option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2874)|
| 0:47:57| If we could realistically increase the sales tax projection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2877)|
| 0:48:00| we maybe could cover any shortage through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2880)|
| 0:48:06| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2886)|
| 0:48:09| I know that we sat here, all of us as a board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2889)|
| 0:48:12| and struggled with the changes we were already hearing were going to have to occur to cover shortfall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2892)|
| 0:48:21| We already knew about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2901)|
| 0:48:24| And I think that, Bob, you all did a remarkable, remarkable job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2904)|
| 0:48:35| Talk to me a little bit, if you could, or us a little bit, if you could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2915)|
| 0:48:38| about, it sounds like before we even start spending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2918)|
| 0:48:44| receive money and start spending for the next fiscal year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2924)|
| 0:48:47| that we are going to be paying back our rainy day fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2927)|
| 0:48:57| Well, it would be spread throughout the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2937)|
| 0:49:00| So the hope would be, so we wouldn't have to replenish that all in month one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2940)|
| 0:49:07| That's the good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2947)|
| 0:49:09| We just have to show, I think, a good faith effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2949)|
| 0:49:12| that we have actually acknowledged that there's that potential there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2952)|
| 0:49:15| that we could be in violation of the 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2955)|
| 0:49:18| So we budgeted accordingly, and I think that would suffice with the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2958)|
| 0:49:23| So the hope would be that sales tax collections would be sufficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2963)|
| 0:49:28| throughout the year where we could close an additional $4 million and replenish that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2968)|
| 0:49:33| So we won't necessarily be required, per se, to write a check to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2973)|
| 0:49:37| It would just be, as the collections come in through the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2977)|
| 0:49:40| you would be making your, theoretically, you would be making your monthly obligations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2980)|
| 0:49:44| and you would have a little bit left over in each month at the end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2984)|
| 0:49:47| and you're building it month by month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2987)|
| 0:49:50| So, and I guess this is a question for Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2990)|
| 0:49:57| So what would happen to Knox County Schools if we cannot keep that 3%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=2997)|
| 0:50:04| What are they going to do to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3004)|
| 0:50:08| Mr. Dupler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3008)|
| 0:50:12| I need to make sure I understand the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3012)|
| 0:50:14| What would the state do to the board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3014)|
| 0:50:16| I understand it is a state law that we must keep 3% of our average fund revenues in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3016)|
| 0:50:29| It's not rainy day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3029)|
| 0:50:30| What's it called again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3030)|
| 0:50:32| Is that what you call it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3032)|
| 0:50:33| Fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3033)|
| 0:50:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3034)|
| 0:50:35| Fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3035)|
| 0:50:36| That that 3% is a required amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3036)|
| 0:50:41| So if we just cannot, and I'm not suggesting this, this certainly would be a last resort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3041)|
| 0:50:49| but if we just cannot and we have to get into that again for this 2.7 or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3049)|
| 0:50:58| what is realistically, what is the state going to do to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3058)|
| 0:51:02| They going to come in and shut our school system down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3062)|
| 0:51:04| Well, I mean, I'd have to look to see exactly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3064)|
| 0:51:08| but what I could imagine would be that the state would probably first start with some type of a notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3068)|
| 0:51:15| and then after that proceed to maybe perhaps holding back some money eventually the next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3075)|
| 0:51:21| to make sure that that fund is replenished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3081)|
| 0:51:25| But I can also say in that working with state officials in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3085)|
| 0:51:31| as long as the board and the district is showing good faith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3091)|
| 0:51:35| and trying to work with its funds the best it can and maybe dip into that at one point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3095)|
| 0:51:41| but then replenish it as quickly as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3101)|
| 0:51:44| then state officials have been good to work with from that standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3104)|
| 0:51:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3109)|
| 0:51:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3110)|
| 0:51:53| So do I understand then, Mr. McPherson, that we are just still in very much a wait and see mode?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3113)|
| 0:52:02| Unfortunately, that's where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3122)|
| 0:52:05| And I will say this, I think Mr. Duper's right in what he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3125)|
| 0:52:09| that the potential is that they could just simply withhold BEP monies until you replenish it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3129)|
| 0:52:13| But also keep in mind—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3133)|
| 0:52:15| So we don't have the money to start with and they're going to withhold it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3135)|
| 0:52:18| Well, they essentially force you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3138)|
| 0:52:20| But here's the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3140)|
| 0:52:21| We've shown a good faith effort in our budget to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3141)|
| 0:52:24| Normally that's what they're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3144)|
| 0:52:27| And at year end, let's say we go all the way through the year and we are under the 3%, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3147)|
| 0:52:34| What would happen is we would go for the next year's budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3154)|
| 0:52:37| and we would once again program amounts in to try to replenish it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3157)|
| 0:52:41| So the state really has no problem with districts spending into that money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3161)|
| 0:52:46| because it is actually four times like these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3166)|
| 0:52:49| And you can spend into that 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3169)|
| 0:52:52| What they frown upon is if a district budgets into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3172)|
| 0:52:57| So, for instance, if we wanted to do great and wonderful things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3177)|
| 0:53:00| and we just said, hey, we know we don't have the recurring revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3180)|
| 0:53:03| we're going to budget fund balance and we're just going to budget all of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3183)|
| 0:53:06| even into the 3%, to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3186)|
| 0:53:08| That's what they would not allow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3188)|
| 0:53:10| So it's more on a district's intent to spend that money on the front end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3190)|
| 0:53:16| rather than having to rely on that money for emergencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3196)|
| 0:53:20| So as of now, we are still doing it all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3200)|
| 0:53:24| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3204)|
| 0:53:25| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3205)|
| 0:53:28| Just one more thing, and Jennifer, I don't mean to put you on the spot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3208)|
| 0:53:32| but as our governor's government liaison,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3212)|
| 0:53:37| I know that you have had some contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3217)|
| 0:53:39| and have still the Friday calls with our lobbyists and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3219)|
| 0:53:44| Can you give us any insight into what they're feeling in Nashville right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3224)|
| 0:53:51| They are feeling the same things we are in the other five large districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3231)|
| 0:53:56| They really feel exactly the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3236)|
| 0:54:00| They don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3240)|
| 0:54:05| And some conversations that I had had around the same time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3245)|
| 0:54:09| where the confirmation was, nope, the 2% is still there, we're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3249)|
| 0:54:13| So I think that even the Department of Ed was not aware until it was on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3253)|
| 0:54:19| Thank you for clarifying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| I think the answers we were receiving were delivered to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3261)|
| 0:54:25| based on the information they had, and I think it was genuine, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3265)|
| 0:54:28| I do. I do think it was genuine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3268)|
| 0:54:31| I don't think they were just saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| I think it was genuine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3273)|
| 0:54:34| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3274)|
| 0:54:35| I just want to, if you could address with the timeline for the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3275)|
| 0:54:39| and their budget, because I think it's the end of June that they're voting on theirs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3279)|
| 0:54:42| and with our uncertainty, are we going to possibly have to have a special call meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3282)|
| 0:54:47| What is your thought process on trying to work with the county on their vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3287)|
| 0:54:52| Chris and I talked about that just a few hours ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3292)|
| 0:54:54| We've been talking about that a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3294)|
| 0:54:56| I think the only thing we can go on at this point is the county, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3296)|
| 0:55:02| they're actually compiling their budget now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3302)|
| 0:55:06| The mayor's made his recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3306)|
| 0:55:08| I think the only thing we can actually go on is what we know now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3308)|
| 0:55:12| There hasn't been any action yet taken by the legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3312)|
| 0:55:15| Even if the legislature had taken action, if they were to take action today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3315)|
| 0:55:20| we don't know what that means for us and how we would need to modify the budget if so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3320)|
| 0:55:23| because we don't have the estimates on what BEP it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3323)|
| 0:55:27| So I think the only thing we can do is go on what we know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3327)|
| 0:55:30| The hope would be if we get some information where the legislature approves this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3330)|
| 0:55:35| and there's a reduction in BEP, I think at that point we begin to work with the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3335)|
| 0:55:40| and we say, look, this is what we're seeing from the state, preliminary indications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3340)|
| 0:55:45| Potentially it's that sales taxes are trending better than we thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3345)|
| 0:55:50| Are you seeing the same thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3350)|
| 0:55:52| We would call state officials. Yeah, we're thinking so too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| At that point we would then look at is there capacity in sales tax projections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3354)|
| 0:56:00| to raise those to try to cover some of this deficit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3360)|
| 0:56:02| So I think it would just be ongoing discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3362)|
| 0:56:04| Obviously we would have to act on it pretty quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3364)|
| 0:56:07| but we would have to work very closely with the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3367)|
| 0:56:11| because they're kind of in the same boat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3371)|
| 0:56:13| If we have to modify our budget, then once again it's the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3373)|
| 0:56:17| So just right now we're sort of thinking we're just all kind of on hold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3377)|
| 0:56:20| and they'll approve a budget and we might have to then make modifications afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3380)|
| 0:56:25| Yes, ma'am. Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3385)|
| 0:56:27| It sounds like from the trends that you're seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3387)|
| 0:56:31| that we may be able to cover it through that revenue growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3391)|
| 0:56:36| And I know you're in constant communication with Chris and county finance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3396)|
| 0:56:40| so if they're good to kind of go forward and hold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3400)|
| 0:56:45| that would be what I would recommend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3405)|
| 0:56:47| I mean, all estimates are that it will hopefully be better than we're expecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3407)|
| 0:56:52| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3412)|
| 0:56:53| So it sounds like patience would be in our favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3413)|
| 0:56:56| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3416)|
| 0:56:58| Okay. Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3418)|
| 0:57:01| I would just like to encourage each of us to contact our legislators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3421)|
| 0:57:06| This is not done yet, and most of us are on first-name basis, our delegation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3426)|
| 0:57:16| and it's very important that whether they can do it or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3436)|
| 0:57:22| that we don't sit silently and just let and just act like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3442)|
| 0:57:27| well, this is okay because it really isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3447)|
| 0:57:31| Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3451)|
| 0:57:33| I totally agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3453)|
| 0:57:34| I've got myself a note to do that, so definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3454)|
| 0:57:37| And I would remind everyone back to our opening conversation about the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3457)|
| 0:57:42| Be sure to go online and fill out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3462)|

| 0:58:01| and that's truly appreciated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3481)|

| 0:58:06| So thank you for putting that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3486)|
| 0:58:11| And I think with that, we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3491)|
| 0:58:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200610?start=3494)|
