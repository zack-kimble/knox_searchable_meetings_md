| 0:01:02| and to the republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=62)|
| 0:01:05| one nation, under God, indivisible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=65)|
| 0:01:08| with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=68)|
| 0:01:22| Thank you, Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=82)|
| 0:01:24| A couple of announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=84)|
| 0:01:26| A Joint Education Committee meeting is scheduled for Friday, May 19 at 8 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=86)|
| 0:01:33| And also, a Policy Review meeting will be following Friday, May 19 at 9 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=93)|
| 0:01:40| Both the Joint Education Committee and the Policy Review meeting will be held in this boardroom unless noted otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=100)|
| 0:01:47| And also, just a reminder for those in attendance tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=107)|
| 0:01:51| this is the only opportunity the Board has to discuss items that come before us as an elected body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=111)|
| 0:01:56| so we ask that you refrain from cheering or booing or clapping and all that good stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=116)|
| 0:02:03| And if you do want to have a conversation with someone beside you, please step outside to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=123)|
| 0:02:09| This helps us hear each other better and people at home hear us as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=129)|
| 0:02:14| And just a reminder to board members, when you do speak, to make sure you speak into your mic so people at home can hear us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=134)|
| 0:02:22| So are there any requested changes to this meeting agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=142)|
| 0:02:29| So we have a motion by Ms. Horn to approve, a second by Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=149)|
| 0:02:33| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=153)|
| 0:02:35| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=155)|
| 0:02:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=156)|
| 0:02:37| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=157)|
| 0:02:38| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=158)|
| 0:02:39| Superintendent Rice, wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=159)|
| 0:02:44| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=164)|
| 0:02:47| I would like to begin by saying to you again, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=167)|
| 0:02:51| I would like to begin by saying thank you again to the students, families, and staff at West High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=171)|
| 0:02:56| for their understanding and support following the events on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=176)|
| 0:03:00| It was a frightening situation, and we're extremely grateful that no one was seriously injured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=180)|
| 0:03:05| Chief Perriard and his team will conduct an internal after-action review of Friday's events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=185)|
| 0:03:09| so we can learn from this incident and adapt accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=189)|
| 0:03:12| That's something we do to try to continue to get better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=192)|
| 0:03:16| The last few weeks have been challenging for our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=196)|
| 0:03:19| and we know that it's understandable that people feel scared and sometimes feel helpless in these situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=199)|
| 0:03:24| I want to reiterate that we are committed to providing a safe learning environment for our students and staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=204)|
| 0:03:30| School security is a complex issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=210)|
| 0:03:32| Unfortunately, there are no easy, simple answers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=212)|
| 0:03:35| but I can promise you that we will continuously look for ways to improve our safety and security processes and procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=215)|
| 0:03:42| Next, I'd like to let you know that, as you know, in February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=222)|
| 0:03:45| I announced that Jason Myers, Assistant Superintendent of Student Success,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=225)|
| 0:03:49| would be conducting a deep-dive analysis of our special education ELL RTI services and supports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=229)|
| 0:03:56| Mr. Myers is not here tonight because he is currently at Fulton High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=236)|
| 0:04:00| kicking off our first round of regional focus groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=240)|
| 0:04:03| We have secured third-party facilitators to moderate these focus groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=243)|
| 0:04:06| so no KCS staff members will be in the room once these conversations begin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=246)|
| 0:04:10| So he'll be there for the welcome, and then we turn it over to the facilitators from that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=250)|
| 0:04:14| I look forward to hearing the final report on what families share there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=254)|
| 0:04:18| Earlier today, I also shared the names of individuals who have agreed to serve on our special education task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=258)|
| 0:04:25| I'm pleased to announce that this task force will convene their first meeting later this month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=265)|
| 0:04:29| and will meet over the course of summer to generate a set of meaningful and actionable recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=269)|
| 0:04:34| to share with our staff and to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=274)|
| 0:04:37| Again, this is a committee that I just want to say that those folks have been willing to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=277)|
| 0:04:41| and be part of that for us, and I know it's one of my committees as a superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=281)|
| 0:04:45| and a layer that I felt necessary for us to be able to get to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=285)|
| 0:04:48| So I look forward to what they have to say as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=288)|
| 0:04:51| I also want to provide an update on the formal review being conducted into the incident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=291)|
| 0:04:55| that transpired on March the 30th at Hardin Valley Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=295)|
| 0:04:59| Last month, I announced that Jennifer Hummelgarn, Assistant Superintendent of Business and Talent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=299)|
| 0:05:03| would review two items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=303)|
| 0:05:05| The scope of that work would be the actions taken by school and district leaders in response to that incident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=305)|
| 0:05:11| and the protocols and procedures that are in place to address similar situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=311)|
| 0:05:15| and whether any changes are needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=315)|
| 0:05:18| So at this time, I'd like to turn it over to Ms. Hummelgarn to give us that update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=318)|
| 0:05:22| Dr. Reiswick, Madam Chair, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=322)|
| 0:05:25| As Dr. Reiswick said, the scope of the formal review of the incident at Hardin Valley Academy on March 30, 2023| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=325)|
| 0:05:32| has focused on two items, the actions in response to the incident by school and district leaders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=332)|
| 0:05:40| and the protocols and procedures that are in place to address similar situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=340)|
| 0:05:44| and whether any changes are needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=344)|
| 0:05:47| As we've worked through the formal review, our process has crossed over into items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=347)|
| 0:05:51| that are also being investigated by the Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=351)|
| 0:05:54| Because of the ongoing criminal investigation, we're unable to provide a detailed update at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=354)|
| 0:05:59| We're grateful to the Knox County Sheriff's Office for their partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=359)|
| 0:06:02| and appreciate their efforts to keep the citizens of Knox County, including our staff and students, at KCS safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=362)|
| 0:06:08| Once we are able, we plan to provide a more specific report to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=368)|
| 0:06:15| Thank you, Ms. Hummelgarn. I'll just go a little further with that too and say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=375)|
| 0:06:19| we'll be messaging that to Hardin Valley families as well tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=379)|
| 0:06:22| because we know not everyone has a chance to watch the board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=382)|
| 0:06:25| And I want to thank you, Ms. Hummelgarn, for being thorough in that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=385)|
| 0:06:28| and also just, you know, we're talking about a lot of challenging things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=388)|
| 0:06:32| but the Sheriff's Department and Knoxville Police Department have been great partners to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=392)|
| 0:06:36| We're in conversation with members of their team daily, multiple times a day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=396)|
| 0:06:42| for multiple things that are going on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=402)|
| 0:06:44| And we do appreciate, even in this situation, that they are partners of ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=404)|
| 0:06:51| Finally, I want to provide a few updates as we approach the end of the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=411)|
| 0:06:54| As you know, our district recently completed their testing window for a variety of assessments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=414)|
| 0:06:59| including our TCAP exams. I want to thank our teachers, our staff, and families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=419)|
| 0:07:03| for your hard work over the last two weeks, helping students show that academic growth is a team effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=423)|
| 0:07:08| And our schools did an amazing job. I actually was able to be out in schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=428)|
| 0:07:11| and see that happen and see, I didn't go into any classes where they were testing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=431)|
| 0:07:15| I tried to leave them alone for that, but to go into other classes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=435)|
| 0:07:17| and talk to the staff while that was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=437)|
| 0:07:20| I also want to remind our community that graduation ceremonies for the Class of 2023| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=440)|
| 0:07:25| are scheduled from May 18th to June 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=445)|
| 0:07:28| The complete schedule is available at knoxschools.org slash seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=448)|
| 0:07:32| Looking forward to that, and as you all recall, the decision to stay at the football field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=452)|
| 0:07:37| so we will pray for dry weather when that happens, but are excited for that season kicking off soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=457)|
| 0:07:43| So we're very excited to celebrate these students and recognize their achievements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=463)|
| 0:07:46| If you're a senior, please make sure to congratulate them on a job well done if you see those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=466)|
| 0:07:50| and thank you to the seniors for the work you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=470)|
| 0:07:53| And last but not least, I want to point out that May is Teacher Appreciation Month in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=473)|
| 0:07:58| Specifically, Teacher Appreciation Day will be celebrated tomorrow, May 2nd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=478)|
| 0:08:02| and Teacher Appreciation Week will be celebrated next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=482)|
| 0:08:06| I want to thank our teachers for their tremendous effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=486)|
| 0:08:08| and encourage students and families to thank them for the month of May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=488)|
| 0:08:11| There really are an incredible group of individuals, and we couldn't do any of this without them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=491)|
| 0:08:16| Madam Chair, that concludes my report for the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=496)|
| 0:08:19| All right. Thank you, Dr. Eiswig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=499)|
| 0:08:22| I am excited. I got your email about the task force, and I am excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=502)|
| 0:08:27| And I just want to thank the people that are willing to serve on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=507)|
| 0:08:32| because I know a lot of times we put people on committees, and there's some criticisms there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=512)|
| 0:08:40| You know, we talk about the reopening committee, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=520)|
| 0:08:42| It's like, you know, one of my regrets was suggesting someone for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=522)|
| 0:08:48| because they took a lot of abuse after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=528)|
| 0:08:52| So I am very thankful and grateful for the people who signed on and are willing to help us with this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=532)|
| 0:09:01| So moving on, Ms. Horn, I believe you have an announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=541)|
| 0:09:05| Thank you, Madam Chair. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=545)|
| 0:09:07| This year's student representative selection committee process began back in February| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=547)|
| 0:09:12| with the announcement and distribution of application packets to every high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=552)|

| 0:10:52| Each year, the committee commits to interviewing the top scoring candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=652)|
| 0:10:56| taking into consideration any natural break in the scores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=656)|
| 0:11:00| This year, the top four candidates were interviewed by the selection committee on Wednesday, April 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=660)|
| 0:11:07| Once again, each committee member submitted interview scores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=667)|
| 0:11:11| which were then weighted and added to the student application scores for a grand total,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=671)|
| 0:11:16| and the top scoring student was contacted and offered the position for the 2023-2024 school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=676)|
| 0:11:24| Her term will begin on July 1st and end on June 30th, 2024,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=684)|
| 0:11:30| and I'm happy to introduce Celeste, you'll have to tell me how to pronounce your last name, Ertle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=690)|
| 0:11:36| Celeste Ertle of Bearden High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=696)|
| 0:11:40| Traditionally, the incoming board representative will sit in on the June meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=700)|
| 0:11:45| but Celeste will actually be attending Governor's School in June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=705)|
| 0:11:49| so she's sitting in today with Grace, and perhaps Thursday she can be here also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=709)|
| 0:11:54| but we will share more detail about Celeste when her term begins in July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=714)|
| 0:12:00| but I wanted to be sure and welcome Celeste and congratulate you on being appointed to serve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=720)|
| 0:12:06| and we're thankful to have you and look forward to hearing your voice as you represent the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=726)|
| 0:12:13| So thanks for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=733)|
| 0:12:17| Thank you, Ms. Horn, and welcome, Celeste. We are so glad you're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=737)|
| 0:12:22| Yes, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=742)|
| 0:12:31| And we're glad to have you back again, Grace, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=751)|
| 0:12:33| You know, Grace is our valedictorian at Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=753)|
| 0:12:37| so we'll be celebrating her later in the week with our other valedictorians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=757)|
| 0:12:42| so it's nice to have you both here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=762)|
| 0:12:46| All right, so next on the agenda, Ms. Spike, I'm going to turn it over to you because that is the ABA policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=766)|
| 0:12:56| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=776)|
| 0:13:00| This, again, it says for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=780)|
| 0:13:02| I really feel like starting this with a discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=782)|
| 0:13:06| and having the ability for us to all come together and weigh in on this is really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=786)|
| 0:13:12| I know ABA therapy can be really controversial for some and also sometimes misunderstood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=792)|
| 0:13:18| and I think that that's where conversation needs to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=798)|
| 0:13:23| Last year, last fall, Courtney Piper had reached out to me and was just kind of struggling with some stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=803)|
| 0:13:30| and being a member of the autism community and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=810)|
| 0:13:35| I have some experience and some experience with my son, so I was glad to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=815)|
| 0:13:40| and went through many meetings and kind of was really curious about how private therapy comes into Knox County schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=820)|
| 0:13:47| or doesn't come into Knox County schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=827)|
| 0:13:49| and so her group had kind of drafted this with an attorney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=829)|
| 0:13:57| and I felt that it was really important for us to go over it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=837)|
| 0:14:01| and I hope that you all would have questions, or if you do have questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=841)|
| 0:14:08| can we take questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=848)|
| 0:14:13| I'll just start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=853)|
| 0:14:14| I am not opposed to ABA therapy at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=854)|
| 0:14:18| and my only concern with this, well, first of all, with any policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=858)|
| 0:14:24| I feel like to really be in a good place it needs to go to policy review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=864)|
| 0:14:30| but I appreciate having this discussion tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=870)|
| 0:14:34| My only concern with an ABA policy specifically is I think it's limiting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=874)|
| 0:14:40| because I think if we have ABA this month that we might have another therapy that's not requested a lot next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=880)|
| 0:14:48| and then another, and I was glad to see in your update, Dr. Reiswick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=888)|
| 0:14:55| that the board's working more on an outside provider type of policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=895)|
| 0:15:00| but I think it would be a good idea to just even have the two side-by-side in policy review just to kind of hammer out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=900)|
| 0:15:07| and just to our parents here tonight, because I know there are events signed up for ABA to speak on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=907)|
| 0:15:19| after policy review there will be time for input for you to see what's come out of that meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=919)|
| 0:15:27| before the board would consider it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=927)|
| 0:15:30| So there will be that period between May 19th, and assuming we land on a good place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=930)|
| 0:15:38| and it goes to the June meeting, but we could potentially have this in place in plenty of time for the new school year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=938)|
| 0:15:46| but I would like to see a broader policy that is more comprehensive, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=946)|
| 0:15:53| and includes other therapies, if that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=953)|
| 0:15:55| I definitely agree with you, because I know that especially once one parent has something else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=955)|
| 0:16:03| that they're going to be like, well, me too, and had I known that Jason's team had been working on something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=963)|
| 0:16:10| I might have done some different things, but I hope that these can be blended together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=970)|
| 0:16:16| so that we can have a little bit more understanding of these different therapies to really help our kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=976)|
| 0:16:24| and I did, I had a meeting with Mr. Dupler, and we talked about what a process it would be for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=984)|
| 0:16:30| that it would be discussion, policy review, potential meetings, potential readings, and stuff like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=990)|
| 0:16:36| so I know that it's going to be a long process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=996)|
| 0:16:39| But I think it's, I mean, I'm, I still think it's good to have this discussion tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=999)|
| 0:16:43| because I know that parents are concerned, you know, with the timeline of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1003)|
| 0:16:49| and want to get it in place before the next school year, so, you know, I think it's good that you added it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1009)|
| 0:16:56| and we have it on tonight as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1016)|
| 0:16:59| I think Courtney had mentioned that a BCBA is in the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1019)|
| 0:17:04| and I was curious if she might be able to even give a quick description of what ABA is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1024)|
| 0:17:09| I think she signed up, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1029)|
| 0:17:11| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1031)|
| 0:17:13| Should we have that then, or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1033)|
| 0:17:17| Yes, but since we're not voting, we usually do it at the end, if that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1037)|
| 0:17:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1041)|
| 0:17:27| Ms. Edwin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1047)|
| 0:17:28| I'm sorry, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1048)|
| 0:17:29| Since it's on this agenda, wouldn't it be appropriate to do it during this meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1049)|
| 0:17:34| I'm not opposed to that, if there's no objection from board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1054)|
| 0:17:40| Objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1060)|
| 0:17:43| No objections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1063)|
| 0:17:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1064)|
| 0:17:45| So are we talking about the one that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1065)|
| 0:17:50| Yeah, I think there's only one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1070)|
| 0:17:53| BCBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1073)|
| 0:17:57| I'm open to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1077)|
| 0:18:05| Ashley, are we talking about you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1085)|
| 0:18:08| Do you want to come up and say a little bit about ABA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1088)|
| 0:18:14| ABA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1094)|
| 0:18:27| Now that conversation we had when you signed up makes sense to me now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1107)|
| 0:18:31| Sorry, my name is Ashley Drysdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1111)|
| 0:18:34| I'm a board certified behavior analyst for PBS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1114)|
| 0:18:38| I was kind of requested last second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1118)|
| 0:18:41| So ABA is a science-based effective therapy to help usually with autism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1121)|
| 0:18:46| but it can be prescribed for other diagnoses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1126)|
| 0:18:50| And we use positive and negative reinforcement to kind of shape and change behaviors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1130)|
| 0:18:58| Typically, most of the time we use positive reinforcement and negative reinforcement within schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1138)|
| 0:19:04| We do not use punishment procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1144)|
| 0:19:07| I'm definitely open to questions if you guys have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1147)|
| 0:19:15| Does anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1155)|
| 0:19:18| Maybe what would an ABA session look like, or what would it look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1158)|
| 0:19:23| and then also what would it look like in a school setting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1163)|
| 0:19:26| So a school setting, we usually have a behavior intervention plan already developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1166)|
| 0:19:30| based on a functional behavior analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1170)|
| 0:19:32| So we've determined what the functions of those maladaptive behaviors are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1172)|
| 0:19:36| and then we start to intervene on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1176)|
| 0:19:38| We collect maladaptive data behavior, so we collect data on every single behavior that's occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1178)|
| 0:19:43| Is it increasing or decreasing based on the interventions that we have prescribed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1183)|
| 0:19:48| And then we individualize those according to the setting, the person, what's working, what's not working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1188)|
| 0:19:55| And then we change if necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1195)|
| 0:20:01| If it's not working for a teacher, then we change what needs to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1201)|
| 0:20:05| If there needs to be a token economy or something like that going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1205)|
| 0:20:08| to help increase those replacement behaviors, then we do that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1208)|
| 0:20:13| Would you have a specific example?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1213)|
| 0:20:17| I know that you can't talk about children, and there's privacy and stuff there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1217)|
| 0:20:21| but something that would happen in a classroom where you would help a child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1221)|
| 0:20:27| So I've had clients that we have a lot of out-of-seat behavior, a lot of elopement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1227)|
| 0:20:32| They're running around in the classroom being very disruptive, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1232)|
| 0:20:36| So the function of that can typically be attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1236)|
| 0:20:39| They're trying to get the teacher's attention, even in a verbal reprimand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1239)|
| 0:20:43| So our replacement would be for them to gain attention appropriately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1243)|
| 0:20:46| raising the hand, tapping shoulder, those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1246)|
| 0:20:49| So we start reinforcing and shaping them raising their hand in the classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1249)|
| 0:20:54| before they're getting up and eloping in the classroom and disrupting that teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1254)|
| 0:20:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1259)|
| 0:21:03| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1263)|
| 0:21:05| So do you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1265)|
| 0:21:06| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1266)|
| 0:21:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1267)|
| 0:21:08| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1268)|
| 0:21:09| So when you say a prescription, you're talking about a medical prescription.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1269)|
| 0:21:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1272)|
| 0:21:13| But it's prescribed by a doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1273)|
| 0:21:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1274)|
| 0:21:19| So does anyone else have a question for Ashley specifically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1279)|
| 0:21:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1283)|
| 0:21:24| Daniel, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1284)|
| 0:21:25| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1285)|
| 0:21:26| I thought you were pointing to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1286)|
| 0:21:27| No, no, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1287)|
| 0:21:28| I was pointing to my light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1288)|
| 0:21:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1289)|
| 0:21:30| This guy right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1290)|
| 0:21:31| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1291)|
| 0:21:32| Can you speak a little bit about how an ABA therapist in a classroom setting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1292)|
| 0:21:38| would fit within the context of that classroom as a whole?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1298)|
| 0:21:42| So obviously you're engaging with a specific student that you're walking with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1302)|
| 0:21:46| and have been prescribed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1306)|
| 0:21:49| But tell me about how the therapist kind of, in some ways I would assume,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1309)|
| 0:21:55| kind of falls into the background of what's happening in the classroom as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1315)|
| 0:21:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1318)|
| 0:21:59| So we definitely try to not be intrusive to a teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1319)|
| 0:22:03| We're there merely to support them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1323)|
| 0:22:05| So say a teacher needs help and support getting that client to gain their attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1325)|
| 0:22:09| to complete task work, that's where we kind of step in and support them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1329)|
| 0:22:13| But our goal is not to be between the teacher and the student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1333)|
| 0:22:17| We want them to be engaged and directed onto the teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1337)|
| 0:22:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| That's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1343)|
| 0:22:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1344)|
| 0:22:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1345)|
| 0:22:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| So anything else for Ms. Ashley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1348)|
| 0:22:31| No, not for her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1351)|
| 0:22:32| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1352)|
| 0:22:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1353)|
| 0:22:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1354)|
| 0:22:35| Let me go see who's next here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1355)|
| 0:22:36| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1356)|
| 0:22:37| That's you, Mr. Reverend Butler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1357)|
| 0:22:38| Dr. Butler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1358)|
| 0:22:39| I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1359)|
| 0:22:40| This is Ms. Hohenhut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| I turned my light off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1362)|
| 0:22:46| I can wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1366)|
| 0:22:47| Yeah, I mean, it goes by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| Did I just turn my light off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1369)|
| 0:22:52| Hold on, hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1372)|
| 0:22:53| Yeah, you did turn my light off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1373)|
| 0:22:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1374)|
| 0:22:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1375)|
| 0:22:56| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1376)|
| 0:22:57| My question, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1377)|
| 0:22:58| My question is concerning the sixth paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1378)|
| 0:23:01| And I guess it falls under, if it was a heading, would be economic equity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1381)|
| 0:23:07| I do understand that there are insurance policies that pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1387)|
| 0:23:13| I think some research indicated that TennCare may pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1393)|
| 0:23:19| But what about those in between having insurance to pay for it and in the TennCare, how is it that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1399)|
| 0:23:30| Because if students are not eligible for it only because if they can afford it, it seems like it's not fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1410)|
| 0:23:39| That might be a question we need to ask Jason in policy review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1419)|
| 0:23:44| because he might have more details on how he and his team would work through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1424)|
| 0:23:50| Is that correct, Dr. Risely?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1430)|
| 0:23:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1434)|
| 0:23:55| But we can definitely make note of that and have that discussion in policy review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1435)|
| 0:24:03| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1443)|
| 0:24:04| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1444)|
| 0:24:07| I have kind of some complex reasons why I don't believe that this is appropriate, so hang with me if you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1447)|
| 0:24:13| As a teacher, I spent a lot of years trying to get medical accommodations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1453)|
| 0:24:19| They were incredibly simple accommodations that literally impacted nobody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1459)|
| 0:24:24| Yet it took years to get somebody just to sign off, yes, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1464)|
| 0:24:30| When we start putting medical decisions into educational policy, I think we're in a place where we shouldn't be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1470)|
| 0:24:44| Frankly, I think we shouldn't be talking about a policy at all because this should have happened a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1484)|
| 0:24:50| The students have a prescription.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1490)|
| 0:24:52| They have a prescription from their doctor, just like if they were taking a medication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1492)|
| 0:24:57| just like if they needed crutches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1497)|
| 0:25:00| They have been prescribed a medical intervention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1500)|
| 0:25:04| It's not an educational intervention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1504)|
| 0:25:06| We, and I mean the district, we are not qualified to question a medical diagnosis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1506)|
| 0:25:15| We are not qualified to question a medical prescription.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1515)|
| 0:25:21| And we are not qualified to create policy around a medical prescription| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1521)|
| 0:25:28| because it's going to be different for every student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1528)|
| 0:25:31| So when we are looking at medical needs for a student, we should be deferring to the physician of that student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1531)|
| 0:25:42| That's the person who should be making the medical prescription, which obviously they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1542)|
| 0:25:51| Educational interventions are different from medical interventions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1551)|
| 0:25:57| While they may crisscross and while they may be similar, we aren't qualified to question that medical diagnosis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1557)|
| 0:26:09| On that same kind of track, talking about behaviors that are disruptive like elopement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1569)|
| 0:26:16| when you have a child in a school who runs out the door every day, it's not disruptive to that classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1576)|
| 0:26:25| It's disruptive to absolutely everything in the whole school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1585)|
| 0:26:30| So anything that can be done to keep a child from running, from going out of the room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1590)|
| 0:26:39| from running around the building, that would be massively helpful for the entire staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1599)|
| 0:26:46| When a child runs out the door, everybody stops what's going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1606)|
| 0:26:54| because they have to, through whatever plan is in place, bring that child back to where they should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1614)|
| 0:27:01| And that may entail running through lots of parts of the building or outside or anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1621)|
| 0:27:11| So every person who is involved in that is disrupted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1631)|
| 0:27:15| Every classroom that's anywhere near there is disrupted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1635)|
| 0:27:19| Anything that could help with those behaviors, I can't imagine why we would not want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1639)|
| 0:27:26| And if it's a question of having one more adult in the classroom for whatever reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1646)|
| 0:27:32| I think that shows a real lack of our understanding of how many adults are in and out of every classroom every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1652)|
| 0:27:42| There was a point when I literally had 27 people who could have evaluated me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1662)|
| 0:27:50| and any one of those people or all of those people could have come in and out of my classroom any day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1670)|
| 0:27:55| Having one person with a plan and with a medical prescription,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1675)|
| 0:28:00| I can't even wrap my head around why we are refusing to accommodate the medical needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1680)|
| 0:28:09| that a child's doctor has prescribed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1689)|
| 0:28:18| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1698)|
| 0:28:19| Ms. Pike, I'm just curious if you've had a chance to speak with Jason Myers about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1699)|
| 0:28:23| and how this fits in with the task force and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1703)|
| 0:28:29| You kind of touched on that before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1709)|
| 0:28:32| Yes-ish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1712)|
| 0:28:34| I had a meeting with Jason Myers and with Karen Loy some months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1714)|
| 0:28:39| before I knew that they would be also bringing a policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1719)|
| 0:28:43| and this is one of the things I think that came out of some parents' frustration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1723)|
| 0:28:50| that they were looking to have a certified ABA, BCBA come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1730)|
| 0:28:58| and it was my understanding that Karen said that we train people in Knox County schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1738)|
| 0:29:05| and it was really confusing as to whether we actually had certified personnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1745)|
| 0:29:11| or whether they just did an online training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| which is a lot different than going to school for it versus doing an online training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1754)|
| 0:29:22| Jason, we had a really, really great conversation, and he was really open to all of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1762)|
| 0:29:28| but then that was a few months ago, so that was before I knew about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1768)|
| 0:29:34| So that's also another reason I think that this is just a part of the conversation of bringing these together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1774)|
| 0:29:41| because I don't want to speak for Courtney, and I think that she had signed up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1781)|
| 0:29:48| but one of the parts of her story that spoke to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1788)|
| 0:29:53| and that I've also experienced with my children is kind of the disconnect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1793)|
| 0:29:58| between communication of the principle understanding what we will and won't do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1798)|
| 0:30:06| and a parent being told, yes, we're going to do it, sounds amazing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1806)|
| 0:30:10| and then central office being like, no, no, no, we're definitely not going to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1810)|
| 0:30:13| and that can be really confusing for parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| and I think that's where a policy came out of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1815)|
| 0:30:18| so I completely agree with Jennifer that we shouldn't be making these medical decisions for parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1818)|
| 0:30:24| but I also think because I've also done research to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1824)|
| 0:30:29| and I do with the inequity of if you can afford it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1829)|
| 0:30:34| and I think that that's where the argument is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1834)|
| 0:30:37| where children are being taken out of school 70 to 180 days to go to these therapies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1837)|
| 0:30:46| I don't remember offhand how long or how many hours a week Courtney's child goes to therapy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1846)|
| 0:30:53| but I'm sure that she will let us know that it is many, many hours of the week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1853)|
| 0:30:57| and they miss a lot of school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1857)|
| 0:31:00| and so this would be something to keep children in school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1860)|
| 0:31:03| and still learning and still being a part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| I think that there's some middle ground there for us to figure out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1866)|
| 0:31:10| and that's kind of also why I just wanted to have a conversation so that we could find that space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1870)|
| 0:31:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1875)|
| 0:31:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1876)|
| 0:31:22| All right, so Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1882)|
| 0:31:26| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1886)|
| 0:31:27| I'm sorry, I thought my light was actually on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1887)|
| 0:31:30| Ms. Pike, thank you for elevating it and getting to the point where we're having an initial conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1890)|
| 0:31:34| Obviously, parents have been advocating for this for some months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1894)|
| 0:31:38| and I really appreciate you all continuing to lift up your collective voices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1898)|
| 0:31:42| and bringing attention to the issue and the challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1902)|
| 0:31:46| I do agree with Ms. Owen, too, that for something that's being prescribed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1906)|
| 0:31:49| I know if something's prescribed to my child for any reason, I want them to be able to have access to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1909)|
| 0:31:54| I know it gets a little bit more complicated when you're talking about that prescription being an actual human being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1914)|
| 0:32:00| that's engaging with somebody during a school day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1920)|
| 0:32:03| but that, to me, doesn't mean that we shouldn't consider that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1923)|
| 0:32:06| and figure out how to make every path possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1926)|
| 0:32:11| I don't presume to understand all the needs of a child with autism and their family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1931)|
| 0:32:17| and helping them navigate that, but as a parent with a son with sensory processing disorder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1937)|
| 0:32:23| I understand that he needs some things that other children in his educational setting doesn't need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1943)|
| 0:32:29| and I want him to have access to that within all reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1949)|
| 0:32:33| I do think that probably the best way to handle this is not a specific policy about a specific therapy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1953)|
| 0:32:41| but I do think it's about how do we create a policy that allows for the appropriate access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1961)|
| 0:32:46| to individual medical and therapeutic interventions for individual children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1966)|
| 0:32:52| that can accommodate lots of different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1972)|
| 0:32:55| This is certainly a starting place, and I'm looking forward to having the larger conversation and policy review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1975)|
| 0:33:00| and would want us to act in haste to be able to get this done in time for this coming school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1980)|
| 0:33:07| We've heard over and over this year how many of the students that are represented by the parents who have come out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1987)|
| 0:33:14| have missed tremendous amounts of school, and I understand why that choice would be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=1994)|
| 0:33:21| All of us want our kids to be able to learn in an educational setting, but at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2001)|
| 0:33:27| I also have to be thinking about my child in terms of what's best for them lifelong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2007)|
| 0:33:32| and from what I understand from my limited knowledge, to be able to have access to this therapy ongoing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2012)|
| 0:33:38| is going to have a lifelong impact on these children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2018)|
| 0:33:42| It's like telling somebody who doesn't make ends meet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2022)|
| 0:33:48| are you going to pay your rent today or are you going to buy food?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2028)|
| 0:33:51| It's a tough choice, and I've got to make the one that I think is best for my kid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2031)|
| 0:33:56| and I think that's what parents have been doing, and I think what I'm hearing parents say collectively is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2036)|
| 0:34:01| we don't want to have to make that choice anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2041)|
| 0:34:03| We don't want to have to make the choice whether or not our kid accesses this therapy that's really important for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2043)|
| 0:34:09| versus being in an educational setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| I think what they're asking for is both, and I think that's reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2051)|
| 0:34:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| I would agree with that, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2057)|
| 0:34:19| I would even say if the board felt like we were in a good place coming out of that May 19th policy review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2059)|
| 0:34:28| I would even maybe suggest approving it on first reading to give people time to get what they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2068)|
| 0:34:35| lined up before the first of the year, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| I do think we have time, and I think it's good that we're having this discussion now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2078)|
| 0:34:42| so that we can make sure that we get that information out prior to August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2082)|
| 0:34:52| Ms. Spike, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2092)|
| 0:34:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2093)|
| 0:34:54| Yeah, I just want to add a little bit of my personal story that my son went through early intervention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2094)|
| 0:35:01| and I was even married at the time and had a very supportive partner where I didn't have to work at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2101)|
| 0:35:11| and we attended four therapies a week that couldn't be scheduled all in the same day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2111)|
| 0:35:17| so it was four days a week for a year and a half of therapies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2117)|
| 0:35:20| and they only occurred during business hours, and that was really, really difficult,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2120)|
| 0:35:25| the transportation, not being able to work because I was prioritizing my son| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2125)|
| 0:35:31| and then also having another child and having to find child care or bringing them with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2131)|
| 0:35:36| and I expect that some of these parents are also having the same situation where they're having to leave work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2136)|
| 0:35:43| pick up their child from school, take them to the therapy, bring them back potentially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2143)|
| 0:35:47| and all of that stuff, so I think that those are also things to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2147)|
| 0:35:52| Ms. Thorne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| I think you made the point already, and I think Mr. Watson made it too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2156)|
| 0:35:59| about just looking at, I think maybe we've heard it several times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2159)|
| 0:36:03| looking at this from a bigger perspective because I want to know, that's one of the questions I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2163)|
| 0:36:08| is what are the other ripple effects or other things that we may not be thinking of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2168)|
| 0:36:13| if we just look at a policy just for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| So I like what I think Ms. Owen said and Mr. Watson about looking at it more broadly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2176)|
| 0:36:22| because, you know, there will be other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2182)|
| 0:36:25| so I think we need to make sure that whatever is reviewed is comprehensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2185)|
| 0:36:29| so that we have an answer for this and other like issues that will come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2189)|
| 0:36:36| Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2196)|
| 0:36:37| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2197)|
| 0:36:38| I assume basically the end result of this task force and all of that is to find the answer to these questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2198)|
| 0:36:48| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2208)|
| 0:36:49| And we'll ultimately get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2209)|
| 0:36:50| Do we have an estimated kind of end date of all of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2210)|
| 0:36:55| Thank you, Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| So I sent some of this in an update to you all last week, but so all these things are a process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2217)|
| 0:37:04| and so, I mean, I'm glad the discussion's happening among the board too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2224)|
| 0:37:08| and I want to say, you know, kudos to Jason and Dr. Loy in there because they, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2228)|
| 0:37:14| they've inherited a system and it takes a lot to be willing to look into that to try to get better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2234)|
| 0:37:19| and I think they really are doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| So much so, too, that their plan is to bring exactly what you guys are describing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2241)|
| 0:37:26| I know it's not ñ I haven't seen a finished version of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2246)|
| 0:37:29| and I know Mr. Dupler will see it too as they process through to get ready for the 19th, but that is the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2249)|
| 0:37:34| So I think we have a couple things going on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| We have kind of this deep dive that will continue, you know, with the name of the task force today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2257)|
| 0:37:42| We're part of that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2262)|
| 0:37:43| We have an educator portal that's open, the focus groups that we talked about that are happening right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2263)|
| 0:37:47| but we also reserve the right to get smarter, and so in the middle of that we don't have to wait until the end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2267)|
| 0:37:54| and I think this is one of those cases where our staff feels very strongly that we don't have to wait for the final recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2274)|
| 0:38:00| whenever those come, but if there's something that we need to move forward on, that we would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2280)|
| 0:38:04| So I think it's a both-and.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| I think there will be some things that we see through the process that we'll bring to you all before that process is complete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2286)|
| 0:38:12| and I think there will be some other things that will be probably recommendations that may not be a, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2292)|
| 0:38:17| policy fix or a shift in staff fix,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2297)|
| 0:38:20| but it may be something that is probably a longer journey that we have to try to look at and build around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2300)|
| 0:38:24| So I think you'll see both of those in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2304)|
| 0:38:26| Our hope is the task force, you know, to be able to come and be part of probably early fall, that kind of thing, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2306)|
| 0:38:32| and, again, we'll see what happens once they start meeting, you know, later this month and kind of have those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2312)|
| 0:38:37| but, again, there are other pieces to this from the focus groups, from the educator portal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2317)|
| 0:38:43| and then also us just researching and taking a close look, too, that will be part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2323)|
| 0:38:47| So I don't know if we'll have an end date that it's all done and then we'll start moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2327)|
| 0:38:51| I think we'll continue to bring things to you all as we see, you know, the need for that and discover a way to be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2331)|
| 0:38:57| Sounds good. Thank you. I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2337)|
| 0:39:02| All right. Does anyone have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2342)|
| 0:39:05| So, Ms. Spike, it sounds like we're all good with just moving forward to May 19th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2345)|
| 0:39:09| and having a more in-depth discussion at that time, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2349)|
| 0:39:13| All right. Okay. Perfect. And thank you for adding this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2353)|
| 0:39:20| All right. So before we go into the discussion of our May 4th regular session agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2360)|
| 0:39:26| board members, you received an email this morning that I wanted to alert you that Superintendent Reiswick and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2366)|
| 0:39:32| agreed to the addition of item 10A, which is consideration of an addendum to our current contract with TRA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2372)|
| 0:39:41| for our school accounting software due to its time sensitive nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2381)|
| 0:39:46| And as always, we can entertain questions and discussions as we review the rest of the regular session agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2386)|
| 0:39:52| So with that, I'm sorry, I need to get my glasses on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2392)|
| 0:39:58| I can't see. It's probably obvious I can't see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2398)|
| 0:40:03| All right. So going into that agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2403)|
| 0:40:11| Item 7A or B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2411)|
| 0:40:21| Are we good? Item C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2421)|
| 0:40:30| Going into contracts. Item D. Items 1 or 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2430)|
| 0:40:40| 3 or 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2440)|
| 0:40:46| 5 or 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2446)|
| 0:40:52| 7 or 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2452)|
| 0:40:55| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2455)|
| 0:40:56| Thank you, Madam Chair. I have some concerns about number 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2456)|
| 0:41:00| And Dr. Reiswick and I talked about the iTeach program several months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2460)|
| 0:41:05| I just want to be sure that it's on everybody's radar as something that says that there is support for the student teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2465)|
| 0:41:15| or the teacher who is becoming certified, but that support is far away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2475)|
| 0:41:22| And so if we are going to be using the iTeach program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2482)|
| 0:41:26| I would very strongly recommend that we put a very strong mentor in place for each of those potential teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2486)|
| 0:41:34| because there's not one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2494)|
| 0:41:36| I mean, they can call Dallas and talk to a person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2496)|
| 0:41:40| But I've seen a couple of versions of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2500)|
| 0:41:47| Some of them quit after a couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2507)|
| 0:41:50| Some of them go on for the whole year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2510)|
| 0:41:52| And in each of the cases that I've talked to, the difference has been how much support they had right there at their school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2512)|
| 0:42:01| So if we just put them into the school and depend on iTeach to mentor them, that's not really going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2521)|
| 0:42:09| Yes, they have classes through iTeach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2529)|
| 0:42:11| Yes, they have high expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2531)|
| 0:42:15| But that personal mentoring where you can reach out to that person in your school is not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2535)|
| 0:42:22| Ms. Timmel-Garden, did you want to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2542)|
| 0:42:26| Madam Chair, Ms. Owen, you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| It is a virtual program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2548)|
| 0:42:30| But the candidate or the employee of KCS would also have the same mentorship as first-year teachers in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2550)|
| 0:42:39| Mr. Moseman is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| I don't have additional information on additional mentorship, but we will keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2561)|
| 0:42:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2567)|
| 0:42:52| So items 8 or 9?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2572)|
| 0:42:58| 10 or 11?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2578)|
| 0:43:02| I don't know who was first over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2582)|
| 0:43:04| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| Mr. Triplett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2586)|
| 0:43:08| Item 10, the East Tennessee Freedom Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2588)|
| 0:43:11| Just a little bit of research into that organization and their parent organization, the Children's Defense Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2591)|
| 0:43:20| They may do well with reading, but they also have a pretty strong alternative agenda that they're promoting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2600)|
| 0:43:30| and seem to be using the Freedom Schools as part of that avenue with which to promote that agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2610)|
| 0:43:36| And it is not one that I can support, nor do I think would be beneficial to the students of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2616)|
| 0:43:43| And so I just would encourage you to vote against giving them access to the students in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2623)|
| 0:43:53| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2633)|
| 0:43:58| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2640)|
| 0:44:01| Actually, Ms. Denise Dean is here from Freedom Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2641)|
| 0:44:05| Ms. Dean, would you mind coming and speaking a little bit to the work of Freedom Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2645)|
| 0:44:10| and especially its history within engaging Knox County school students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2650)|
| 0:44:16| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| I am the Executive Director of East Tennessee Freedom Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2662)|
| 0:44:25| We're about to start our seventh summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2665)|
| 0:44:28| Freedom Schools is a literacy and empowerment program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2668)|
| 0:44:31| and we serve elementary children as well as middle schoolers at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2671)|
| 0:44:35| Our morning is focused on literacy from typically 8 to 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2675)|
| 0:44:41| I'm sorry, 9 to 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| And in the afternoons, we have broadening experiences from STEM to music to math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2684)|
| 0:44:51| We started teaching phonics in our afternoon program, self-care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2691)|
| 0:44:56| We'll actually have the Girl Scouts with us this summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2696)|
| 0:44:59| That's what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2701)|
| 0:45:02| And can you speak a little bit to the name, Freedom Schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2702)|
| 0:45:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2706)|
| 0:45:07| Freedom Schools, as someone kind of noted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2707)|
| 0:45:12| Freedom Schools is a franchise that's under the umbrella of the Children's Defense Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2712)|
| 0:45:17| And the Children's Defense Fund is a national organization that focuses on children's policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2717)|
| 0:45:22| around education, health, moral development, things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2722)|
| 0:45:28| And the founder of the Children's Defense Fund, Mary Wright Edelman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2728)|
| 0:45:33| she has been involved in the civil rights efforts throughout the 60s and into the 70s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2733)|
| 0:45:39| part of the Poor People's Movement, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2739)|
| 0:45:42| So she founded the Children's Defense Fund in 1973.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| And then in 1995, she started the Freedom Schools program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2745)|
| 0:45:48| And the Freedom Schools program was built on the model of freedom riders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2748)|
| 0:45:54| So when college students in the 60s went down south to help more rural people of color| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2754)|
| 0:46:00| get smarter about English and math and everything else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2760)|
| 0:46:04| to augment what they had experienced in their own school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2764)|
| 0:46:09| it made a difference in terms of their ability to be able to be fully engaged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2769)|
| 0:46:12| in the offerings of citizenship and voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2772)|
| 0:46:15| And so she took that model, and that was the foundation of Freedom Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2775)|
| 0:46:21| Can you tell me why, in your mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| you've been running Freedom Schools in Knox County since the beginning, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2783)|
| 0:46:26| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2786)|
| 0:46:27| So why do you think it's important to have an option like Freedom Schools for students here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2787)|
| 0:46:32| as an alternative to, you know, there's other youth development programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2792)|
| 0:46:36| and literacy programs, summer programs that are very good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| that people know and have been involved with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2798)|
| 0:46:41| So why is Freedom Schools important in terms of being an option for students in our community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2801)|
| 0:46:46| Yeah, so again, we're coming up to our seventh summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2806)|
| 0:46:50| When I started Freedom Schools here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2810)|
| 0:46:53| and this is not the first time Freedom Schools has been in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2813)|
| 0:46:56| Thrive was a Freedom School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2816)|
| 0:46:59| Tribe One was a Freedom School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| This has one in Oak Ridge years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2821)|
| 0:47:04| I just wanted to help children be better academically and socially, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2824)|
| 0:47:10| And what I learned as I started that initiative in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2830)|
| 0:47:15| because you have to raise money for this, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2835)|
| 0:47:16| This is a free program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| And I said, so what's the argument for Freedom Schools in this area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2838)|
| 0:47:21| The argument is, in addition to my own desires, was just the literacy rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2841)|
| 0:47:26| It was very poor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2846)|
| 0:47:29| And it was extremely poor for black, Latino, and economically disadvantaged children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2849)|
| 0:47:35| So that is, by chance, the people that we serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2855)|
| 0:47:39| And what we find is not only is it about helping children get better at reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2859)|
| 0:47:46| and comprehension and reasoning and problem solving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2866)|
| 0:47:49| There's a whole lot that goes into their own self-confidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2869)|
| 0:47:53| One of our aims is to help children fall in love with reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2873)|
| 0:47:57| as well as helping them understand all the ways that they can make a difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2877)|
| 0:48:02| for themselves, their family, their community, and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2882)|
| 0:48:08| We tell them there's only two ways to make a difference in America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2888)|
| 0:48:13| It's either your vote, and all of our staff are registered voters, or it's your voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2893)|
| 0:48:17| And for our children, that's what they have is their voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2897)|
| 0:48:20| So we want to help them better understand what's going on in the world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2900)|
| 0:48:24| and be clear about some of the challenges that exist for them and their families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2904)|
| 0:48:29| and think about ways to address those challenges in a productive way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2909)|
| 0:48:35| Well, Ms. Dean, you and I have been engaging for years out in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2915)|
| 0:48:40| and I appreciate all the work that you're in in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2920)|
| 0:48:43| and appreciate the work that you've been doing with Freedom Schools and continue to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2923)|
| 0:48:47| I know Ms. Satterfield, one of our previous board members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2927)|
| 0:48:50| was very involved even prior to her time with Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2930)|
| 0:48:55| So thank you for that work, and thank you for providing that alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2935)|
| 0:48:58| And I appreciate the heritage, from what I understand, of Freedom Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2938)|
| 0:49:02| and being something that's come out of the civil rights movement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2942)|
| 0:49:05| and continuing to keep that legacy alive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2945)|
| 0:49:08| If I could add one more point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2948)|
| 0:49:12| We talk about Freedom Schools as one of the things that helped stem summer learning loss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2952)|
| 0:49:17| as all of you know, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2957)|
| 0:49:19| Kids leave in the spring, come back in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2959)|
| 0:49:21| It's like someone put a hole in their head and stuff fell out, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| And what we found is that we do pre- and post-assessment with our children on comprehension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2964)|
| 0:49:30| and on average over our six years, 87 percent of our children either maintain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2970)|
| 0:49:35| or improve their reading instructional level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2975)|
| 0:49:38| So we have a great track record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| We have 30 to 50 percent of our scholars who join us every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2980)|
| 0:49:44| We have middle school now because kids have grown up with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2984)|
| 0:49:48| and their families want to continue this journey, and it's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2988)|
| 0:49:52| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2992)|
| 0:49:53| Would there be an opportunity this summer for board members who have an interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2993)|
| 0:49:57| to come out and see what you're doing in Freedom Schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2997)|
| 0:49:59| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=2999)|
| 0:50:00| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3000)|
| 0:50:01| One other thing I would share is our day starts with breakfast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3001)|
| 0:50:05| but we start by greeting the scholars in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3005)|
| 0:50:07| Then we have breakfast, and then we have something that is akin to a pep rally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3007)|
| 0:50:10| We call it Harambee, which is a Kiswahili word for let's all pull together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3010)|
| 0:50:15| And during that time, members of the community come in and read aloud to our scholars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3015)|
| 0:50:19| We have cheers and chants and a motivational song.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3019)|
| 0:50:22| We have recognition, things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3022)|
| 0:50:25| And one summer, I believe it was in 2018, when we were at Sarah Moore Green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3025)|
| 0:50:29| the third grade pod from Sarah Moore Green was in the school doing a summer reading camp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3029)|
| 0:50:35| and they heard us in the morning, and they're like, what are you doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3035)|
| 0:50:39| And they wanted to come up and see, and they came up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3039)|
| 0:50:42| and they started doing it in their program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3042)|
| 0:50:45| Then the magic, though, was when they took it back to their school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3045)|
| 0:50:49| and as you know, absenteeism is one of the biggest challenges we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3049)|
| 0:50:53| and when they started doing Harambee with their students in that third grade pod,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3053)|
| 0:50:58| there are a lot of reasons for absenteeism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3058)|
| 0:51:01| but the numbers plummeted in terms of people not showing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3061)|
| 0:51:05| Kids wanted to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3065)|
| 0:51:07| So there were things about Freedom School that I would offer to you that's similar to charter schools, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3067)|
| 0:51:12| If there's something really good going on, you have an opportunity as a public school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3072)|
| 0:51:17| to kind of wrap your arms around it and see how you can leverage that in service to your interests at school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3077)|
| 0:51:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3082)|
| 0:51:25| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3087)|
| 0:51:28| I guess this is a question for Dr. Reiswick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3088)|
| 0:51:30| Is there any cost to Knox County Schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3090)|
| 0:51:36| Thank you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3096)|
| 0:51:37| Actually, Dr. Wilson is probably more familiar with the parts of the MOU for this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3097)|
| 0:51:42| so I'll let him address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3102)|
| 0:51:45| Yeah, so again, just to say a little bit about the MOU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3105)|
| 0:51:48| I think that the genesis of it was kind of rooted in data sharing, I think, at the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3108)|
| 0:51:53| So as Ms. Dean has mentioned, we've had summer programming for several summers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3113)|
| 0:51:58| where Knox County students participate with Freedom Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3118)|
| 0:52:01| but that's been handled primarily through more of like a facilities use kind of agreement that that's occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3121)|
| 0:52:07| So having the memorandum of understanding has expanded in a couple of ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3127)|
| 0:52:10| one of those being in data sharing, and she's mentioned some of the tracking they do for their students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3130)|
| 0:52:15| and that information as far as like reading growth and retention of those reading skills over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3135)|
| 0:52:22| The other piece of that is allowing them to take advantage of transportation that's already occurring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3142)|
| 0:52:27| in moving to and transporting students to our summer programming at those sites where they're going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3147)|
| 0:52:33| and so there's some contingencies in the MOU around transportation, if space is available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3153)|
| 0:52:39| and traveling from those zones to those schools where students will be participating in the summer learning program with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3159)|
| 0:52:45| So the cost, there is cost, it's in those buses that we are already using and transporting students on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3165)|
| 0:52:52| and again, dependent upon availability of seats on those buses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3172)|
| 0:52:56| we'd be able to provide transportation to some participants from the summer program for Freedom Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3176)|
| 0:53:03| Okay, so we've already been having these in our schools through facilities use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3183)|
| 0:53:09| The difference in this MOU is that we are working with them on transportation that we're already providing to other students anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3189)|
| 0:53:18| and sharing data sharing so that they can better track whether they are, how well they are improving learning loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3198)|
| 0:53:28| That's what I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3208)|
| 0:53:29| Okay. Do you have any concern at all about potential conflict of interest because a former board member was involved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3209)|
| 0:53:38| I mean, the former board member's involvement in any of the conversations that started around, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3218)|
| 0:53:46| conversations with Ms. Dean and staff here in Knox County around ways to capitalize and expand on providing service to students in the summer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3226)|
| 0:53:55| has been free from Ms. Hevey's involvement as far as I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3235)|
| 0:53:58| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3238)|
| 0:54:02| Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3242)|
| 0:54:03| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3243)|
| 0:54:05| Thank you, Ms. Dean, for going through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3245)|
| 0:54:08| I really do appreciate the focus on literacy, and we know that's certainly important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3248)|
| 0:54:13| My concern, and I think I have gotten some emails from some community members about the Children's Defense Fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3253)|
| 0:54:21| and so in my research of that, one of my concerns is just really around curriculum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3261)|
| 0:54:27| And I know, I do remember that we've had these in the past, but when somebody raised this concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3267)|
| 0:54:33| I started doing a little research, and so their push on, I'm looking at the National Reading Month book list for March,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3273)|
| 0:54:44| and it has some concerning curriculum in their reading list, such as the 1619 Project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3284)|
| 0:54:52| and you guys probably remember a book called Something Happened in Our Town from a couple years ago that was an issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3292)|
| 0:54:59| and that's just a couple of them that I recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3299)|
| 0:55:03| So that's my concern is the curriculum and what that curriculum would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3303)|
| 0:55:11| Is this completely separate, or is this something that the curriculum is submitted to KCS?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3311)|
| 0:55:20| Can you talk about that, Dr. Wilson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3320)|
| 0:55:23| Yes, so we actually did reach out to get a little more clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3323)|
| 0:55:26| Julie Thompson was part of the team that worked on the MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3326)|
| 0:55:30| It was actually Laura Denton and Dr. Liz Norton had kind of started that conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3330)|
| 0:55:35| but then Julie kind of helped with her piece being the planning of the summer learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3335)|
| 0:55:39| So that to be said, I had Julie reach out this afternoon because, again, this MOU does present a shift| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3339)|
| 0:55:45| in terms of how we've provided Freedom Schools service in the past to our schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3345)|
| 0:55:49| which has really just been sort of external to the district coming in, using the facility as lots of different organizations do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3349)|
| 0:55:56| And so with the addition of the transportation, one of the asks that we have made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3356)|
| 0:56:01| because it does change the stance of Knox County a little bit in terms of providing that resource of the transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3361)|
| 0:56:08| and helping students get to access the program, we've asked them to provide that materials list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3368)|
| 0:56:15| and text list for the parents who sign their students up for the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3375)|
| 0:56:19| which would be in line with our expectations that we do under our policies that we do for all of our classes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3379)|
| 0:56:27| in terms of providing syllabi and curriculum and materials lists that students will have access to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3387)|
| 0:56:33| So we've asked them and they've agreed to provide those text lists for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3393)|
| 0:56:36| for the grade levels of students that would be participating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3396)|
| 0:56:39| and then, again, to have agreed that they would follow the policies that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3399)|
| 0:56:43| as far as content and information that's shared through our supplemental materials and materials in our classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3403)|
| 0:56:52| And when do you expect to have that curriculum list from them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3412)|
| 0:56:56| Well, again, what we've asked was for them to be able to share that with parents who register for the program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3416)|
| 0:57:00| prior to the start of the program. That's been the request thus far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3420)|
| 0:57:06| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3426)|
| 0:57:11| Dr. Butler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3431)|
| 0:57:13| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3433)|
| 0:57:16| So, Dr. Wilson, what I'm hearing is that they will be complying with the Knox County Schools policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3436)|
| 0:57:24| when it comes to the area of concern of those particular books?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3444)|
| 0:57:29| Yes, sir. Our ask was, again, to provide those materials so that we're transparent with parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3449)|
| 0:57:33| as they make a choice about programming, and then, too, to be aware of those policies that guide content| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3453)|
| 0:57:39| that's included in our classrooms and to adhere to those policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3459)|
| 0:57:43| And they have agreed to adhere to the policies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3463)|
| 0:57:45| My understanding is yes, after Ms. Thompson's conversation today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3465)|
| 0:57:49| So if it's appropriate, I'd like to ask, what is it that, other than those books,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3469)|
| 0:57:55| because it sounds like whatever that book list is, whatever the curriculum question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3475)|
| 0:57:59| is that it will be reviewed by Knox County personnel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3479)|
| 0:58:03| and if it's not in compliance with Knox County Schools, then it wouldn't be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3483)|
| 0:58:08| So what other issues or areas is there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3488)|
| 0:58:18| Mr. Triplett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3498)|
| 0:58:20| So just, they have a blog post dated March where they celebrate what they call banned books,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3500)|
| 0:58:28| and they list the content that is in those banned books, and one of the things that they list is sexual encounters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3508)|
| 0:58:35| And so I just, you know, that concerned me as something that I didn't feel was appropriate for Knox County students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3515)|
| 0:58:42| And if that's the organization that's leading this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3522)|
| 0:58:45| I certainly wouldn't want them, as part of their literacy effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3525)|
| 0:58:48| to provide that kind of content to students in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3528)|
| 0:58:53| So that was one of the primary issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3533)|
| 0:58:57| And they list on that blog several other things that are concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3537)|
| 0:59:01| I mean, they are very, very focused on, they have, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3541)|
| 0:59:06| they are very proud of the fact that a large percentage of their books have certain themes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3546)|
| 0:59:11| and LGBTQ themes and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3551)|
| 0:59:14| So I just have some concern around them using that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3554)|
| 0:59:19| I think that the heart for literacy is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3559)|
| 0:59:22| I think that's certainly a need and something we would all support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3562)|
| 0:59:25| I just think that you can do that in a way without having content that I would deem inappropriate for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3565)|
| 0:59:33| So just, and I appreciate you sharing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3573)|
| 0:59:37| but just to make sure, if those things are in violation of Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3577)|
| 0:59:42| then they would be told that and they've already said that they would follow what Knox County Schools policy is, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3582)|
| 0:59:48| Yes, but so just to clarify, because again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3588)|
| 0:59:51| what we've asked for is a list of those materials to be provided for parents who are signing students up for those programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3591)|
| 0:59:57| There is not a formal review process of all of the Freedom Schools curriculum on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3597)|
| 1:00:02| And our policy, as we follow for classrooms where we may be dealing with content that parents find questionable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3602)|
| 1:00:09| or a staff member finds questionable or a student raises is questionable, that happens through a challenge process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3609)|
| 1:00:14| So that is on the back end. That's not on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3614)|
| 1:00:17| There's not a there's not a plan at this time for a full scale review of the curriculum of Freedom Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3617)|
| 1:00:22| So I want to make sure I'm understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3622)|
| 1:00:26| So the requirement for Freedom Schools that we would apply here is inconsistent with the policy of Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3626)|
| 1:00:39| The policy of Knox County Schools is that the parents and or students that are enrolled into the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3639)|
| 1:00:48| if they find something that they think is inconsistent with what they want their children to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3648)|
| 1:00:54| they can raise that issue and at that time it would initiate a review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3654)|
| 1:00:59| Yes, sir. And I'll say this, too, like the way materials find their way into adoption and classrooms in a school district has a process that is established that begins at the state level and flows down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3659)|
| 1:01:12| We are our policies aren't necessarily currently crafted specifically towards like summer learning providers and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3672)|
| 1:01:20| They have agreed to participate and to try to mirror the policies as much as possible as they can with the curriculum that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3680)|
| 1:01:30| So thank you so much. The other question I would ask is the Web site that you reviewed was the East Tennessee Freedom Schools Web site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3690)|
| 1:01:47| It is it is the Children's Defense Fund's Web site, which is the parent organization of Freedom Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3707)|
| 1:01:55| So and let me ask Miss Dean if she would come back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3715)|
| 1:02:12| So, Miss Dean, do you receive curriculum directions and guidelines from the Children's Defense Fund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3732)|
| 1:02:23| Yes. So do you have to do what they tell you to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3743)|
| 1:02:27| I'm a franchise. OK, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3747)|
| 1:02:30| So the documentation he's talking about, is that something that you all do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3750)|
| 1:02:35| Say that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3755)|
| 1:02:36| The information that Mr. Triplett has brought up, is that the information you all use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3756)|
| 1:02:42| Some of those books have been in our curriculum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3762)|
| 1:02:44| OK. And so in the information, has any parents ever had a complaint about it or a concern about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3764)|
| 1:02:53| No. I mean, you come to Freedom Schools because you want to come to Freedom Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3773)|
| 1:02:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3776)|
| 1:02:57| It's not mandatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3777)|
| 1:02:58| OK. Thank you. So thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3778)|
| 1:03:02| So this is my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3782)|
| 1:03:11| We have schools in the district, Knox County schools, that are on the state list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3791)|
| 1:03:23| We have a program that's been offered for seven years to help with literacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3803)|
| 1:03:30| Students and the parents who are attending the school don't have an issue with the curriculum that's provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3810)|
| 1:03:38| Number one, they're happy that their kids have a summer program that's free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3818)|
| 1:03:45| Not only is it free, it's effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3825)|
| 1:03:48| And it's also providing food, education, and socialization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3828)|
| 1:03:55| I can tell you that the Knoxville Interdenominational Christian Ministerial Alliance has supported Freedom Schools for those seven years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3835)|
| 1:04:08| providing money and resources, supplement for food and volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3848)|
| 1:04:18| This is a part of our community that we know we need to help our students move forward in school, especially with this new third grade retention law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3858)|
| 1:04:34| I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3874)|
| 1:04:37| I have a concern about the access to music, internet content, books, and even what we see on our streets that causes our kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3877)|
| 1:04:57| causes concerns if our kids were to adopt some of these ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3897)|
| 1:05:04| And my concern may not be someone else's concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3904)|
| 1:05:07| Someone may be concerned that they may adopt my ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3907)|
| 1:05:10| But the point I'm making here is this is a proven program that our community needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3910)|
| 1:05:18| And I think it would be a shame if this board does not approve this contract that this community has come to count on and utilize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3918)|
| 1:05:33| I can assure you that I know a number of the parents and a number of the teachers who are not going to give kids information that's going to cause them harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3933)|
| 1:05:45| I know them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3945)|
| 1:05:47| But what I also know is that, well, I won't say I know it, but I would be, let me just ask, have you visited the Freedom School?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3947)|
| 1:05:57| Have you observed the Freedom School?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3957)|
| 1:06:00| Do you know what the Freedom School provides?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3960)|
| 1:06:04| It's really time to support the needs of the community that I come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3964)|
| 1:06:16| We feel like a great deal of time we've got to fight for a lot of the simple things that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3976)|
| 1:06:23| Now, I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3983)|
| 1:06:25| I'm not saying your concern is not valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3985)|
| 1:06:27| But listen, in this situation, we know we have kids that need this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3987)|
| 1:06:36| It's just simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3996)|
| 1:06:38| We have a great need here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=3998)|
| 1:06:41| And we've got to fight for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4001)|
| 1:06:48| I'm going to beseech you, brothers and sisters, to really look at this for what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4008)|
| 1:07:00| I will not say I agree with everything that anybody teaches or preaches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4020)|
| 1:07:06| But I do know that this is a great need here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4026)|
| 1:07:11| So as the school board representative that comes out of this community, I can tell you I will vote for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4031)|
| 1:07:17| And I will ask every one of you to vote for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4037)|
| 1:07:20| We need this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4040)|
| 1:07:24| It has provided for these kids for seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4044)|
| 1:07:29| And every time, we have community support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4049)|
| 1:07:32| We have people going there and carrying things there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4052)|
| 1:07:35| So the way that they're able to do it for free is not because they have money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4055)|
| 1:07:40| It's because they have people who are willing to support this effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4060)|
| 1:07:44| So if you want to anger a community, vote it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4064)|
| 1:07:50| Because the community will be upset and will be angry because we have a program that we're not asking you to pay for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4070)|
| 1:07:58| You're going to have kids getting on a bus that's already rolling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4078)|
| 1:08:03| Classrooms that's already being provided utilities for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4083)|
| 1:08:09| It's not really costing the school system anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4089)|
| 1:08:14| Why would you say no to something that has been proven to be effective for our school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4094)|
| 1:08:20| What are you going to offer as a substitute of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4100)|
| 1:08:24| So we're not asking you to say if you want to bring your kids, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4104)|
| 1:08:28| If you have a problem with something, bring it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4108)|
| 1:08:31| And I'm sure Mr. Denise Dean will work with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4111)|
| 1:08:36| If you can't work with Mr. Denise Dean, you can't work with nobody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4116)|
| 1:08:42| She is a wonderful executive director who has worked to make this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4122)|
| 1:08:49| And we're not asking for a whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4129)|
| 1:08:52| We're just asking for your approval and something that we already have set up and going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4132)|
| 1:08:57| So take it away, but explain to us how we're going to do it otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4137)|
| 1:09:02| What are you going to give us in place of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4142)|
| 1:09:05| It's not costing us anything, but what we already spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4145)|
| 1:09:09| I could say more, but I'm going to stop right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4149)|
| 1:09:13| Mr. Watson, I'm going to ask a couple of questions if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4153)|
| 1:09:17| So Dr. Wilson, just to be clear, we're already providing bus service to these schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4157)|
| 1:09:25| because I assume that Knox County Schools already has summer programming in these schools, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4165)|
| 1:09:31| We do. We have 29 sites that we're going to be running our summer learning camps at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4171)|
| 1:09:34| Okay, and this is at three of those 29 sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4174)|
| 1:09:39| So this is not a replacement for our summer programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4179)|
| 1:09:45| No, it would expand opportunities for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4185)|
| 1:09:48| This is a choice. It's a choice that parents can make or not make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4188)|
| 1:09:55| Just like the charter school is a choice parents can make. Am I correct in saying that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4195)|
| 1:10:00| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4200)|
| 1:10:01| So that was my first question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4201)|
| 1:10:05| My second question is, I know we talk a lot about literacy and summer loss, and I'm curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4205)|
| 1:10:16| I know that this program has been running for a few years, and this might be a question for Ms. Dean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4216)|
| 1:10:22| but I believe there's some data that they've already collected surrounding their success of the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4222)|
| 1:10:31| Yeah, if you want specifics on data, I would definitely have to refer to Ms. Dean on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4231)|
| 1:10:36| But I know as part of their website, you share data sets based on past summers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4236)|
| 1:10:41| So Ms. Dean, could you share that? You can share it tonight or maybe just send it out to board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4241)|
| 1:10:47| if you want to send it in an e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4247)|
| 1:10:51| It might be good for people to – I mean, you can share it tonight, but I think when we all go home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4251)|
| 1:10:57| it might be good to just have that visual, be able to reflect on the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4257)|
| 1:11:02| Yeah, and the e-mail I would send would have three data points, but I'll just share two because it's really simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4262)|
| 1:11:07| So one is percent of scholars that improved or maintained their instructional reading level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4267)|
| 1:11:11| and the other one is parent satisfaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4271)|
| 1:11:13| So by year, in 2017, 84% of our scholars improved or maintained, 100% parent satisfaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4273)|
| 1:11:21| In 2018, 100% of our scholars improved or maintained, parent satisfaction 90%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4281)|
| 1:11:27| In 2019, 86% of our scholars improved or maintained – this is their instructional reading level –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4287)|
| 1:11:34| and 90% parent satisfaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4294)|
| 1:11:37| We didn't have data in 2020 because of COVID, but we put a lot of material online for our families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4297)|
| 1:11:44| and the children still got books each week for their home library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4304)|
| 1:11:48| In 2021, 79% of our scholars improved or maintained their instructional reading level, 100% parent satisfaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4308)|
| 1:11:55| And last summer, 84% of our scholars improved or maintained their instructional reading level, 100% parent satisfaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4315)|
| 1:12:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4323)|
| 1:12:04| If you could just send that to Ms. Coatney, she could forward it to board members if you don't mind doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4324)|
| 1:12:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4330)|
| 1:12:12| So, and Dr. Wilson, you said that the challenges would be the same policies we have in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4332)|
| 1:12:20| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4340)|
| 1:12:21| So, again, our administrative policy and procedure is written in language that feels very much like it's being facilitated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4341)|
| 1:12:27| through a school process and a principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4347)|
| 1:12:29| We would have to modify that a bit, but Dr. Phillips has already –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4349)|
| 1:12:32| I've already had a conversation with her about how we could address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4352)|
| 1:12:35| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4355)|
| 1:12:36| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4356)|
| 1:12:38| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4358)|
| 1:12:40| Ms. Dean, can I ask you one more question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4360)|
| 1:12:42| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4362)|
| 1:12:44| You sat all the way in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4364)|
| 1:12:50| I know most meetings I'm in with you, you sit toward the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4370)|
| 1:12:54| My question is in response to Mr. Triplett's concern in terms of –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4374)|
| 1:13:01| I know what the process is if somebody has a concern within Knox County Schools related to curriculum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4381)|
| 1:13:06| or books that kids might be accessing and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4386)|
| 1:13:09| but can you talk to us a little bit about your process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4389)|
| 1:13:13| If a parent had a legitimate concern –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4393)|
| 1:13:16| and from what I think I heard you say earlier is you've never had a concern brought up, but suppose you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4396)|
| 1:13:23| What I would imagine what we would do is they would not be in the classroom that morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4403)|
| 1:13:28| and they would be with our site coordinator and doing some reading of a different book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4408)|
| 1:13:33| So you would just provide a different opportunity for the particular child where the parent expressed concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4413)|
| 1:13:41| And then to Dr. Wilson's point, I want to make sure that I was hearing that correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4421)|
| 1:13:46| as a part of this particular program for this summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4426)|
| 1:13:49| and I don't know if this is something you've done every summer, if this is something that will be new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4429)|
| 1:13:53| you are providing a curriculum list and a resource list to parents ahead of time, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4433)|
| 1:13:58| Is that what I was hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4438)|
| 1:14:00| Is that the intent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4440)|
| 1:14:02| One of the things I can say is we have orientation before the Freedom School starts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4442)|
| 1:14:06| and we always give our parents book summaries of all the books that are going to be read that summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4446)|
| 1:14:12| So they're informed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4452)|
| 1:14:14| Okay. Thank you. I appreciate that, Ms. Dean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4454)|
| 1:14:17| I don't have much more to add, but I do think it's interesting that this conversation is coming up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4457)|
| 1:14:23| right on the heels of our charter school conversation and how many times we talked about –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4463)|
| 1:14:27| different members of the board talked about parent choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4467)|
| 1:14:31| I understand that everyone of us in this room had different levels of comfort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4471)|
| 1:14:36| related to educational materials, related to specific books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4476)|
| 1:14:40| I don't know the specific books that Freedom Schools uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4480)|
| 1:14:44| but I would expect that any parent that accesses it, like any other educational opportunity, would vet that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4484)|
| 1:14:52| And I don't know that we should be basing a decision on an MOU with Freedom Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4492)|
| 1:14:58| about blog posts from a national organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4498)|
| 1:15:02| In that I understand that there are legitimate concerns for some culturally, politically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4502)|
| 1:15:10| Obviously, that's been all throughout the news and political circles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4510)|
| 1:15:15| I totally get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4515)|
| 1:15:17| And I understand that for those folks, those concerns are extremely valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4517)|
| 1:15:21| And I have no doubt your concerns are extremely valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4521)|
| 1:15:25| My guess is if your kids were still of that age, I don't know that they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4525)|
| 1:15:29| you probably wouldn't be signing your kid up for Freedom Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4529)|
| 1:15:32| I would assume. I don't know that to be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4532)|
| 1:15:35| But I think it's important for us to understand, just like I tried to communicate the other night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4535)|
| 1:15:40| that we are all representing very different constituencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4540)|
| 1:15:44| and we need to be willing to hear from one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4544)|
| 1:15:46| And from what I understand from this MOU, we are providing –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4546)|
| 1:15:52| we are trying to make it more accessible for students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4552)|
| 1:15:55| in terms of limiting some of the barriers around transportation and things like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4555)|
| 1:16:00| But Ms. Denise Dean and her team are going to continue to run Freedom Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4560)|
| 1:16:05| like they have been running Freedom Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4565)|
| 1:16:07| And I think regardless of this MOU, kids would still have access to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4567)|
| 1:16:12| I think what this is, this is an opportunity for Knox County Schools to be a good community partner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4572)|
| 1:16:18| and make it easier for those kids who, frankly, tend to have transportation challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4578)|
| 1:16:23| when we're already running the buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4583)|
| 1:16:26| So I would implore us as a board, again, not to get sucked up into –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4586)|
| 1:16:34| I mean, I'm just going to call it what it is, culture wars, national politics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4594)|
| 1:16:39| around this very particular decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4599)|
| 1:16:42| Because like we already elevated around charter schools, parents do have a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4602)|
| 1:16:48| And Mr. Triplett, you are one of the people who are most vocal about parent choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4608)|
| 1:16:54| And, you know, again, I think Mr. Reverend Butler, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4614)|
| 1:17:01| obviously is speaking for his very specific community and the work that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4621)|
| 1:17:05| And I know Ms. Owen brought this up during the charter school conversation too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4625)|
| 1:17:09| I think it is important for us to hear from people in the communities that are impacted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4629)|
| 1:17:12| about the things that are being represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4632)|
| 1:17:15| And, you know, I don't know this to be true, but my guess is probably very few kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4635)|
| 1:17:21| from your particular community have ever gone to Freedom Schools for lots of different reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4641)|
| 1:17:26| But I don't think that should impact the accessibility of somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4646)|
| 1:17:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4650)|
| 1:17:32| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4652)|
| 1:17:33| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4653)|
| 1:17:35| Of course, you know, I've been very clear about my support for parental rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4655)|
| 1:17:39| so I do appreciate your comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4659)|
| 1:17:42| Dr. Wilson, I would like to better understand the difference between last year and this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4662)|
| 1:17:48| Because if so when we've had these Freedom Schools in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4668)|
| 1:17:55| basically it's been they've been leasing the space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4675)|
| 1:17:59| and it hasn't been endorsed by Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4679)|
| 1:18:02| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4682)|
| 1:18:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4685)|
| 1:18:06| So in the past we have allowed our schools to be used in the summer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4686)|
| 1:18:10| by East Tennessee Freedom Schools to run their summer programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4690)|
| 1:18:13| The agreement that you see before you has a new data sharing component to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4693)|
| 1:18:19| So it's a data sharing agreement between East Tennessee Freedom Schools and Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4699)|
| 1:18:24| which I presume has not existed before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4704)|
| 1:18:27| I'm new in this role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4707)|
| 1:18:28| I wasn't involved in that program last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4708)|
| 1:18:31| And then, again, a granting of when space and funding is available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4711)|
| 1:18:36| because this is an MOU that can be re-upped for several years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4716)|
| 1:18:40| when space and funding is available for transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4720)|
| 1:18:43| where we are running on-site summer learning camps in the same facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4723)|
| 1:18:48| that they're running their Freedom Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4728)|
| 1:18:50| that if we can accommodate that we would have transportation available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4730)|
| 1:18:54| for them to ride our buses that are already going to those locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4734)|
| 1:18:59| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4739)|
| 1:19:00| And, Mr. Dupler, I have a question regarding the fact that this can be extended for additional years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4740)|
| 1:19:10| So going back to my concern about the curriculum, some of the curriculum that is on the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4750)|
| 1:19:20| and I think Ms. Steen alluded to the fact that they do use the curriculum because it is a franchise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4760)|
| 1:19:26| So some of that curriculum is problematic because it's against state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4766)|
| 1:19:31| There are problems in the curriculum that KCS would not have some of those books| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4771)|
| 1:19:38| because there's some problems in that curriculum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4778)|
| 1:19:41| So let's say, and I appreciate that parents are going to get a copy of that curriculum ahead of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4781)|
| 1:19:47| I think that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4787)|
| 1:19:48| And parents then have the option to opt into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4788)|
| 1:19:52| If there is a concern with curriculum, then what happens when we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4792)|
| 1:19:58| this would not come back before the board since it's renewable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4798)|
| 1:20:02| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4802)|
| 1:20:03| So my question would be, let's say there is a problem with curriculum that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4803)|
| 1:20:09| this board is aware of curriculum that is taught that would fall under those concepts that are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4809)|
| 1:20:16| whether it's sexual content or the fact that the 1619 is not the curriculum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4816)|
| 1:20:22| that is taught by the state of Tennessee regarding history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4822)|
| 1:20:25| Would that play into the fact of that being renewable, that contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4825)|
| 1:20:31| Does my question make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4831)|
| 1:20:35| I think so, Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4835)|
| 1:20:36| I think what you're asking is, I mean, if the board approves this particular MOU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4836)|
| 1:20:42| it would be renewable, which for the four years after this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4842)|
| 1:20:49| that could happen just administratively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4849)|
| 1:20:52| But if the board, if any board member had a concern about the curriculum, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4852)|
| 1:20:59| in years following, i.e., the four years where there could be a renewal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4859)|
| 1:21:04| a board member could lift it up to the board for a full board review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4864)|
| 1:21:09| and possible, you know, action at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4869)|
| 1:21:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4873)|
| 1:21:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4874)|
| 1:21:17| Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4877)|
| 1:21:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4878)|
| 1:21:19| Just a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4879)|
| 1:21:20| If they are at schools that already have summer learning camps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4880)|
| 1:21:23| and there is no East Tennessee Freedom Schools in the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4883)|
| 1:21:26| can they go to those summer learning camps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4886)|
| 1:21:28| Is that an option for them to enroll in advance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4888)|
| 1:21:32| You're referencing the Knox County Schools providing one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4892)|
| 1:21:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4894)|
| 1:21:35| So, yes and no, because we are, our big lift this year, as everybody well knows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4895)|
| 1:21:40| is going to be meeting the ones that are required to attend for the rising fourth grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4900)|
| 1:21:45| And Ms. Thompson has been working diligently to ensure that we've got enough staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4905)|
| 1:21:49| to cover that requirement first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4909)|
| 1:21:51| And so we do have limited capacity from Knox County Schools' side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4911)|
| 1:21:55| to offer seats for our first graders, our second graders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4915)|
| 1:21:59| We are accommodating all the requests right now that we're getting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4919)|
| 1:22:03| hopefully, for our third and fifth graders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4923)|
| 1:22:05| and then we certainly have to for our fourth graders because of the requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4925)|
| 1:22:08| So I can say that maybe it would depend on site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4928)|
| 1:22:12| and it would depend on how many teachers we actually end up having available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4932)|
| 1:22:15| because our first priority is to meet the needs of that fourth grade class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4935)|
| 1:22:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4940)|
| 1:22:23| To your comment about parent choice, Mr. Watson, I do appreciate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4943)|
| 1:22:28| and I am a fan of parent choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4948)|
| 1:22:31| I'm a fan of parents having a choice in education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4951)|
| 1:22:34| which is one of the main reasons I voted for the charter school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4954)|
| 1:22:39| But to me, this kind of organization and their agenda seems to go beyond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4959)|
| 1:22:45| just simply education to some sort of, and I don't know what other term to use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4965)|
| 1:22:50| but indoctrination of certain ideology that I can't support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4970)|
| 1:22:57| And I know you talk about a kind of culture war, and politically, to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4977)|
| 1:23:02| it's not really about, I'm not even sure what a culture war is per se| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4982)|
| 1:23:07| or a political agenda in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4987)|
| 1:23:10| Really, to me, it's just a matter of personal conviction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4990)|
| 1:23:13| It is what I firmly believe the Bible teaches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4993)|
| 1:23:18| and I firmly believe these topics should not be discussed with young people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=4998)|
| 1:23:25| So it isn't really for me at all about kind of hot button issues in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5005)|
| 1:23:30| It's really just personally a matter of conviction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5010)|
| 1:23:33| And I can appreciate being willing to give and take with other members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5013)|
| 1:23:38| I understand the concern there and wanting to provide that resource for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5018)|
| 1:23:44| And I can appreciate that, Mr. Butler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5024)|
| 1:23:46| desiring having that option for students to have a meal and a good program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5026)|
| 1:23:53| and reading and improve literacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5033)|
| 1:23:55| And I think all of those are great goals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5035)|
| 1:23:58| but I cannot support those with the addition of this type of material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5038)|
| 1:24:04| So ultimately, in the end, it's not a matter of anything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5044)|
| 1:24:08| but it's just a personal conviction that I have that I can't vote for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5048)|
| 1:24:14| Ms. Ellen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5054)|
| 1:24:16| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5056)|
| 1:24:17| I have a question for Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5057)|
| 1:24:20| Do we have the ability to deny a community group access to a school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5060)|
| 1:24:26| based on the materials they choose to use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5066)|
| 1:24:40| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5080)|
| 1:24:43| Schools have a duty to remain neutral, whether it's political or religious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5083)|
| 1:24:51| So I believe what you're asking is if a community user wants to come in and use a facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5091)|
| 1:25:00| it has to be on a neutral basis, which are we applying it to this situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5100)|
| 1:25:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5107)|
| 1:25:09| This MOU, as has been discussed, is asking for more than just facility use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5109)|
| 1:25:16| So if it were just facility use, it wouldn't even need to be before this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5116)|
| 1:25:23| So that would be my response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5123)|
| 1:25:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5125)|
| 1:25:26| So they could still use our facilities if we did not approve this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5126)|
| 1:25:31| if we choose not to approve this agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5131)|
| 1:25:35| They could still use our facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5135)|
| 1:25:37| They could still have their program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5137)|
| 1:25:39| They could still do everything they've been doing for the last seven years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5139)|
| 1:25:42| and we could not say no, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5142)|
| 1:25:52| So I would say yes with the caveat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5152)|
| 1:25:57| and the caveat is no matter what group is using a facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5157)|
| 1:26:05| that group still has to follow state and federal law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5165)|
| 1:26:09| So that could be an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5169)|
| 1:26:12| And again, I'm not saying that that is an issue in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5172)|
| 1:26:15| but I'm saying that you're asking me a very general question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5175)|
| 1:26:19| and I'm giving you a general answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5179)|
| 1:26:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5181)|
| 1:26:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5182)|
| 1:26:23| So we are not considering approving the program at all is my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5183)|
| 1:26:29| What we are looking at has nothing to do with approving the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5189)|
| 1:26:33| The only thing we are approving is bus use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5193)|
| 1:26:36| and data sharing to see how well their program is working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5196)|
| 1:26:44| I mean, you're approving the MOU that's before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5204)|
| 1:26:47| which, I mean, includes that, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5207)|
| 1:26:51| the MOU has various aspects to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5211)|
| 1:26:57| But I think Dr. Wilson has accurately described that that's the big difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5217)|
| 1:27:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5222)|
| 1:27:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5223)|
| 1:27:05| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5225)|
| 1:27:07| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5227)|
| 1:27:08| Ms. Dean, I have one more question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5228)|
| 1:27:10| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5230)|
| 1:27:11| I really do promise this is the last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5231)|
| 1:27:13| And if you don't have access to this information tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5233)|
| 1:27:16| I'd like to, if you could submit it to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5236)|
| 1:27:20| Can you tell us about the socioeconomic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5240)|
| 1:27:25| and racial demographics of the students in Freedom Schools roughly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5245)|
| 1:27:29| Yeah, about 80 percent of our scholars are black| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5249)|
| 1:27:34| and 80 to 90 percent are eligible for free or reduced lunch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5254)|
| 1:27:38| something in that range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5258)|
| 1:27:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5260)|
| 1:27:41| And, again, I'm not trying to speak to any one specific book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5261)|
| 1:27:44| I don't think we should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5264)|
| 1:27:45| I mean, I don't make decisions based on one book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5265)|
| 1:27:49| But in terms of the curriculum as a whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5269)|
| 1:27:52| is the intent of Freedom Schools to leverage a curriculum that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5272)|
| 1:27:58| in the view of Freedom Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5278)|
| 1:27:59| is more culturally accessible to the specific demographic that it serves?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5279)|
| 1:28:04| Yeah, we talk about our books in two ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5284)|
| 1:28:06| Some of you may have heard this before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5286)|
| 1:28:07| but we talk about them as mirrors and windows, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5287)|
| 1:28:10| So we want to have text that children reading them can see themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5290)|
| 1:28:14| or people that look like they're family members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5294)|
| 1:28:16| or hear stories that are familiar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5296)|
| 1:28:18| Those are the mirrors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5298)|
| 1:28:19| And then the windows, right, give children a view into other cultures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5299)|
| 1:28:24| other lifestyles, other places, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5304)|
| 1:28:28| And that's part of it is our empathy, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5308)|
| 1:28:31| trying to cultivate more empathy and understanding about people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5311)|
| 1:28:34| who are different from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5314)|
| 1:28:35| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5315)|
| 1:28:36| In your opinion, is that some of the strength and benefit of Freedom Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5316)|
| 1:28:40| and why it's able to get the results that it does on the literacy side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5320)|
| 1:28:45| that the curriculum feels more accessible to those students that are engaging in it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5325)|
| 1:28:50| I think that helps a whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5330)|
| 1:28:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5331)|
| 1:28:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5332)|
| 1:28:53| I think that's an important point in that where I might access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5333)|
| 1:28:57| that particular curriculum, given my background and my upbringing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5337)|
| 1:29:01| and my socioeconomics and even my race,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5341)|
| 1:29:05| it may not speak to me as much as somebody else who's accessing that curriculum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5345)|
| 1:29:11| And I think that's an important point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5351)|
| 1:29:13| And I think regardless of what happens with this particular vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5353)|
| 1:29:16| I mean, I think that's something everybody who's in education needs to be conscious of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5356)|
| 1:29:20| that the materials and the curriculum that we are putting before students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5360)|
| 1:29:23| are accessible to those students in ways that keep them engaged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5363)|
| 1:29:27| and interested in the mirrors and windows and that they see themselves in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5367)|
| 1:29:30| So thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5370)|
| 1:29:33| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5373)|
| 1:29:36| Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5376)|
| 1:29:37| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5377)|
| 1:29:38| Ms. Owen, going back to your question about facility use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5378)|
| 1:29:41| if this were simply a facility use question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5381)|
| 1:29:45| I think that different organizations of any type can use our facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5385)|
| 1:29:51| and it's not even an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5391)|
| 1:29:53| I don't think that any of us would question that because various groups use our facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5393)|
| 1:29:57| on a daily, weekly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5397)|
| 1:30:00| So to me that's not a question at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5400)|
| 1:30:02| I think when we enter into an MOU that that's where it becomes a partnership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5402)|
| 1:30:07| and so we have more of a responsibility to ask questions on the content.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5407)|
| 1:30:13| So I just wanted to make that point, that to me that is where we have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5413)|
| 1:30:18| it's incumbent upon us to ask the questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5418)|
| 1:30:21| because we know that KCS is held by certain state standards on curriculum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5421)|
| 1:30:28| or standards, of course, we choose the curriculum that fits into those standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5428)|
| 1:30:34| So I think we do have to ask questions about the curriculum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5434)|
| 1:30:39| I'm just troubled by the fact that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5439)|
| 1:30:44| in a quick overview of some of the curriculums that are possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5444)|
| 1:30:47| that there are some problematic texts that could be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5447)|
| 1:30:51| So anyway, that's what I'm struggling with here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5451)|
| 1:30:59| Ms. Spike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5459)|
| 1:31:00| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5460)|
| 1:31:01| Is there anyone that could speak to the value of the data that we would get from this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5461)|
| 1:31:08| As I understand, that's a part of it, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5468)|
| 1:31:16| Dr. Wilson, is that, would that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5476)|
| 1:31:20| I'm trying to move to that section of the agreement, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5480)|
| 1:31:24| It seems as if the data that we would be sharing with Freedom Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5484)|
| 1:31:31| Freedom Schools would be tied back into, again, that reading performance data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5491)|
| 1:31:36| So the assessments that we use in the spring window,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5496)|
| 1:31:39| actually three times a year we're using the spring window and the fall window,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5499)|
| 1:31:41| are the Aimsweb assessments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5501)|
| 1:31:42| which actually dig into more specific skill sets within the student reading profile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5502)|
| 1:31:46| And so the data we would be sharing with them for students that are participating in their program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5506)|
| 1:31:50| would be that kind of ending spring data for the year prior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5510)|
| 1:31:54| and the first data of the fall window the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5514)|
| 1:31:57| So that would be the assessment of, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5517)|
| 1:32:00| what the summer impact of that learning loss or capturing that learning loss would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5520)|
| 1:32:05| So would this be just us sharing data or are we also getting data?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5525)|
| 1:32:10| We jointly agree to share data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5530)|
| 1:32:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5533)|
| 1:32:16| It's NC and the joint section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5536)|
| 1:32:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5539)|
| 1:32:23| I think I'm getting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5543)|
| 1:32:31| We jointly agree to share data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5551)|
| 1:32:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5556)|
| 1:32:38| It's NC and the joint section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5558)|
| 1:32:43| So if we were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5563)|
| 1:32:45| is there a plan to get the data from them that would help Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5565)|
| 1:32:50| to better assist these kids in the continuing year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5570)|
| 1:32:58| Again, the assessment data we would be relying on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5578)|
| 1:33:00| we would collect already for our purposes through the Aimsweb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5580)|
| 1:33:04| So we wouldn't be getting anything extra?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5584)|
| 1:33:07| To what I've seen in this agreement, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5587)|
| 1:33:10| Do you see additional data?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5590)|
| 1:33:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5592)|
| 1:33:13| Is that to maybe help them judge the success of their program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5593)|
| 1:33:16| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5596)|
| 1:33:18| And I would also add,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5598)|
| 1:33:20| I think the additional data we may be able to glean from this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5600)|
| 1:33:23| is the impact of the program ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5603)|
| 1:33:25| So we would be looking at the same data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5605)|
| 1:33:27| but that is not something that we could personally speak to at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5607)|
| 1:33:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5610)|
| 1:33:31| In the past, is there anything, have we shared data?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5611)|
| 1:33:37| Again, I haven't been affiliated with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5617)|
| 1:33:39| That would be a better question for probably our RA department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5619)|
| 1:33:41| but we could find that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5621)|
| 1:33:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5623)|
| 1:33:44| Yeah, I think it would be really helpful for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5624)|
| 1:33:45| if we could get that information before Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5625)|
| 1:33:52| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5632)|
| 1:33:54| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5634)|
| 1:33:55| I just want to clarify the purpose of the questions I asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5635)|
| 1:33:58| The reason I asked was because there seemed to be confusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5638)|
| 1:34:02| over what we were approving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5642)|
| 1:34:04| and I want to be sure everyone understands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5644)|
| 1:34:06| that we're not approving the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5646)|
| 1:34:08| We are only approving access to the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5648)|
| 1:34:12| which is something that is in our mission statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5652)|
| 1:34:17| and approving the data sharing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5657)|
| 1:34:20| so that it can be determined how successful the program is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5660)|
| 1:34:26| And as far as using it for our own data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5666)|
| 1:34:29| I think having that information to compare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5669)|
| 1:34:32| with other summer learning programs might be useful to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5672)|
| 1:34:38| even if we don't currently have a plan to use that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5678)|
| 1:34:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5681)|
| 1:34:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5686)|
| 1:34:48| Anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5688)|
| 1:34:49| Reverend Butler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5689)|
| 1:34:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5690)|
| 1:34:55| Struggling with this, quite honestly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5695)|
| 1:34:58| But I do see on page four of the agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5698)|
| 1:35:14| number four says compliance with laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5714)|
| 1:35:19| ETFS agrees to comply with any and all applicable federal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5719)|
| 1:35:23| state, and local laws and regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5723)|
| 1:35:28| So if there's anything that they were to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5728)|
| 1:35:33| that violated state law, they would have to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5733)|
| 1:35:41| It's in the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5741)|
| 1:35:42| They can't break state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5742)|
| 1:35:44| So anything that you've got a problem with state law-wise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5744)|
| 1:35:48| they can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5748)|
| 1:35:50| So the other thing is that there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5750)|
| 1:36:04| times when I hear things from the people in my community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5764)|
| 1:36:12| that I personally may not agree with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5772)|
| 1:36:16| but I was elected by those folk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5776)|
| 1:36:20| And so that is what, as long as it's legal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5780)|
| 1:36:27| that's what we've got to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5787)|
| 1:36:28| We've got to follow state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5788)|
| 1:36:30| We've got to follow state regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5790)|
| 1:36:33| So I think, once again, I would say that this MOU is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5793)|
| 1:36:40| that we can and should vote for because this community needs it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5800)|
| 1:36:46| It has been a blessing or benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5806)|
| 1:36:48| I should probably say in this setting, for this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5808)|
| 1:36:52| So I know there's a lot of reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5812)|
| 1:36:54| that one might want to find a vote against it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5814)|
| 1:36:57| but I really, quite honestly, say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5817)|
| 1:37:00| that if we're in the business of educating kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5820)|
| 1:37:03| this memorandum agreement has what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5823)|
| 1:37:06| in it to make sure that they're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5826)|
| 1:37:09| to do what they need to do to comply with whatever Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5829)|
| 1:37:13| County needs them to comply with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5833)|
| 1:37:20| And also, once again, parents are not just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5840)|
| 1:37:25| saying we want the program, but it was just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5845)|
| 1:37:29| an elementary program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5849)|
| 1:37:30| It's been extended to a middle school program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5850)|
| 1:37:33| because of the need for the program in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5853)|
| 1:37:37| and because of the parents' appreciation for the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5857)|
| 1:37:45| So what I'm fighting for right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5865)|
| 1:37:51| is our community, this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5871)|
| 1:37:55| These programs, once again, it's not just supported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5875)|
| 1:37:59| by Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5879)|
| 1:38:01| And I go out on a limb and say if Knox County schools said no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5881)|
| 1:38:05| Freedom Schools would still find a way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5885)|
| 1:38:07| Because dead gummit, we've always had to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5887)|
| 1:38:11| This is not new for us to have someone say no to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5891)|
| 1:38:14| that you should be saying yes to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5894)|
| 1:38:16| It's not new for your personal opinions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5896)|
| 1:38:18| to be applied to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5898)|
| 1:38:20| That's not new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5900)|
| 1:38:22| It ain't about racism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5902)|
| 1:38:24| It's about having someone have power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5904)|
| 1:38:28| over what your community or what you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5908)|
| 1:38:30| think your community can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5910)|
| 1:38:33| So this organization has reached out and said, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5913)|
| 1:38:37| let us work with the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5917)|
| 1:38:41| And haven't asked for anything extravagant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5921)|
| 1:38:45| just simple things, to work with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5925)|
| 1:38:49| And you're saying, no, we don't want to work with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5929)|
| 1:38:51| because of the book you read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5931)|
| 1:38:53| Well, I can tell you the person, and you tell me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5933)|
| 1:38:57| if I'm wrong, Ms. Dean, but the person who's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5937)|
| 1:39:00| in charge of running the Green School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5940)|
| 1:39:04| is a member of the church I pastor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5944)|
| 1:39:09| She's been our music director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5949)|
| 1:39:12| So if she reads a book and she says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5952)|
| 1:39:14| oh, I don't know about this, she's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5954)|
| 1:39:16| going to read it by Ms. Dean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5956)|
| 1:39:18| And they're going to look at it to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5958)|
| 1:39:20| that this is something that she wants her child to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5960)|
| 1:39:24| So this is not something that you're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5964)|
| 1:39:26| oh, I don't like this book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5966)|
| 1:39:27| I don't want to read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5967)|
| 1:39:28| Well, if they don't like the book,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5968)|
| 1:39:30| they're not going to read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5970)|
| 1:39:32| We're not stupid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5972)|
| 1:39:35| We're not ignorant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5975)|
| 1:39:37| We know how to take care of our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5977)|
| 1:39:39| And so the bottom line is that, to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5979)|
| 1:39:42| it's a slap in the face to take what a national organization is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5982)|
| 1:39:46| doing and apply it to what these three schools are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5986)|
| 1:39:49| doing in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5989)|
| 1:39:53| So I'm saying I'm having a tough time with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5993)|
| 1:39:56| because I hear what you're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5996)|
| 1:39:58| but it just don't calculate in my mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=5998)|
| 1:40:02| that what I know about Freedom Schools for the last seven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6002)|
| 1:40:05| years and how it has blessed our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6005)|
| 1:40:07| and benefited our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6007)|
| 1:40:09| And it hasn't been affected by any of those books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6009)|
| 1:40:12| None of those issues come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6012)|
| 1:40:15| Those are not issues for us at that Freedom School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6015)|
| 1:40:19| We even had a Freedom School across from our church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6019)|
| 1:40:21| which was main.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6021)|
| 1:40:22| We had volunteers at that school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6022)|
| 1:40:25| So this is supported by the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6025)|
| 1:40:28| So you're not just saying no to Children's Defense Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6028)|
| 1:40:32| You're saying no to East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6032)|
| 1:40:36| And we have a lot of community support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6036)|
| 1:40:38| a lot of focal feeders, and all they ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6038)|
| 1:40:40| was the school system help out by sharing some data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6040)|
| 1:40:43| and letting kids ride a bus that's already running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6043)|
| 1:40:46| That's all they've asked for additionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6046)|
| 1:40:49| So once again, I would be ashamed if this board said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6049)|
| 1:40:56| Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6056)|
| 1:40:57| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6057)|
| 1:41:00| Reverend Butler, I appreciate that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6060)|
| 1:41:02| know the people that are working here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6062)|
| 1:41:05| I absolutely appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6065)|
| 1:41:08| Going back to what I referenced about the 1619 project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6068)|
| 1:41:13| that concept is not against state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6073)|
| 1:41:16| So that wouldn't apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6076)|
| 1:41:17| Like number four wouldn't apply in that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6077)|
| 1:41:20| However, the fact that this organization has that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6080)|
| 1:41:27| on the reading list, if that was taught in the summer program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6087)|
| 1:41:34| and then the kids come to school and they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6094)|
| 1:41:36| hearing different history, that could create issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6096)|
| 1:41:39| for the kids because then they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6099)|
| 1:41:41| hearing different history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6101)|
| 1:41:46| So I think that's kind of my concern because the curriculum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6106)|
| 1:41:54| it's not against state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6114)|
| 1:41:56| So it wouldn't go against that contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6116)|
| 1:41:59| Respectfully, Ms. Horn, that's already happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6119)|
| 1:42:05| That's already happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6125)|
| 1:42:08| If we talk about Thanksgiving, talk about Columbus Day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6128)|
| 1:42:14| and I can go down the list of history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6134)|
| 1:42:18| how it's being reported by one segment of population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6138)|
| 1:42:22| and how it's being reported by another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6142)|
| 1:42:25| Talk to a Native American.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6145)|
| 1:42:27| They may not see American history the same way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6147)|
| 1:42:29| a European American might see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6149)|
| 1:42:33| It's who's telling the story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6153)|
| 1:42:35| So that's already happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6155)|
| 1:42:36| One of the reasons why we're where we are right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6156)|
| 1:42:39| is because we don't want to explore what the truth is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6159)|
| 1:42:43| When you have different stories being told,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6163)|
| 1:42:45| let's sit down and talk and see what's the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6165)|
| 1:42:47| You may find out that neither one of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6167)|
| 1:42:49| is purely the whole truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6169)|
| 1:42:51| But that's part of the processes of thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6171)|
| 1:42:54| and exploring, educating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6174)|
| 1:42:55| So it's already happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6175)|
| 1:42:58| There's a great deal of people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6178)|
| 1:43:00| don't agree that there's something wrong with 1619.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6180)|
| 1:43:03| It's a book that somebody wrote from their perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6183)|
| 1:43:08| You read it, there's some things that will be true in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6188)|
| 1:43:11| and things that are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6191)|
| 1:43:12| And that's been true by every book| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6192)|
| 1:43:14| I've read to get my BA, my BS, my master's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6194)|
| 1:43:22| and my doctorate of ministry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6202)|
| 1:43:24| Every one of them had stuff in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6204)|
| 1:43:26| that I agreed with and didn't agree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6206)|
| 1:43:28| That's part of the process of learning and thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6208)|
| 1:43:31| So I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6211)|
| 1:43:33| There's going to be some books on that list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6213)|
| 1:43:35| you might not like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6215)|
| 1:43:36| There are some books on that list I may not like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6216)|
| 1:43:38| But at the end of the day, what the teachers are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6218)|
| 1:43:41| to do is teach kids how to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6221)|
| 1:43:44| They're not indoctrinating anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6224)|
| 1:43:48| People are not indoctrinated by reading those books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6228)|
| 1:43:51| People are socialized by their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6231)|
| 1:43:57| If your kids think about something more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6237)|
| 1:43:59| about a book they read than what you're saying at home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6239)|
| 1:44:02| then there may be something wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6242)|
| 1:44:04| So the bottom line is that I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6244)|
| 1:44:06| that we're using this piece of information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6246)|
| 1:44:10| to push back against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6250)|
| 1:44:12| And I think it's unfair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6252)|
| 1:44:14| It's unfair to evaluate this freedom school that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6254)|
| 1:44:17| been providing this service for this long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6257)|
| 1:44:19| It's unfair to evaluate them by that book list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6259)|
| 1:44:24| Because number one, they didn't make up the book list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6264)|
| 1:44:27| And number two, I know what they do on the ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6267)|
| 1:44:29| every week, every summer that I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6269)|
| 1:44:34| been involved with freedom schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6274)|
| 1:44:37| that they teach kids how to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6277)|
| 1:44:40| They help teach kids how to act in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6280)|
| 1:44:44| They help kids stay involved in something positive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6284)|
| 1:44:47| during the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6287)|
| 1:44:49| And they give these kids something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6289)|
| 1:44:51| that the Knox County school system can't give them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6291)|
| 1:44:55| Because you have people involved that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6295)|
| 1:44:57| are not involved in Knox County school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6297)|
| 1:44:59| system from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6299)|
| 1:45:01| This is a place, we talk about getting community involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6301)|
| 1:45:04| Community is already involved with freedom school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6304)|
| 1:45:07| And then you're going to yank it away just because of a book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6307)|
| 1:45:11| That book is not going to make as much difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6311)|
| 1:45:13| as it would not having this program because of that book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6313)|
| 1:45:16| That's where the difference is going to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6316)|
| 1:45:19| That's what, if you really want to think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6319)|
| 1:45:21| what black folks feel, black folk don't feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6321)|
| 1:45:23| about what they read in the book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6323)|
| 1:45:25| Black folks feel about what you do to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6325)|
| 1:45:28| And that's real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6328)|
| 1:45:29| We want real talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6329)|
| 1:45:30| Real talk is that book don't really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6330)|
| 1:45:33| matter to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6333)|
| 1:45:34| It's just a book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6334)|
| 1:45:36| We live in life right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6336)|
| 1:45:37| And right now we're saying, hey, we want to have a program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6337)|
| 1:45:40| that we've been having, we've been paying for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6340)|
| 1:45:42| we've been supporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6342)|
| 1:45:43| And all we want for you is to let us have data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6343)|
| 1:45:46| so we can make sure that we're meeting the kids' needs better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6346)|
| 1:45:49| than we think we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6349)|
| 1:45:51| And number two is that we just want to ride on the bus you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6351)|
| 1:45:54| already running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6354)|
| 1:45:55| That's all we want from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6355)|
| 1:45:56| But you want to argue about a book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6356)|
| 1:45:58| OK, go ahead and vote against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6358)|
| 1:46:00| Well, you won't have the community support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6360)|
| 1:46:02| that we're trying to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6362)|
| 1:46:06| Because one of the most frustrating things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6366)|
| 1:46:09| is to try to work with somebody that when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6369)|
| 1:46:12| you ask them for something, a little bit of something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6372)|
| 1:46:15| they push back at you over something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6375)|
| 1:46:17| I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6377)|
| 1:46:19| I don't disagree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6379)|
| 1:46:20| There are some ministers on our board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6380)|
| 1:46:23| that are not reliant and say, hold it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6383)|
| 1:46:25| I may have a problem with that book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6385)|
| 1:46:27| And they go and talk with Ms. Dean about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6387)|
| 1:46:29| Am I right about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6389)|
| 1:46:32| And we deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6392)|
| 1:46:34| So no, we're not morally corrupt that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6394)|
| 1:46:37| don't care about what's in the book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6397)|
| 1:46:39| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6399)|
| 1:46:40| But we don't handle it by not offering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6400)|
| 1:46:42| the support that's needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6402)|
| 1:46:44| You said, tell us what you need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6404)|
| 1:46:47| We tell you what we need, and then all of a sudden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6407)|
| 1:46:49| we've got to fight over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6409)|
| 1:46:51| And I'm going to tell you what, what you're providing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6411)|
| 1:46:53| ain't worth that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6413)|
| 1:46:55| It is not worth that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6415)|
| 1:46:57| The reason why I'm passionately arguing about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6417)|
| 1:47:00| is because I know the community needs it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6420)|
| 1:47:04| But we can just say, go ahead and make your vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6424)|
| 1:47:07| We'll make it work the way we need to make it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6427)|
| 1:47:09| But we ain't going to ask you for nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6429)|
| 1:47:11| and don't ask us for nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6431)|
| 1:47:14| Because that's what I'm feeling here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6434)|
| 1:47:17| that when you need something on your side of town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6437)|
| 1:47:19| you get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6439)|
| 1:47:21| When we need something on our side of town, we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6441)|
| 1:47:26| And I want to work with everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6446)|
| 1:47:28| But if you're not going to work with me, daggone it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6448)|
| 1:47:30| what makes me think I want to work with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6450)|
| 1:47:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6463)|
| 1:47:44| So is there any more discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6464)|
| 1:47:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6469)|
| 1:47:50| Ms. Dean, thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6470)|
| 1:47:52| And if you don't mind sharing that, I've seen it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6472)|
| 1:47:55| but I don't know if everyone else has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6475)|
| 1:47:58| And I mean, there are some impressive statistics there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6478)|
| 1:48:04| So that would be great if you could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6484)|
| 1:48:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6492)|
| 1:48:13| So moving on to agenda item 11, 12 or 13, 14 or 15,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6493)|
| 1:48:37| 16 or 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6517)|
| 1:48:44| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6524)|
| 1:48:45| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6525)|
| 1:48:46| I just have a question about this whole bunch of these for Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6526)|
| 1:48:50| Is it possible for us to have some kind of contract in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6530)|
| 1:48:54| with Music Theater International| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6534)|
| 1:48:56| so that we don't have to approve every single one of these every year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6536)|
| 1:49:01| Ms. Owen, we've tried that, and they've said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6541)|
| 1:49:05| Awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6545)|
| 1:49:07| This is what we fondly called the Disney section of the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6547)|
| 1:49:12| in the agenda set meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6552)|
| 1:49:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6557)|
| 1:49:18| So I think we were on 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6558)|
| 1:49:23| Items 19 or 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6563)|
| 1:49:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6568)|
| 1:49:29| Going on to board policies, item 8A or B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6569)|
| 1:49:37| C or D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6577)|
| 1:49:42| E or F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6582)|
| 1:49:47| G or H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6587)|
| 1:49:52| I or J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6592)|
| 1:49:56| K or L.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6596)|
| 1:50:01| M.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6601)|
| 1:50:03| And item N, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6603)|
| 1:50:07| Is this the one we discussed needing approval on first reading possibly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6607)|
| 1:50:12| Would you like to speak to that or Dr. Wilson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6612)|
| 1:50:15| Go ahead, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6615)|
| 1:50:18| Because I haven't had enough time to talk tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6618)|
| 1:50:20| No, just kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6620)|
| 1:50:21| So, yes, the summer school attendance policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6621)|
| 1:50:23| This actually is a policy that we put on maybe a month or two ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6623)|
| 1:50:27| and we've been trying to be ahead of the eight ball with all things summer learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6627)|
| 1:50:31| and the penalty we pay for that is that the state provided additional guidance on the policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6631)|
| 1:50:36| and what needed to be in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6636)|
| 1:50:38| So we do, obviously, with summer learning starting in June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6638)|
| 1:50:41| it would be ideal to have the policy in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6641)|
| 1:50:44| The additional language really just does some clarification around attendance days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6644)|
| 1:50:48| and makeup days, the documentation that would be required and that we're calling out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6648)|
| 1:50:53| We will have a procedure for communicating with families around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6653)|
| 1:50:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6656)|
| 1:50:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6657)|
| 1:50:59| So moving into grants, item A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6659)|
| 1:51:06| Items B or C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6666)|
| 1:51:12| D or E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6672)|
| 1:51:16| F or G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6676)|
| 1:51:21| H or I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6681)|
| 1:51:23| Contracts 10A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6683)|
| 1:51:30| Ms. Bynum, you had mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6690)|
| 1:51:32| is this the one that you had mentioned that something came through earlier in the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6692)|
| 1:51:40| Oh, that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6700)|
| 1:51:44| Someone's doing accounting software.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6704)|
| 1:51:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6706)|
| 1:51:47| Oh, that was a different one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6707)|
| 1:51:49| I did say 10A, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6709)|
| 1:51:51| You're correct in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6711)|
| 1:51:52| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6712)|
| 1:51:53| You did not know, because it looks like I have 10A written down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6713)|
| 1:51:59| Is this the one, the same one that we had discussion on a few months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6719)|
| 1:52:04| and kind of brought some other stuff up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6724)|
| 1:52:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6727)|
| 1:52:09| And Mr. Dupler might be able to speak to that one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6729)|
| 1:52:13| but this actually, we had a discussion on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6733)|
| 1:52:15| And the agenda set meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6735)|
| 1:52:17| because there seemed to be some mixed feelings on the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6737)|
| 1:52:20| when we talked about it in policy review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6740)|
| 1:52:22| It is suspended for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6742)|
| 1:52:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6744)|
| 1:52:25| So it won't be happening this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6745)|
| 1:52:27| But in order for it, correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. Dupler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6747)|
| 1:52:31| for it not to have to go back through procurement and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6751)|
| 1:52:35| for future years or whatever the term of it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6755)|
| 1:52:39| we would need to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6759)|
| 1:52:40| take action on it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6760)|
| 1:52:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6762)|
| 1:52:43| That's why it's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6763)|
| 1:52:45| Is that correct, Mr. Dupler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6765)|
| 1:52:47| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6767)|
| 1:52:49| There's already been discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6769)|
| 1:52:51| And the issue is, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6771)|
| 1:52:55| it was difficult to secure this vendor through procurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6775)|
| 1:52:59| So, but if the board votes for this particular item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6779)|
| 1:53:03| we would need to take action on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6783)|
| 1:53:05| So, but if the board votes for this particular item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6785)|
| 1:53:10| this vendor would not be able to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6790)|
| 1:53:13| to collect for any overages or due balances this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6793)|
| 1:53:18| this school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6798)|
| 1:53:20| And then what would have to happen is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6800)|
| 1:53:23| for this vendor to actually be able to start collections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6803)|
| 1:53:27| next school year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6807)|
| 1:53:29| the contract would need to be renewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6809)|
| 1:53:32| But if the board votes this down now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6812)|
| 1:53:36| then it would have to be a completely new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6816)|
| 1:53:39| procurement process in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6819)|
| 1:53:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6821)|
| 1:53:43| And is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6823)|
| 1:53:45| if this moves forward and does not get voted down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6825)|
| 1:53:49| is this something where Brett Foster would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6829)|
| 1:53:53| she would turn people to this collection agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6833)|
| 1:53:57| or would they just know everyone that was in default?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6837)|
| 1:54:01| And move forward that way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6841)|
| 1:54:04| Ms. Foster, do you want to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6844)|
| 1:54:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6855)|
| 1:54:17| Thank you, Madam Chair, Ms. Bach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6857)|
| 1:54:19| The process in the past has been that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6859)|
| 1:54:22| we also have a procedure that goes along with this policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6862)|
| 1:54:25| for us to determine which accounts to send| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6865)|
| 1:54:27| to the collections agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6867)|
| 1:54:29| So the process in the past has been that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6869)|
| 1:54:31| we have someone in the school nutrition department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6871)|
| 1:54:33| who works specifically in IT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6873)|
| 1:54:35| And so we get that data together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6875)|
| 1:54:38| and submit that to this company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6878)|
| 1:54:41| So when you do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6881)|
| 1:54:44| so you're not necessarily sending every single one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6884)|
| 1:54:47| like if there's a $20 default or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6887)|
| 1:54:50| or if there is a family that is in need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6890)|
| 1:54:53| that might need to apply for free or reduced lunch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6893)|
| 1:54:57| you're still working with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6897)|
| 1:54:59| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6899)|
| 1:55:01| The procedure is written right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6901)|
| 1:55:03| The policy references that the superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6903)|
| 1:55:05| will set the procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6905)|
| 1:55:07| The procedure that we've worked off of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6907)|
| 1:55:09| ever since we started doing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6909)|
| 1:55:11| is a cumulative family debt of $25 or greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6911)|
| 1:55:15| So that's one of the things that we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6915)|
| 1:55:17| when we look at the data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6917)|
| 1:55:19| is consolidate that into family debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6919)|
| 1:55:21| as opposed to individual debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6921)|
| 1:55:23| We take out anyone that had qualified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6923)|
| 1:55:25| for free or reduced price meals during the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6925)|
| 1:55:28| There's a couple other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6928)|
| 1:55:29| but there's a procedure set of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6929)|
| 1:55:31| what things we take out of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6931)|
| 1:55:33| before submission to the company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6933)|
| 1:55:35| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6935)|
| 1:55:37| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6937)|
| 1:55:39| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6939)|
| 1:55:41| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6941)|
| 1:55:43| I was not able to come to policy review in March| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6943)|
| 1:55:45| because our groundbreaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6945)|
| 1:55:47| for the Early Education Center we started got moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6947)|
| 1:55:50| So I didn't get to hear the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6950)|
| 1:55:52| I know it was being brought up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6952)|
| 1:55:54| Can somebody summarize that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6954)|
| 1:55:56| Because I know the intent was to review the policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6956)|
| 1:55:57| that's impacted by this contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6957)|
| 1:55:59| or that impacts this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6959)|
| 1:56:01| But I know there was some conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6961)|
| 1:56:03| about possibly adjusting the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6963)|
| 1:56:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6965)|
| 1:56:07| And I think there was also some conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6967)|
| 1:56:09| as to why we even had the policy to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6969)|
| 1:56:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6971)|
| 1:56:13| Which, Mr. Dupler, maybe you can speak to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6973)|
| 1:56:15| I think that was an audit finding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6975)|
| 1:56:17| or something along those terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6977)|
| 1:56:20| And I think, and board members weigh in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6980)|
| 1:56:23| I mean, there was some discussion on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6983)|
| 1:56:24| wanting to see the impact at the end of this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6984)|
| 1:56:27| and where we were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6987)|
| 1:56:29| Am I correct in saying that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6989)|
| 1:56:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6991)|
| 1:56:33| And I think we talked around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6993)|
| 1:56:35| we talked about expectations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6995)|
| 1:56:37| that these are not free and reduced lunch families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=6997)|
| 1:56:40| and that Brett's team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7000)|
| 1:56:42| she and her team are working with families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7002)|
| 1:56:44| that can't, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7004)|
| 1:56:46| to identify those families that need help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7006)|
| 1:56:48| and walk them through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7008)|
| 1:56:50| So she and her team are working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7010)|
| 1:56:51| with families that need help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7011)|
| 1:56:53| and walk them through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7013)|
| 1:56:55| So she went through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7015)|
| 1:56:57| I think it was at that meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7017)|
| 1:56:59| that she went through the dollar amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7019)|
| 1:57:01| that had been increasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7021)|
| 1:57:03| and it was going up and up and up and up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7023)|
| 1:57:05| And so basically, I think, is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7025)|
| 1:57:07| And we talked about the fact that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7027)|
| 1:57:09| that money has to come from somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7029)|
| 1:57:11| So if it continues to go up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7031)|
| 1:57:13| we're going to have to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7033)|
| 1:57:15| make adjustments in our general purpose budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7035)|
| 1:57:17| to allow for additional funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7037)|
| 1:57:19| So if we can, it's more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7039)|
| 1:57:21| the conversation, as I remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7041)|
| 1:57:23| it wasn't about the dollar amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7043)|
| 1:57:25| It was more about having an expectation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7045)|
| 1:57:27| that, you know, we all are kind of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7047)|
| 1:57:30| if we know there's negative consequences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7050)|
| 1:57:32| that we're all a little more likely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7052)|
| 1:57:34| to make sure we do the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7054)|
| 1:57:37| make sure we pay our bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7057)|
| 1:57:39| So I think it was that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7059)|
| 1:57:41| kind of what the conversation was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7061)|
| 1:57:43| Yeah, you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7063)|
| 1:57:45| That is a good summary of the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7065)|
| 1:57:47| and just the expectations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7067)|
| 1:57:49| and the dollar amounts that were going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7069)|
| 1:57:51| And she was kind of summarizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7071)|
| 1:57:53| those dollar amounts, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7073)|
| 1:57:55| monthly or almost weekly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7075)|
| 1:57:57| Like, this is what it looked like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7077)|
| 1:57:59| the first week into two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7079)|
| 1:58:01| Do you mind going over those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7081)|
| 1:58:03| Yeah, you talked about also, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7083)|
| 1:58:05| when you were doing the calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7085)|
| 1:58:07| versus not doing the calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7087)|
| 1:58:09| and what the impact that made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7089)|
| 1:58:11| And so she kind of has data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7091)|
| 1:58:13| that shows that the threat of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7093)|
| 1:58:15| is really kind of helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7095)|
| 1:58:17| If I'm the only one that didn't get to hear the data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7097)|
| 1:58:19| I'm happy to just have it emailed to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7099)|
| 1:58:21| Whatever's easier for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7101)|
| 1:58:23| Either way is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7103)|
| 1:58:25| I mean, I have it right here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7105)|
| 1:58:27| if you just want me to read it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7107)|
| 1:58:29| It's basically from the week of 2-13,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7109)|
| 1:58:31| which is when the calls were turned off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7111)|
| 1:58:33| through essentially today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7113)|
| 1:58:36| There is one week that is missing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7116)|
| 1:58:38| because we, for whatever reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7118)|
| 1:58:40| didn't pull a report that week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7120)|
| 1:58:42| But the week that the calls were turned off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7122)|
| 1:58:44| it was negative 213,557.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7124)|
| 1:58:48| So these are all starting the week on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7128)|
| 1:58:52| So 220 was 235,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7132)|
| 1:58:59| 227 was 258,351.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7139)|
| 1:59:04| 36 was 282,906.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7144)|
| 1:59:11| 321, so this was the week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7151)|
| 1:59:15| we turned calls back on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7155)|
| 1:59:17| because in policy it is written| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7157)|
| 1:59:19| that we do that while school is in session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7159)|
| 1:59:21| so we don't make those calls during breaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7161)|
| 1:59:23| So prior to turning those calls on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7163)|
| 1:59:26| on Monday, 3-21, it was 325,152.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7166)|
| 1:59:33| On 3-24, it was 283,920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7173)|
| 1:59:37| So it went down from 325 to 280| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7177)|
| 1:59:40| in the 280 range once we turned the calls back on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7180)|
| 1:59:42| and started to turn them off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7182)|
| 1:59:44| So it's in in letters again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7184)|
| 1:59:46| 327 was 281,894.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7186)|
| 1:59:49| 4-3 was 295,895.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7189)|
| 1:59:54| 4-10 was 311,039.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7194)|
| 1:59:59| We don't have the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7199)|
| 2:00:01| I don't have an actual number for 4-17,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7201)|
| 2:00:03| but 4-24 was 298,852.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7203)|
| 2:00:07| And then this morning it was 300,171,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7207)|
| 2:00:11| but after lunch it was 304,871.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7211)|
| 2:00:15| I did both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7215)|
| 2:00:17| Thank you, Ms. Foster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7217)|
| 2:00:19| If you could send that, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7219)|
| 2:00:21| And just to be clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7221)|
| 2:00:23| those are actions that the school was taking internally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7223)|
| 2:00:25| You talked about the different pivot points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7225)|
| 2:00:28| in terms of turning on and off things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7228)|
| 2:00:30| Those are levers that we're moving ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7230)|
| 2:00:32| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7232)|
| 2:00:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7234)|
| 2:00:36| And then Mr. Dupler, just to clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7236)|
| 2:00:38| I want to make sure I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7238)|
| 2:00:39| So the contract, because it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7239)|
| 2:00:41| because this policy has been suspended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7241)|
| 2:00:44| would not be in effect this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7244)|
| 2:00:46| And what you're saying is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7246)|
| 2:00:48| even if the contract gets approved this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7248)|
| 2:00:50| it has to come before the board again to get renewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7250)|
| 2:00:52| before it would be acted on in a future year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7252)|
| 2:00:58| No, the administration would have to renew it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7258)|
| 2:01:02| next year for the contract to actually take effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7262)|
| 2:01:06| because this year it would not take effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7266)|
| 2:01:09| Because the collection agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7269)|
| 2:01:11| doesn't begin until the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7271)|
| 2:01:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7273)|
| 2:01:15| So it wouldn't be board action that renewed its administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7275)|
| 2:01:17| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7277)|
| 2:01:19| Administrative action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7279)|
| 2:01:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7281)|
| 2:01:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7283)|
| 2:01:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7285)|
| 2:01:27| So is there any more discussion on that item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7287)|
| 2:01:30| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7290)|
| 2:01:32| I've lost my place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7292)|
| 2:01:34| Ten B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7294)|
| 2:01:36| Ten B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7296)|
| 2:01:37| So item Ten B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7297)|
| 2:01:42| Ten C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7302)|
| 2:01:48| Ten D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7308)|
| 2:01:52| Or Ten E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7312)|
| 2:01:54| I misspoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7314)|
| 2:01:55| Ten E was actually what I meant to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7315)|
| 2:01:57| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7317)|
| 2:02:01| Nothing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7321)|
| 2:02:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7323)|

| 2:02:49| Jennifer, welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7369)|
| 2:02:51| Can you state your name and county of residence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7371)|
| 2:02:54| You have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7374)|
| 2:02:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7379)|
| 2:03:01| Jennifer Rose, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7381)|
| 2:03:02| I just want to thank you guys for taking the time to have the discussion tonight about the ABA policy draft and moving forward for the May 19th policy review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7382)|
| 2:03:12| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7392)|
| 2:03:14| I know some of you guys had some questions, and one of the other ladies speaking will be giving you guys some more information, especially regarding payments and funding for parents or kids that don't necessarily have insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7394)|
| 2:03:27| I do just want to make sure when you guys are talking about it on May 19th that we keep in mind in the policy as far as who deems it medically necessary, because for me and a bunch of parents, we face the same issues time and time again as we get told in IEP meetings that it's the IEP team that has to determine something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7407)|
| 2:03:53| Parents are also supposed to be a meaningful participant in those IEP meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7433)|
| 2:03:59| Our medical doctors are prescribing this, so there's not necessarily someone on the IEP team that can trump that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7439)|
| 2:04:07| Same as I'm going through with my son and issues that I've talked about before that we're having at school with bullying and feeding, his RBT, his ABA therapist can be there to help with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7447)|
| 2:04:23| Being told no, just flat out no with no reason for a medical necessary essential needed service for him is not okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7463)|
| 2:04:34| It's also behavior doesn't necessarily mean just looking at the physical aggression or property destruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7474)|
| 2:04:43| Behavior is, in general, it's how someone acts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7483)|
| 2:04:49| It's anything that a live body can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7489)|
| 2:04:52| Crying is a behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7492)|
| 2:04:54| Interrupting are behaviors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7494)|
| 2:04:56| There are several different forms of behaviors out there that ABA can help with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7496)|
| 2:05:01| Elopement is one of the biggest concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7501)|
| 2:05:05| I had a client today that goes to a Knox County school that eloped during school hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7505)|
| 2:05:13| If our team had been there with him, this would not have happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7513)|
| 2:05:17| If you guys have questions concerning ABA, how we can help, what it looks like, I'm in the schools every day in other districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7517)|
| 2:05:26| We have a team that's in our group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7526)|
| 2:05:30| Anything we can do to help support you guys through this policy review process, we're here to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7530)|
| 2:05:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7536)|
| 2:05:38| Thank you, Jennifer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7538)|
| 2:05:40| Courtney Piper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7540)|
| 2:05:52| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7552)|
| 2:05:53| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7553)|
| 2:05:55| Courtney Piper, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7555)|
| 2:05:57| I want to recognize and encourage KCS and the Board of Education to maintain forward progress with this new comprehensive external therapy provider policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7557)|
| 2:06:08| and ensure it specifically allows for students with autism spectrum disorder to have their applied behavior analyst or ABA therapist join them in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7568)|
| 2:06:16| This is welcomed news that it will be on the May policy review committee agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7576)|
| 2:06:20| I hope our draft policy specific to ABA and the citations used to draft it proved helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7580)|
| 2:06:27| Again, I would like to reiterate my and our groups, which now has more than 140 parents, willingness to collaborate with KCS staff as this policy is being drafted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7587)|
| 2:06:36| We live this life every day and will gladly share our knowledge to develop sound policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7596)|
| 2:06:41| There are three points I'd like to highlight in an effort to make sure they are considered during the drafting and review phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7601)|
| 2:06:46| First, it's critical that any policy redirects the current mindset at KCS, which treats ABA therapy as if it were elective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7606)|
| 2:06:54| and provides a clear process for autism spectrum disorder students to receive medically necessary treatment at school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7614)|
| 2:07:01| Second, current KCS central office staff can supersede orders from a medical doctor and license board certified medical professionals when recommending medical interventions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7621)|
| 2:07:12| In short, the question of who deems what to be medically necessary is an item of high importance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7632)|
| 2:07:19| Third, I want to make it perfectly clear that we want our insurance provided ABA therapists in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7639)|
| 2:07:26| We are not asking KCS to incur the costs of providing ABA therapy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7646)|
| 2:07:31| For background, I'd like to share information about ABA therapy in a classroom setting from my son's board certified behavior analyst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7651)|
| 2:07:38| My son is in kindergarten at Sunnyview Primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7658)|
| 2:07:40| My son also receives 30 hours a week of ABA therapy and he goes to clinic every Thursday now instead of going to school so he can get this therapy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7660)|
| 2:07:51| It was a decision we made in March after asking this question for nearly five months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7671)|
| 2:07:55| Again, my son's BCBA says ABA is a medically necessary treatment for individuals with autism and should not be considered elective in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7675)|
| 2:08:04| ABA is the only therapy approved to treat autism spectrum disorder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7684)|
| 2:08:07| While it is possible to implement behavioral strategies to gain compliance and increase learning in various settings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7687)|
| 2:08:14| ABA in its entirety is a therapeutic intervention designed to treat core deficiencies of autism and cannot be reduced to behavior management strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7694)|
| 2:08:24| Finally, I want to express my appreciation for being selected for the special education task force and hope my contributions will affect positive change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7704)|
| 2:08:33| Thank you and I can answer any questions that you all might have too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7713)|
| 2:08:36| Thank you, Courtney, for your willingness to serve on that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7716)|
| 2:08:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7721)|
| 2:08:43| Allison Pasternak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7723)|
| 2:08:46| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7726)|
| 2:08:49| State your name, county of residence, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7729)|
| 2:08:52| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7732)|
| 2:08:54| Allison Pasternak, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7734)|
| 2:08:56| I want to reiterate some of the things that my fellow parents here have discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7736)|
| 2:09:02| First of all, thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7742)|
| 2:09:03| Sincerely for actually having a discussion about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7743)|
| 2:09:06| I personally have been asking for these services for my son for over three years and have been told no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7746)|
| 2:09:12| So I can't tell you how much it means that we're actually having meaningful discussion about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7752)|
| 2:09:17| So just to address some issues or some concerns that we as parents have about the policy that may be drafted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7757)|
| 2:09:27| First thing is that as parents, we must be given the ability to choose the providers that work with our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7767)|
| 2:09:36| Many of our children have been participating in ABA therapy for quite some time and already have well-established relationships with these providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7776)|
| 2:09:43| All of the parents speaking about ABA tonight feel very passionate about the improvements we've seen in our children and yet most of our children do not even use the same provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7783)|
| 2:09:52| Like many practitioner-patient relationships, ABA is most successful when you find the right provider for your child and we all believe we have done that for our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7792)|
| 2:10:01| The next item that must specifically be addressed in a policy that allows any outside providers to work with children in school is who gets to decide whether or not a child needs this therapy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7801)|
| 2:10:13| My son has documentation from three independent medical professionals who have all recommended ABA therapy as an appropriate form of treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7813)|
| 2:10:22| These providers have worked with my son for many years and are very familiar with his needs and the outcomes that are possible for him if he has the proper support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7822)|
| 2:10:30| Despite this, members of my son's IEP team have stated that it is actually up to them to determine if my son needs ABA at school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7830)|
| 2:10:37| It's imperative that the policy put in place allowing outside ABA providers states that the recommendation of any form of therapy from a medical professional be the final say in whether or not a child receives these therapies in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7837)|
| 2:10:50| ABA can be extremely beneficial in preventing and de-escalating disruptive behaviors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7850)|
| 2:10:56| It can also be life-saving for children who elope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7856)|
| 2:11:00| We've discussed that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7860)|
| 2:11:01| My son doesn't currently exhibit any disruptive behaviors, but he still has what ABA professionals refer to as maladaptive behaviors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7861)|
| 2:11:11| These are such things as difficulty attending to non-preferred tasks, delayed start time of tasks, and trouble completing tasks without prompting and redirection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7871)|
| 2:11:21| While these behaviors are not disruptive, they do prevent him from being as successful as he could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7881)|
| 2:11:26| Working on these behaviors requires a trained ABA professional to be with him to answer, I believe, one of the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7886)|
| 2:11:33| My son currently receives 20 hours of therapy per week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7893)|
| 2:11:36| This is only because we have forfeited some of the hours he's been approved so that he can go to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7896)|
| 2:11:41| And even with that, he's still missing two days per week as opposed to the three days per week he missed for the entire year of sixth grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7901)|
| 2:11:47| So please approve a policy which allows outside providers to work with our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7907)|
| 2:11:51| They need this, they need it soon, and they need it with us having a say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7911)|
| 2:11:57| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7917)|
| 2:11:59| Thank you, Allison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7919)|
| 2:12:01| Jessica?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7921)|
| 2:12:06| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7926)|
| 2:12:12| Jessica Thompson, Knox County. Hello again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7932)|
| 2:12:16| I want to thank you all first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7936)|
| 2:12:19| It's refreshing to hear some of your perspective and testimonies and understanding as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7939)|
| 2:12:25| I wanted to touch base on a couple different things as far as the evidence-based practice of ABA and, you know, with moving forward with the policy review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7945)|
| 2:12:36| Looking at the reason why in the school, the natural environment teaching, which we've touched base on, that is the natural environment for the child and the student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7956)|
| 2:12:48| So for us to be able to be in the school helping the teacher gain that instructional control, with us looking at fading outs, we're not taking over that instruction from the teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7968)|
| 2:13:01| We're helping to increase that so we can target those maladaptive behaviors, which also are targeted behaviors of concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7981)|
| 2:13:09| So whether that is communication, whether that, you know, are those self-stems or the aggression, we're looking at helping fix those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7989)|
| 2:13:18| When it comes to insurance, under the Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse, they do have the Behavioral Health Safety Net Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=7998)|
| 2:13:27| And they have some other ones, too, which are for children that are ages 3 to 17 that qualify, have a qualified mental health diagnosis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8007)|
| 2:13:35| So, you know, there's that for uninsured or underinsured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8015)|
| 2:13:40| There's lots of other things through the states and then also TennCare that can support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8020)|
| 2:13:46| But that was just through research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8026)|
| 2:13:48| I've been a professional in the field and working directly for 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8028)|
| 2:13:53| And so a lot of that was just based on research that's available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8033)|
| 2:13:56| So we're just here, like you all stated, looking at more of that policy for us to be able to come inside and outside providers in the school setting to support, to help those trainings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8036)|
| 2:14:10| So then maybe some of those things can be replicated from the teacher to then, you know, fade us out so that there aren't those needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8050)|
| 2:14:17| The reason why so many hours are approved, if they are, is because ABA is an evidence-based practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8057)|
| 2:14:25| And that repetition and generalization, there are targets that the analyst is doing in the behavior plan that meets and is approved then by insurance of looking at this is what those hours are spent doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8065)|
| 2:14:40| This is the progress that is to be seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8080)|
| 2:14:42| And so that's why every six months, then we look at getting reassessment with the idea of decreasing hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8082)|
| 2:14:50| That's what everyone wants to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8090)|
| 2:14:52| So thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8092)|
| 2:14:54| And if you have any questions, please reach out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8094)|
| 2:14:56| Or, you know, we are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8096)|
| 2:14:59| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8099)|
| 2:15:01| Thank you, Jessica.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8101)|
| 2:15:03| Keith, you're ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8103)|
| 2:15:05| You're up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8105)|
| 2:15:07| Hi, Keith Britt, 506 Milton Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8107)|
| 2:15:09| Like you, Board Member Byke, I had two of my three triplets enrolled in the TEIS early intervention system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8109)|
| 2:15:19| And that is an incredibly impressive program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8119)|
| 2:15:22| And I was particularly impressed by the way it integrates with KCS as children age into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8122)|
| 2:15:27| Both of my boys did not need to integrate into KCS's preschool program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8127)|
| 2:15:31| But I did get to see how that worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8131)|
| 2:15:34| It was seamless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8134)|
| 2:15:37| It was great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8137)|
| 2:15:38| And that's why I was so surprised when I heard these parents come for several months now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8138)|
| 2:15:45| talking about their struggles about getting ABA therapy providers in the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8145)|
| 2:15:50| Because as I heard in the discussion on the Board tonight, it just seems like a no-brainer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8150)|
| 2:15:55| There's really no cost to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8155)|
| 2:15:58| It's augmenting teachers, not replacing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8158)|
| 2:16:01| It should keep kids in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8161)|
| 2:16:04| It should help reduce violence in schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8164)|
| 2:16:06| which is obviously a priority right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8166)|
| 2:16:10| So I am really grateful for the discussion I heard tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8170)|
| 2:16:14| Outside providers for kids that are going to help keep our kids in schools and push learning forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8174)|
| 2:16:20| It seems like it's going to benefit the entire school system, not just the children receiving it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8180)|
| 2:16:25| But I think it's important that you guys explore the providence of why we don't have this yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8185)|
| 2:16:32| Because they have been asking for this for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8192)|
| 2:16:34| So why has there been resistance to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8194)|
| 2:16:37| And I did some background research on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8197)|
| 2:16:39| And it looks like it was simply a security concern, maybe originating out of COVID times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8199)|
| 2:16:44| So I don't think the concerns that may have existed before exist anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8204)|
| 2:16:52| So I don't see any barriers to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8212)|
| 2:16:56| So I very much hope you adopt a policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8216)|
| 2:17:01| And Board Member Christie, I fully agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8221)|
| 2:17:09| This does need to be an accelerated process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8229)|
| 2:17:13| Because if you're planning on getting this in place in August, we saw this with the Knox Prep vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8233)|
| 2:17:19| It was just bad state policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8239)|
| 2:17:22| They hadn't gone through it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8242)|
| 2:17:25| They didn't understand that there could be a 4-4 tie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8245)|
| 2:17:28| So what do you do in that case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8248)|
| 2:17:30| And so you guys need to get this on the plate before the school year starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8250)|
| 2:17:34| So we can work out the kinks before kids start needing that assistance in schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8254)|
| 2:17:39| So thank you for your time, and Godspeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8259)|
| 2:17:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8261)|
| 2:17:43| That concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8263)|
| 2:17:45| Thank you, Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8265)|
| 2:17:48| So moving into board forum, Ms. Deckard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8268)|
| 2:17:52| I just want to welcome Celeste to the board and express my excitement to see everything that she does this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8272)|
| 2:17:58| And I'm just excited to see what she does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8278)|
| 2:18:02| Ms. Ertle, would you like to say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8282)|
| 2:18:09| So hi, my name is Celeste Ertle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8289)|
| 2:18:12| I'm from Bearden High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8292)|
| 2:18:14| And I'm very excited to be working with y'all for the upcoming 2023-2024 school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8294)|
| 2:18:19| And if you have any questions about me or what I'm like, please feel free to come up and talk to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8299)|
| 2:18:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8306)|
| 2:18:28| We're excited to have you here joining us as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8308)|
| 2:18:31| Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8311)|
| 2:18:33| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8313)|
| 2:18:36| I'd just like to thank Cedar Bluff Elementary for letting me sub in the music room this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8316)|
| 2:18:42| It was great fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8322)|
| 2:18:44| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8324)|
| 2:18:46| Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8326)|
| 2:18:48| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8328)|
| 2:18:50| I just wanted to say that we kicked off One Book Read City today in all of our 50 elementary schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8330)|
| 2:18:55| So Superintendent Reiswick and I were at two of the schools this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8335)|
| 2:19:00| They did school-wide assemblies to kick that program off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8340)|
| 2:19:04| And this is just our community-wide reading experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8344)|
| 2:19:07| And the shared goal is to promote reading at home and at school while engaging families in community activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8347)|
| 2:19:13| So I also want to thank Mayor Jacobs for helping us spearhead this initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8353)|
| 2:19:18| And Knox Ed Foundation, the library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8358)|
| 2:19:21| Y'all, it takes a community to lift up this program and execute it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8361)|
| 2:19:26| And we've got a scavenger hunt for kids going on in the community right now at 100 community locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8366)|
| 2:19:34| So I hope that kids take advantage of that for a chance to win a pizza party with Mayor Jacobs at the end of the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8374)|
| 2:19:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8380)|
| 2:19:42| Ms. Spike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8382)|
| 2:19:44| I would like to say thank you to Superintendent Reiswick and KPD and Chief Perriard for their swift action on Friday and communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8384)|
| 2:19:58| I really appreciated that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8398)|
| 2:20:00| And I have gotten a lot of emails and a lot of calls, and I have not responded to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8400)|
| 2:20:05| But I have read them, and I am going through them and taking it very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8405)|
| 2:20:09| So I'm so sorry to all the students and families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8409)|
| 2:20:14| At West High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8414)|
| 2:20:16| Thank you. Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8416)|
| 2:20:18| Thank you, Madam Chair. I would just say to all those administrators and teachers who are watching, thank you for your hard work this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8418)|
| 2:20:26| And the last several days of school are always challenging, so hang in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8426)|
| 2:20:31| You're almost at the end, so just thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8431)|
| 2:20:34| And I'm sure we don't have graduates watching, but congratulations again to the 2023 graduates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8434)|
| 2:20:41| And it's always, I know many of us have said before, that's literally like the most fun thing we get to do as school board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8441)|
| 2:20:49| So I look forward to that, and congratulations to those graduates and their parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8449)|
| 2:20:54| That's like the Super Bowl every year, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8454)|
| 2:20:57| And we are recognizing many on Thursdays, in Thursday's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8457)|
| 2:21:03| Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8463)|
| 2:21:05| All right. With that, our meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8465)|
| 2:21:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230501?start=8471)|
