| 0:00:44| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=44)|

| 0:00:46| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=46)|
| 0:00:47| All right, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=47)|
| 0:00:48| This is maybe our best attendance in a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=48)|
| 0:00:49| And I just want to thank everybody for coming out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=49)|
| 0:01:02| The way this committee works is we mainly just receive applications for name changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=62)|
| 0:01:09| And because sometimes we don't receive one for a long time, we have to do the meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=69)|
| 0:01:16| just when we have enough applications to do one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=76)|
| 0:01:20| In this situation, the first application was filed quite a long time ago, but we never| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=80)|
| 0:01:25| received another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=85)|
| 0:01:26| So we decided to hold the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=86)|
| 0:01:28| And then the second application, I hadn't known it was in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=88)|
| 0:01:36| But that's how we ended up here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=96)|
| 0:01:38| So I really appreciate people responding to the emails about setting these meetings, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=98)|
| 0:01:44| that's, unless somebody's got a better way to do it, I think that's the best way for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=104)|
| 0:01:50| us to handle our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=110)|
| 0:01:52| But since I think we've got some new faces, why don't we go around the room and introduce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=112)|
| 0:01:57| yourself and I guess just state perhaps where you live or who you represent, if you represent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=117)|
| 0:02:04| a government agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=124)|
| 0:02:05| Ms. Davis, if you can start, and we'll just go around the room this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=125)|
| 0:02:09| I'm Sharon Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=129)|

| 0:03:12| Amy Midas, Forest Heights neighborhood in Bearden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=192)|
| 0:03:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=197)|
| 0:03:18| Well, thank you, and thank you all for coming out and serving the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=198)|
| 0:03:22| With that, we'll get started with the two items on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=202)|
| 0:03:25| The first one is an ordinance to change the street name of Riley Drive between Renford Road and Hollywood Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=205)|
| 0:03:31| to Charles Newman Drive, and David Williams is the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=211)|
| 0:03:35| Mr. Williams, if you'd like to come to the podium and state your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=215)|
| 0:03:39| and explain to us why you filed this application and why you think Charles Newman Drive is a worthy name for that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=219)|
| 0:03:49| David Williams, residing at 505 Hollywood Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=229)|
| 0:03:52| I'm president of the Pontiac Neighborhood Association, and I appreciate you all's fine work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=232)|
| 0:03:58| Charles Newman is my great-grandfather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=238)|
| 0:04:01| He built a house, which currently still stands on Sutherland, in 1929.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=241)|
| 0:04:06| There are not very many houses from that era left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=246)|
| 0:04:09| and I dare to say that there's probably one left where the descendants of the original people are still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=249)|
| 0:04:15| And my great-granddad was a civic leader, businessman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=255)|
| 0:04:20| He was in the grocery business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=260)|
| 0:04:22| He owned and operated Fifth Avenue Market in the 1920s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=262)|
| 0:04:27| and the 1930s and 1940s he was on Locust Street, pretty close to here, and had a cafe in the market house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=267)|
| 0:04:33| And during the Great Depression, being the fact that he loved people and people loved him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=273)|
| 0:04:39| he took the risk of carrying a lot of people on credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=279)|
| 0:04:43| And this helped a lot of people get by through the Great Depression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=283)|
| 0:04:47| Also, when he built his house, where it is at today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=287)|
| 0:04:51| he was able to hire a lot of out-of-work carpenters, brick masons, plumbers, and electricians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=291)|
| 0:04:56| and a number of people from the Grey Knox Marble Mill on Sutherland and Marble City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=296)|
| 0:05:01| And along comes his brother, the Wilkerson family, the Melanies, and other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=301)|
| 0:05:06| as we really got organized and started building Pond Gap in the modern era.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=306)|
| 0:05:11| And for this reason, we want to honor him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=311)|
| 0:05:14| He, like I say, loved people. People loved him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=314)|
| 0:05:16| He did his best to help people, regardless of race, religion, creed, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=316)|
| 0:05:21| And he knew hard work, grew up on a farm, was a fireman on a railroad for a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=321)|
| 0:05:25| and that's really difficult work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=325)|
| 0:05:28| And, like I say, his legacy still lives with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=328)|
| 0:05:32| His great-grandson has tried to carry on in his tradition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=332)|
| 0:05:36| And this road, Riley, really doesn't have any connection or meaning with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=336)|
| 0:05:42| In 54, when Pond Gap Road was renamed Hollywood Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=342)|
| 0:05:46| the Hollywood Hill subdivision north of Paper Mill had the idea of Crosby Drive after being Crosby and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=346)|
| 0:05:53| Lamore Road after Dorothy Lamore and so forth, which was fine and good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=353)|
| 0:05:56| but none of these people lived in the Pond Gap community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=356)|
| 0:06:00| And Riley was the life of Riley, if you remember William Bendix playing that role on TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=360)|
| 0:06:04| And no one's street address will change with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=364)|
| 0:06:09| The six properties that border on this road, usually the Sutherland, Hollywood, or Renford, is a street address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=369)|
| 0:06:15| So we felt like this would be a good thing to do, honor the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=375)|
| 0:06:19| build up some interest in everything, and give honor to what I think was a real nice gentleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=379)|
| 0:06:25| I've got some pictures. I can answer any questions, whatever you need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=385)|
| 0:06:30| Does the committee have any questions for Mr. Williams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=390)|
| 0:06:37| You say there would be no change of addresses for any of the property owners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=397)|
| 0:06:41| No, sir. The four use Sutherland, one uses Hollywood, and one Renford as an address, both mailing and street address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=401)|
| 0:06:49| So it will not change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=409)|
| 0:06:55| Is the street an alley, or is it, I guess it's a named street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=415)|
| 0:07:00| We would like to give it a little more dignified term than that, but basically, yes, very narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=420)|
| 0:07:06| I noticed in the MPC minutes that a property owner, I guess adjacent, had some concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=426)|
| 0:07:16| Tony Cappiello, I guess he was concerned about the confusion for delivery services in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=436)|
| 0:07:25| Do you have any response to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=445)|
| 0:07:27| His address has always been 516 Renford. It's on his mailbox. GPS can find it very easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=447)|
| 0:07:38| I'm just trying to, through conjecture and my imagination, trying to find why he'd want to object.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=458)|
| 0:07:43| I think renaming that Charles Newman will give a positive accent to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=463)|
| 0:07:48| It might help him run his property and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=468)|
| 0:07:51| Every delivery man, I know the FedEx man, the UPS man, they can find his place, the mailman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=471)|
| 0:07:56| I just don't understand why he objected to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=476)|
| 0:08:00| Now, I talked to his office several times and also sent him two certified letters, which he refused to open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=480)|
| 0:08:09| And one was the application form where you say yea or nay if you're in favor or opposed to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=489)|
| 0:08:19| All right. Does anybody have any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=499)|
| 0:08:28| Ms. Reiner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=508)|
| 0:08:29| So the property that had an objection, I'm looking at the map here and I'm fairly familiar with Sutherland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=509)|
| 0:08:35| The corner property here at Renford and Sutherland, is that a florist there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=515)|
| 0:08:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=520)|
| 0:08:41| Is that the property that objected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=521)|
| 0:08:43| Real estate, Hallmark Realty, and there's a floral shop in the basement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=523)|
| 0:08:48| Next door we have two psychiatrists and then the Newman property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=528)|
| 0:08:53| And then on the corner was a Coop Cafe, soon to be Stork, no, Stock Burgers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=533)|
| 0:08:59| And then my house on Hollywood and then you've got the property there on Riley Drive, the gentleman in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=539)|
| 0:09:05| So your property on Hollywood is the next on the side of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=545)|
| 0:09:09| 505.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=549)|
| 0:09:10| Okay. And so there are no mailboxes on Riley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=550)|
| 0:09:14| None of these properties based in Sutherland have mailboxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=554)|
| 0:09:18| No, no mailboxes on Riley at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=558)|
| 0:09:24| So no one's going to have to order a new stationery or anything by this change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=564)|
| 0:09:28| Nothing will change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=568)|
| 0:09:31| Next up, Dwayne Reese.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=571)|
| 0:09:41| Just for historical benefit, that road came about in 1940| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=581)|
| 0:09:44| when Earl of Worsham built some houses in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=584)|
| 0:09:47| and really only went halfway from Hollywood in there, then the rest was extended to Renford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=587)|
| 0:10:01| All right. Does anybody else have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=601)|
| 0:10:03| I know there's some other people that live in the area on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=603)|
| 0:10:17| If not, I'd entertain a motion to approve it or deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=617)|
| 0:10:22| Move the adoption of the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=622)|
| 0:10:27| Okay, we've got a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=627)|
| 0:10:29| Is there any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=629)|
| 0:10:32| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=632)|
| 0:10:33| Okay, we've got a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=633)|
| 0:10:35| All those in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=635)|
| 0:10:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=637)|
| 0:10:38| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=638)|
| 0:10:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=639)|
| 0:10:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=640)|
| 0:10:41| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=641)|
| 0:10:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=642)|
| 0:10:43| Could you real briefly tell me what happens next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=643)|
| 0:10:47| It will be placed on the city council agenda as an ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=647)|
| 0:10:51| and I'm not sure it won't be for next meeting, I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=651)|
| 0:10:54| It would be the following meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=654)|
| 0:10:57| So June 7th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=657)|
| 0:10:58| It will be placed on ordinances for first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=658)|
| 0:11:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=661)|
| 0:11:02| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=662)|
| 0:11:06| And June 21st would be the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=666)|
| 0:11:10| My thanks to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=670)|
| 0:11:11| We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=671)|
| 0:11:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=672)|
| 0:11:13| Thank you for coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=673)|
| 0:11:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=674)|
| 0:11:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=676)|
| 0:11:17| Our second application is an ordinance to change the street name of Milligan Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=677)|
| 0:11:22| between East Magnolia Avenue and Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue to Billborn Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=682)|
| 0:11:27| And Reverend Harold Middlebrook is the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=687)|
| 0:11:32| Reverend, if you can state your name and address for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=692)|
| 0:11:36| and tell us a little bit about this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=696)|
| 0:11:38| My name is Harold Middlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=698)|
| 0:11:40| I live at 2334 Dandridge Avenue in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=700)|
| 0:11:45| In 2012, a group of people who were called the Institute of Change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=705)|
| 0:11:54| who had been created by community shares, I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=714)|
| 0:11:58| started a move to rename the street part of Milligan for Billborn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=718)|
| 0:12:07| They got kind of lax and it fell through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=727)|
| 0:12:10| And a few months ago, I was told that they had started the project but did nothing with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=730)|
| 0:12:17| And so a group of us picked it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=737)|
| 0:12:20| Billborn has operated and is operating Jarnigan & Sons Mortuary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=740)|
| 0:12:27| Jarnigan & Sons was formed in 1886, has been a funeral home in this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=747)|
| 0:12:35| serving the community for a number of years, providing assistance, support and comfort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=755)|
| 0:12:41| Many of the people who end up at Jarnigan & Sons, some of them have no insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=761)|
| 0:12:48| some of them have very little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=768)|
| 0:12:51| And Billborn and his staff have gone out of their way to serve people in that community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=771)|
| 0:12:57| many times almost free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=777)|
| 0:13:01| He has also been involved in a number of community agencies, both city and county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=781)|
| 0:13:08| and gives himself constantly every year to the Martin Luther King Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=788)|
| 0:13:13| to a number of other entities that exist in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=793)|
| 0:13:18| And so we decided, a group of us, to ask that this street be named.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=798)|
| 0:13:25| There are no residences on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=805)|
| 0:13:28| There are no houses on Milligan between Martin Luther King and Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=808)|
| 0:13:35| There are eight pieces of property that are abutted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| Each of the owners have already signed an agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=819)|
| 0:13:44| The only one that did not sign lives in New Jersey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=824)|
| 0:13:48| We sent her a certified letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=828)|
| 0:13:51| She returned the letter unopened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=831)|
| 0:13:54| In fact, even refused to sign for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=834)|
| 0:13:57| And so we are petitioning this body to grant approval for the naming of that street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=837)|
| 0:14:04| Short street, eight pieces of property, as I said, that abutted the sides of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=844)|
| 0:14:11| But no house or residence or business actually facing the street as it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=851)|
| 0:14:20| Thank you, Reverend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=860)|
| 0:14:23| That was very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=863)|
| 0:14:26| Does anyone from the committee have any questions for the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=866)|
| 0:14:33| I'd like to make a motion to approve the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=873)|
| 0:14:37| So I second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| All right, we've got a motion to second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=879)|
| 0:14:41| I certainly think it's a worthy motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=881)|
| 0:14:43| And I want to apologize to you about the confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=883)|
| 0:14:46| Just so the committee knows, when there's a street renaming, it's kind of a long process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=886)|
| 0:14:53| When we change the name of an actual street name, it starts at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=893)|
| 0:14:58| And then it comes here and then it goes to council for two readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=898)|
| 0:15:02| So it's getting quite a bit of review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=902)|
| 0:15:05| So for both of these applicants, this is their second body they've been in front of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=905)|
| 0:15:10| But we had some confusion and it ended up on council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=910)|
| 0:15:12| But it needed to come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=912)|
| 0:15:15| For those who are new, we also have what we call an honorary street naming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=915)|
| 0:15:19| where the street remains the same so no one has to change their address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=919)|
| 0:15:23| which both these applicants have talked about today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=923)|
| 0:15:27| And a lot of times we encourage people to name things, do the honorary route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=927)|
| 0:15:33| because it is difficult to get people to change their names unless you have streets like we've had today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=933)|
| 0:15:38| So that's just a little background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=938)|
| 0:15:40| But certainly a very worthy application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=940)|
| 0:15:44| A great person, Bill Born, a great man in Knoxville and for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=944)|
| 0:15:51| So we've got a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=951)|
| 0:15:53| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=953)|
| 0:15:56| Okay, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=956)|
| 0:15:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=958)|
| 0:15:59| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=959)|
| 0:16:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=960)|
| 0:16:01| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=961)|
| 0:16:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=962)|
| 0:16:04| Unless anybody else has any comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=964)|
| 0:16:06| June 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=966)|
| 0:16:08| June 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=968)|
| 0:16:11| Actually, since yours was on the, I believe it's actually next Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=971)|
| 0:16:18| It's going to be on for next Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=978)|
| 0:16:20| That's because we postponed it for two weeks last time knowing this meeting was tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=980)|
| 0:16:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=989)|
| 0:16:30| In the draft I saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=990)|
| 0:16:31| But I can touch base with you, but I believe it will be Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=991)|
| 0:16:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=994)|
| 0:16:35| Thank you, members of the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=995)|
| 0:16:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=998)|
| 0:16:39| Unless anybody has any comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=999)|
| 0:16:40| Thank you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=1000)|
| 0:16:41| Sometimes these meetings can be short, but sometimes they can be long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=1001)|
| 0:16:45| We've got to really hash it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=1005)|
| 0:16:46| But these were two worthy applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=1006)|
| 0:16:50| So unless anybody has any questions or comments, we're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=1010)|
| 0:16:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160518?start=1014)|
