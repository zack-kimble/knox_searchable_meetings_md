| 0:03:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=231)|
| 0:03:52| MPC, we've been postponing this thing for about two or three months now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=232)|

| 0:03:59| Can I ask MPC, we've been postponing this one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=239)|
| 0:04:03| We're going to lose a year, I guess, in the process, but keep postponing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=243)|
| 0:04:06| Do we have an end site kind of thing where we're going to get the information to whatever neighborhood groups wanted it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=246)|
| 0:04:12| and we can move on with the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=252)|

| 0:04:20| So we just need another two weeks to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=260)|
| 0:04:22| Hopefully Mr. Redman and others will be able to take a look at that and compare and come up with any other issues that they have at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=262)|
| 0:04:32| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=272)|

| 0:04:46| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=286)|
| 0:04:47| So that is postponed for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=287)|
| 0:04:49| And Councilman Campin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=289)|
| 0:04:51| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=291)|
| 0:04:52| I also would like to postpone item 10A for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=292)|
| 0:04:57| I've got more communication between the interested parties and hopefully we'll have some resolve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=297)|
| 0:05:06| So four weeks for 10A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=306)|
| 0:05:08| 10A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=308)|
| 0:05:09| That's the appeal by Deborah Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=309)|
| 0:05:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=310)|
| 0:05:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=311)|
| 0:05:12| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=312)|
| 0:05:13| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=313)|

| 0:05:19| Anything else for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=319)|
| 0:05:22| Move to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=322)|
| 0:05:23| That will certainly shorten the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=323)|
| 0:05:28| Keep on going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=328)|

| 0:06:38| A lot of smiles will be on the engineers' faces and the neighbors', I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=398)|
| 0:06:43| Second, I want to invite everyone to come to the World's Fair Park on Monday, July 4th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=403)|
| 0:06:48| for the City's Festival on the 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=408)|
| 0:06:50| This year will be even bigger and better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=410)|

| 0:06:58| with red, white, and blue lights starting June 27th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=418)|
| 0:07:02| I'm told it's pretty dramatic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=422)|
| 0:07:04| Of course, the Symphony Orchestra will perform the finale at Festival on the 4th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=424)|
| 0:07:09| and there'll be great food and music throughout the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=429)|

| 0:07:18| The fireworks start at 9.30 and with Visit Knoxville's help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=438)|
| 0:07:22| we've made them louder, bigger, and more colorful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=442)|
| 0:07:25| So bring your earplugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=445)|

| 0:08:04| We only have three more shows for the Variety Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=484)|

| 0:08:11| So don't come on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=491)|
| 0:08:13| It's a makeup performance following a rainout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=493)|

| 0:08:40| This will be the Ensemble Swing Time, a 16-piece big band| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=520)|
| 0:08:44| that features original arrangements made famous by Glenn Miller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=524)|
| 0:08:48| Harry James, the Dorsey Brothers, and other great bands from the swing era.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=528)|
| 0:08:52| So put on your saddle shoes and such and come on down and dance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=532)|
| 0:08:56| Are you directing the bands or just the music?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=536)|
| 0:09:00| The music of the bands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=540)|
| 0:09:02| Then the Thursday concert series concludes June 30th with the Blue Line Blues Band,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=542)|
| 0:09:07| which is made up of Knoxville police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=547)|
| 0:09:10| Yes, we definitely want to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=550)|
| 0:09:12| That's June 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=552)|
| 0:09:14| So a friendly reminder, a number of changes are related to parking downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=554)|
| 0:09:20| and in the Cumberland Avenue corridor will take effect on Friday, July 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=560)|
| 0:09:25| As part of a comprehensive approach to managing public parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=565)|
| 0:09:29| in downtown and in Fort Sanders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=569)|
| 0:09:31| the city is installing more than 1,000 new parking meters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=571)|
| 0:09:35| adjusting rates for on-street and garage parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=575)|
| 0:09:38| and increasing parking enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=578)|
| 0:09:41| We've had a successful public meeting about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=581)|
| 0:09:45| where all of these were outlined not too long ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=585)|
| 0:09:48| The changes are really about creating more turnover of parking spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=588)|
| 0:09:52| in high-demand areas and better managing on-street parking spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=592)|
| 0:09:57| which are, as you all know, a limited resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=597)|
| 0:10:00| Overall, there are plenty of places to park downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=600)|
| 0:10:03| We want to ensure that short-term diners and shoppers can find a place to park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=603)|
| 0:10:09| while we encourage long-term parkers who want to stay and play for a longer period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=609)|
| 0:10:14| that they choose from the 7,500 spaces in city-owned garages and lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=614)|
| 0:10:20| 7,500, so there's plenty of spaces, long-term spaces downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=620)|
| 0:10:25| Starting July 1st, the Public Building Authority will be assigning six officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=625)|
| 0:10:30| to enforce parking regulations throughout downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=630)|
| 0:10:33| So if you got away with it before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=633)|
| 0:10:36| you're going to have to follow the rules now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=636)|
| 0:10:39| We are enforcing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=639)|
| 0:10:41| In addition, four PBA officers will be handling parking enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=641)|
| 0:10:45| in the Cumberland Avenue area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=645)|
| 0:10:48| Okay, listen up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=648)|
| 0:10:49| Violators parking in commercial loading zones or no parking zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=649)|
| 0:10:53| will be subject to immediate towing, as always.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=653)|
| 0:10:57| The same remains true for motorists with multiple outstanding tickets for meter violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=657)|
| 0:11:03| You know who you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=663)|
| 0:11:04| I'm not looking at anybody in this room, but they know who they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=664)|
| 0:11:09| It's also worth remembering that any funds generated from parking activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=669)|
| 0:11:13| do not go to the City Council budget, do not go to the Mayor's Office budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=673)|
| 0:11:17| but they go to support parking infrastructure and downtown amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=677)|
| 0:11:22| So we're going to get the turnover, and any fines that we collect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=682)|
| 0:11:26| will go back for parking infrastructure and downtown amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=686)|
| 0:11:30| So please pay attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=690)|
| 0:11:32| Look for signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=692)|
| 0:11:34| Be alert to this because there are some changes being made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=694)|
| 0:11:37| For more information about public parking in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=697)|
| 0:11:40| visit www.knoxvilletn.gov slash parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=700)|
| 0:11:46| So go to the City website, and it's slash parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=706)|
| 0:11:49| So one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=709)|
| 0:11:52| Two meetings from now on July 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=712)|
| 0:11:55| Our next meeting is July 5th, right after Fourth of July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=715)|
| 0:11:58| And then on July 19th, these meetings will be moved to 6 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=718)|
| 0:12:04| You know, for years we've met at 7 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=724)|
| 0:12:06| The Council has voted, and we will start meeting at 6 p.m. starting July 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=726)|
| 0:12:14| So that's the end of my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=734)|
| 0:12:18| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=738)|
| 0:12:19| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=739)|
| 0:12:20| I just wanted to bring light again to the third ribbon cutting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=740)|
| 0:12:25| that we've had in regards to the urban wilderness last Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=745)|
| 0:12:29| We cut the ribbon on the Devil's Racetrack, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=749)|
| 0:12:34| It's a .8-mile double black diamond trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=754)|
| 0:12:37| It's the only one that's unique to the East Coast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=757)|
| 0:12:40| and it is a sight to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=760)|
| 0:12:43| And it's certainly going to bring a lot of people into Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=763)|
| 0:12:46| Have you tried it yourself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=766)|
| 0:12:47| Never will try it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=767)|
| 0:12:48| Never will try it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=768)|
| 0:12:49| I promise you, you've got to be a professional to go down this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=769)|
| 0:12:55| But it was made possible by the $100,000 grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=775)|
| 0:12:58| that Knoxville overwhelmingly won in social media voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=778)|
| 0:13:04| I guess it was about a year ago we got 26,000 votes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=784)|
| 0:13:07| and just blasted Asheville and I think San Francisco out of the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=787)|
| 0:13:12| But again, it adds actually about seven miles of new trails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=792)|
| 0:13:19| for 50 total miles in the urban wilderness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=799)|
| 0:13:24| A couple of weeks before, we cut the ribbon on the bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=804)|
| 0:13:28| that went over Red Bud that connected the urban wilderness into this land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=808)|
| 0:13:32| And all in all, we've preserved about 1,100 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=812)|
| 0:13:36| that's right in our downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=816)|
| 0:13:40| It just keeps getting better and better for Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=820)|
| 0:13:43| and for this regional attraction, and I couldn't be more excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=823)|
| 0:13:47| And I also would like to remind folks that I have my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=827)|
| 0:13:51| Coffee with the Councilman this Saturday morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=831)|
| 0:13:54| at the 26th Coffee with the Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=834)|
| 0:13:56| I put the math to it the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=836)|
| 0:13:59| And it will be held at the world-famous Roundup Restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=839)|
| 0:14:03| Great breakfast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=843)|
| 0:14:05| So I'll be there from 9 o'clock until the last person is heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=845)|
| 0:14:09| And just come by and have coffee or breakfast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=849)|
| 0:14:12| and come fuss at me or you can come hug my neck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=852)|
| 0:14:15| Either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=857)|
| 0:14:19| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=859)|
| 0:14:21| Hopefully they'll hug your neck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=861)|
| 0:14:23| I'm hoping for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=863)|
| 0:14:25| Gently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=865)|
| 0:14:32| Is it on now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=872)|
| 0:14:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=873)|
| 0:14:34| Okay, I wanted to remind people of the Coomba Festival| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=874)|
| 0:14:37| which will be going on this Friday through Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=877)|
| 0:14:41| And it will start at Market Square on Friday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=881)|
| 0:14:45| and then on Saturday and Sunday will be at Morningside Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=885)|
| 0:14:51| Normally for years it was at Chill Highway Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=891)|
| 0:14:54| but this will be the second year at Morningside Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=894)|
| 0:14:57| just off of Danwich Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=897)|
| 0:14:59| So I wanted to remind people to come out and attend that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=899)|
| 0:15:02| There will be music and plenty of fun| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=902)|
| 0:15:05| and cultural activities for the Coomba Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=905)|

| 0:21:53| Councilman Delahunty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1313)|
| 0:21:54| Yes, I can't resist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1314)|
| 0:21:55| I'm going to ask Mr. Hagerman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1315)|
| 0:21:56| if he would tell us just briefly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1316)|
| 0:21:57| what we're doing here on Broadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1317)|
| 0:21:59| with the signal system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1319)|
| 0:22:00| and how that works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1320)|
| 0:22:01| to help CAT do its business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1321)|
| 0:22:04| Jim Hagerman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1324)|
| 0:22:05| Director of Engineering for the City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1325)|
| 0:22:07| The main thrust of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1327)|
| 0:22:10| is for the buses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1330)|
| 0:22:14| to communicate with the signal system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1334)|
| 0:22:17| so that the signal system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1337)|
| 0:22:19| can give them some priority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1339)|
| 0:22:21| at green lights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| so they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1343)|
| 0:22:26| stay on time, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1346)|
| 0:22:31| There's also some software| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1351)|
| 0:22:33| that goes along with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1353)|
| 0:22:34| that optimizes the rest of the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1354)|
| 0:22:37| so that it doesn't actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1357)|
| 0:22:39| mess up the synchronization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| Giving them a little bit of extra time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1362)|
| 0:22:44| it continues to stay synchronized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1364)|
| 0:22:46| The grant would also provide funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| for some customer amenities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1369)|
| 0:22:55| like bus stop shelters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1375)|
| 0:22:59| and some sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1379)|
| 0:23:01| and some pedestrian signals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| and that kind of thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1384)|
| 0:23:06| to make it easier to use the bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| Okay, we have the transfer station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| up there on Broadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1391)|
| 0:23:12| and this, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1392)|
| 0:23:14| there's a lot of traffic on Broadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| both cars and buses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1396)|
| 0:23:18| and this is going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1398)|
| 0:23:19| not have to stop those battleships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| you can move them through the lights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1401)|
| 0:23:23| and not have to hit the brakes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1403)|
| 0:23:25| where you go every light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1405)|
| 0:23:26| and you're stopping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| and burning a lot of fuel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1409)|
| 0:23:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1410)|
| 0:23:31| Without disrupting other vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1411)|
| 0:23:34| or hopefully improving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1414)|
| 0:23:37| for other vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1417)|
| 0:23:39| Just maximizing the timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1419)|
| 0:23:40| Yes, and this fits in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1420)|
| 0:23:42| with our other citywide ATMS project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1422)|
| 0:23:45| this complements it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| and makes them both work better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1427)|
| 0:23:50| Thank you for the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1430)|
| 0:23:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1431)|
| 0:23:52| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1432)|
| 0:23:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1433)|
| 0:23:54| This is certainly an exciting agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1434)|
| 0:23:57| Do you have any ability to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| if we have a good chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1439)|
| 0:24:01| or not of obtaining the grant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1441)|
| 0:24:03| I think we have a good chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1443)|
| 0:24:06| but it's definitely not guaranteed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1446)|
| 0:24:08| I couldn't put odds on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| It's a very competitive grant process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1451)|
| 0:24:13| It is competitive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1453)|
| 0:24:14| and this is a pretty big ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| We're asking for more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| than is typical for this grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1460)|
| 0:24:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1461)|
| 0:24:22| I just want to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1462)|
| 0:24:23| it's fantastic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1463)|
| 0:24:24| to be working to improve transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| When might we know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1466)|
| 0:24:27| Do you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1467)|
| 0:24:28| when they'll make a decision on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1468)|
| 0:24:30| I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1470)|
| 0:24:31| but Mr. Rhodes back there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| might have a better idea than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1473)|
| 0:24:35| This is Chris Rhodes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1475)|
| 0:24:36| who works with our consultants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1476)|
| 0:24:39| on this project, Kimley Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1479)|
| 0:24:45| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1485)|
| 0:24:46| Please state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1486)|
| 0:24:48| Chris Rhodes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1488)|
| 0:24:49| with Kimley Horn and Associates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1489)|
| 0:24:51| We are writing the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1491)|
| 0:24:52| on behalf of the Department of Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1492)|
| 0:24:54| It's a TDOT statewide competition grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1494)|
| 0:24:57| History tells us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| four to five months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1499)|
| 0:25:01| so probably by the end of the calendar year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1501)|
| 0:25:03| the city would know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1503)|
| 0:25:04| if they received the grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1504)|
| 0:25:05| and then you would go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1505)|
| 0:25:06| into a contract with the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1506)|
| 0:25:08| just like they would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1508)|
| 0:25:09| any other transportation project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1509)|
| 0:25:11| where they're using federal funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1513)|
| 0:25:14| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1514)|
| 0:25:15| Did you have any more questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1515)|
| 0:25:16| Can I ask a question before we leave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1516)|
| 0:25:17| Is this the type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1517)|
| 0:25:18| where you have to do the work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1518)|
| 0:25:20| If you get the grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1520)|
| 0:25:21| you do the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1521)|
| 0:25:22| and then get reimbursed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1522)|
| 0:25:23| or is it a front-end grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| that enables you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1524)|
| 0:25:25| to pay the cost as you go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| It's a you pay as you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| In other words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1529)|
| 0:25:30| during the design phase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1530)|
| 0:25:32| the city would pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| the design consultant's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| monthly invoice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1535)|
| 0:25:36| and then you would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1536)|
| 0:25:38| turn that in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1538)|
| 0:25:39| for a reimbursement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1539)|
| 0:25:40| So on a month-to-month basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1540)|
| 0:25:41| you would ask for reimbursement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1541)|
| 0:25:42| for either design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1542)|
| 0:25:43| planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1543)|
| 0:25:44| construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1544)|
| 0:25:45| You don't have to wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1545)|
| 0:25:46| until the end of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| No sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=1547)|

| 0:49:42| it's not a big number, but we have a 66% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=2982)|

| 0:49:54| And they weren't necessarily all that serious an injury,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=2994)|
| 0:49:57| but they were injuries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=2997)|
| 0:49:58| And so it raises our ratables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=2998)|
| 0:50:00| Our insurance broker shopped it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3000)|
| 0:50:03| to all the folks who do this kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3003)|
| 0:50:05| And this is the best price they would give us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3005)|
| 0:50:07| based on that previous experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3007)|
| 0:50:09| It is like a 60-some percent increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3009)|
| 0:50:12| from the previous year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3012)|

| 0:51:51| we were truly a board that studied the financials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3111)|
| 0:51:54| hired the manager, and lobbied city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3114)|
| 0:51:56| for help with capital needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3116)|
| 0:51:58| We were somewhat separate from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3118)|
| 0:52:00| I was told this was because in the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3120)|
| 0:52:03| about 55 years ago, those that created the auditorium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3123)|
| 0:52:06| and coliseum and made it separate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3126)|
| 0:52:11| as they did not want the wrath of Cass Walker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3131)|
| 0:52:13| to fall on them, as he did not like the idea of spending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3133)|
| 0:52:17| for entertainment venues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3137)|
| 0:52:20| It stayed being supervised by the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3140)|
| 0:52:22| until a couple years ago when the city informed us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3142)|
| 0:52:24| there was going to be a change and we would no longer be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3144)|
| 0:52:26| a board as such but an advisory committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3146)|
| 0:52:30| Our appointments would be the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3150)|
| 0:52:31| Each council person and the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| would nominate their constituents to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3153)|
| 0:52:36| and they would report back to them on happenings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3156)|
| 0:52:39| At one time, the World's Fair site and the exhibition hall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3159)|
| 0:52:42| under the Holiday Inn was also a part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3162)|
| 0:52:43| of the facilities we oversaw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3163)|
| 0:52:46| The big convention center was never a part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3166)|
| 0:52:49| but Chihuahua Park did become a facility we oversaw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3169)|
| 0:52:52| and is still a part of the group today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3172)|
| 0:52:55| In 2010, Councilman Nick Pavlis nominated me again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3175)|
| 0:52:58| to serve on the board and in 2013,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3178)|
| 0:53:00| I was elected to chair the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3180)|
| 0:53:03| We meet four or five times per year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| ask questions, give advice and suggestions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| and kind of keep an eye on the things for council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3187)|
| 0:53:11| and for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3191)|
| 0:53:13| It has been a wonderful experience to be on a board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3193)|
| 0:53:15| that does not have to raise money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3195)|
| 0:53:17| and is in the know of what good things are happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3197)|
| 0:53:19| in the entertainment field in the city and the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3199)|
| 0:53:23| I have seen changes that SMG has made in less than a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3203)|
| 0:53:27| and they are worthy changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| The city has worked with employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3209)|
| 0:53:31| which was a concern to the board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3211)|
| 0:53:33| and has found places for those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3213)|
| 0:53:35| who wanted to stay city employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3215)|
| 0:53:37| and made arrangements for others who wanted to go to SMG| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3217)|
| 0:53:40| and have an opportunity to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3220)|
| 0:53:42| For that, I say thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3222)|
| 0:53:45| I also want to make sure I thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3225)|
| 0:53:47| for all being wise enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3227)|
| 0:53:49| to take our current auditorium and coliseum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3229)|
| 0:53:51| and improve it on the current grounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3231)|
| 0:53:53| where it has become an important part of our downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3233)|
| 0:53:56| without all the parking problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3236)|
| 0:53:58| I wish there was some way to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| with an advisory board to oversee our facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3240)|
| 0:54:03| even though they will be contracted out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3243)|
| 0:54:07| Those are hard words for a union member to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3247)|
| 0:54:09| contracted out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3249)|
| 0:54:11| Having advisory board members is a way for council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3251)|
| 0:54:13| to know what is going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3253)|
| 0:54:15| without taking up more of their time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3255)|
| 0:54:16| and it builds support in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3256)|
| 0:54:18| for citizens to have a place to become more knowledgeable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3258)|
| 0:54:21| of all the good things going on in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3261)|
| 0:54:24| I thank you for allowing me to serve on this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3264)|
| 0:54:28| Thank you, Sylvia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3268)|
| 0:54:29| Thank you for your leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3269)|
| 0:54:31| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3271)|
| 0:54:34| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3274)|
| 0:54:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3275)|
| 0:54:36| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3276)|
| 0:54:37| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3277)|
| 0:54:46| So we are to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3286)|
| 0:54:47| Before we start that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3287)|
| 0:54:48| I failed to tell you this during my report earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3288)|
| 0:54:52| but you may have noticed that our deputy to the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3292)|
| 0:54:55| and chief policy officer, Bill Lyons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3295)|
| 0:54:57| is not here with us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3297)|
| 0:54:59| He's actually in Memphis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3299)|
| 0:55:00| His mother passed away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3300)|
| 0:55:02| Thought you would want to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3302)|
| 0:55:03| She was 95 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3303)|
| 0:55:05| So she lived a nice long life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3305)|
| 0:55:09| and she was in nursing care, had been sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3309)|
| 0:55:13| So it wasn't a big surprise to him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3313)|
| 0:55:16| but it still obviously lost his mom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3316)|
| 0:55:18| So our hearts and prayers go out to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3318)|
| 0:55:20| The service is on Thursday in Memphis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3320)|
| 0:55:24| I thought you all would want to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3324)|
| 0:55:27| So now public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3327)|
| 0:55:30| We have six people signed up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3330)|
| 0:55:31| so I'll call them in this order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3331)|
| 0:55:34| Cindy Abernathy, Drew Krikow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3334)|
| 0:55:37| Eddie Young, Xavier Presley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3337)|
| 0:55:41| Sam Emmons, and Tiara Lady Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3341)|
| 0:55:44| So if Cindy Abernathy would come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3344)|
| 0:55:48| And appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3348)|
| 0:55:50| Ask that you state your name and address for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3350)|
| 0:55:53| and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3353)|
| 0:55:58| Mayor, can we reverse the first and second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3358)|
| 0:56:01| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3361)|
| 0:56:02| You would like Drew first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3362)|
| 0:56:03| Myself first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3363)|
| 0:56:04| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3364)|
| 0:56:06| I had you down for three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3366)|
| 0:56:07| Okay, go ahead, Eddie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3367)|
| 0:56:08| State name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3368)|
| 0:56:10| Yeah, Eddie Young, 1709 Campfire Drive, Knoxville 37931.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3370)|
| 0:56:20| Things have changed on the heels of the recent evictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3380)|
| 0:56:22| of the homeless residents along Second Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3382)|
| 0:56:25| Reports of increased violence in the Mission District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3385)|
| 0:56:28| from members of the homeless community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3388)|
| 0:56:29| and I've witnessed these myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3389)|
| 0:56:32| indicate that these evictions occurring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3392)|
| 0:56:34| without providing an alternative place to live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3394)|
| 0:56:36| has destabilized the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3396)|
| 0:56:41| And it seems to me that this is the very result| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3401)|
| 0:56:43| our city is working towards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3403)|
| 0:56:46| And if you're not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3406)|
| 0:56:47| well, you're doing a really damn good job of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3407)|
| 0:56:51| Forcing the absence of stability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3411)|
| 0:56:54| so that they don't become comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3414)|
| 0:56:57| so that we're not seen as giving up or enabling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3417)|
| 0:57:02| operating off the premise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3422)|
| 0:57:04| that sustaining and increasing their trauma| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3424)|
| 0:57:08| is the most effective way to drive them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3428)|
| 0:57:10| to the many resources that they apparently choose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3430)|
| 0:57:13| not to avail themselves to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3433)|
| 0:57:15| And you'll hear Cindy talk more about this after me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3435)|
| 0:57:19| But you criminalize and you marginalize these folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3439)|
| 0:57:22| to the extent that you create chaos| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3442)|
| 0:57:25| and you chase away any obligation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3445)|
| 0:57:27| that they may have to play by the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3447)|
| 0:57:32| And obviously, this is not healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3452)|
| 0:57:35| Substance abuse rises to meet and cope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3455)|
| 0:57:38| with the new levels of stress and trauma,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3458)|
| 0:57:41| maybe some reaching for it for the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3461)|
| 0:57:46| Instead of getting up in somewhat rested condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3466)|
| 0:57:50| and going to find work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3470)|
| 0:57:51| these neighbors of ours are looking for a place to live now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3471)|
| 0:57:55| and we wonder why some just give up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3475)|
| 0:58:00| Some move away, which is a shame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3480)|
| 0:58:03| I know of friends of mine who've moved away from Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3483)|
| 0:58:06| and it is a shame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3486)|
| 0:58:07| They loved Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| But running folks out of town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3489)|
| 0:58:11| whether it's intentionally or unintentionally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3491)|
| 0:58:13| doesn't address the problem of homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3493)|
| 0:58:15| It just redirects it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3495)|
| 0:58:18| The same applies to the problem with our shortage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3498)|
| 0:58:21| in resource of shelter and the consequent need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3501)|
| 0:58:24| for temporary residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3504)|
| 0:58:27| There are more than 800 people experiencing homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3507)|
| 0:58:30| in this city on a given night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3510)|
| 0:58:32| The current point in time count is 748.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3512)|
| 0:58:35| That's a generous number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| A point in time count is only the ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3517)|
| 0:58:39| that you can find on a given night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3519)|
| 0:58:44| So realistically, we're experiencing somewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3524)|
| 0:58:46| between eight and 1,200 people who have nowhere to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3526)|
| 0:58:51| And the city, according to HMIS, has 450 beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3531)|
| 0:58:59| When you evict these folks without providing an alternative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3539)|
| 0:59:02| you're not solving the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3542)|
| 0:59:05| You're just like the last pawn on the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3545)|
| 0:59:07| chasing the king around and you're never gonna catch him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3547)|
| 0:59:12| I don't understand why this is so hard to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3552)|
| 0:59:15| These folks will be somewhere tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| They won't just disappear and reappear in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3557)|
| 0:59:22| In response to the constant assertion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3562)|
| 0:59:24| that everyone already has these rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3564)|
| 0:59:26| let's just say that everyone does already have these rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3566)|
| 0:59:30| at least in theory, although I would argue that they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3570)|
| 0:59:35| Our emphasis with this bill, this Homeless Bill of Rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3575)|
| 0:59:38| is to make it illegal to discriminate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3578)|
| 0:59:40| based on one's housing status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3580)|
| 0:59:43| This is exactly what discrimination is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3583)|
| 0:59:46| the unequal treatment of someone based on their race,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3586)|
| 0:59:51| their religion, their gender, disability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3591)|
| 0:59:53| housing status, others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3593)|
| 0:59:57| to discriminate when they supposedly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3597)|
| 1:00:01| in theory, have equal rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3601)|
| 1:00:05| You have one minute, Mr. Young.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3605)|
| 1:00:07| We would assert that homelessness describes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3607)|
| 1:00:09| a class of people deserving of a protected status| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3609)|
| 1:00:12| based on the systemic discrimination that they face daily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3612)|
| 1:00:15| And in response to the recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| that we pursue this work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3617)|
| 1:00:18| through the Mayor's Roundtable on Homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3618)|
| 1:00:20| I say, well, this just makes no sense at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3620)|
| 1:00:22| It actually makes me wonder if the City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3622)|
| 1:00:24| understands what the Mayor's Roundtable is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3624)|
| 1:00:26| and what purpose it serves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3626)|
| 1:00:28| We're not here to help coordinate service providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3628)|
| 1:00:31| or implement the Roundtable's plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| We're here to fight for the human and civil rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3633)|
| 1:00:36| of the homeless of this city in the form of a bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3636)|
| 1:00:38| that would codify the assurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3638)|
| 1:00:41| that those who supposedly have equal rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3641)|
| 1:00:44| are allowed to exercise them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3644)|
| 1:00:46| And the Roundtable has no power to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3646)|
| 1:00:50| I just can't get my head around the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3650)|
| 1:00:52| having such a blind spot on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3652)|
| 1:00:54| We have homegrown refugees living among us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3654)|
| 1:00:56| and rather than guarding against sending the message| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3656)|
| 1:00:58| that we've given up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3658)|
| 1:00:59| by providing a sense of stability for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| we should be guarding against sending the message| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| that homelessness is acceptable in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3663)|
| 1:01:06| And this is the very message we send| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3666)|
| 1:01:08| when we refuse to acknowledge the vast gap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3668)|
| 1:01:11| between the number of those experiencing homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| and the resources that can immediately address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3673)|
| 1:01:16| Even those who are accessing resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3676)|
| 1:01:19| live in a gap between,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| and for many, that gap can last for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3681)|
| 1:01:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3685)|
| 1:01:26| And one who's experienced this is Cindy Abernathy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3686)|
| 1:01:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3688)|
| 1:01:31| Ms. Abernathy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3691)|
| 1:01:44| Thank you for being here, Ms. Abernathy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3704)|
| 1:01:45| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3705)|
| 1:01:48| I'm Cindy Abernathy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3708)|
| 1:01:49| I currently am homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3709)|
| 1:01:53| and very nervous right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3713)|
| 1:01:56| Just take your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3716)|
| 1:01:59| I have come from almost 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3719)|
| 1:02:02| I am a felony offender| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3722)|
| 1:02:05| and have fought the system for almost 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3725)|
| 1:02:10| I've fought the system for almost 10 years of being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3730)|
| 1:02:16| I am an abuse, I've been through an abuse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3736)|
| 1:02:21| and through that, I have had doors shut in my face| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3741)|
| 1:02:28| through various programs and everything that have been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3748)|
| 1:02:33| that they say is out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3753)|
| 1:02:35| I've been through the VMC, CAC, Homeward Bound,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3755)|
| 1:02:41| Habitat for Humanity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3761)|
| 1:02:44| I've been through Angelic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3764)|
| 1:02:48| CARM, which I'm banned from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3768)|
| 1:02:51| VMC, now I'm banned from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3771)|
| 1:02:54| thanks to an ex-husband who put me through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3774)|
| 1:02:57| 15 years of abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3777)|
| 1:03:01| Plus, me being a felon, they tend to frown on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3781)|
| 1:03:06| I have had doors shut in my face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3786)|
| 1:03:12| Cruelty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3792)|
| 1:03:17| Churches have shut their doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3797)|
| 1:03:22| There's a lot of churches that me being a felon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3802)|
| 1:03:25| that they do not like us in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3805)|
| 1:03:28| I have, I now have somebody saying that they're,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3808)|
| 1:03:38| you know, they're not really opening the doors yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3818)|
| 1:03:42| but they're gonna say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3822)|
| 1:03:44| we're gonna give you a slight chance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3824)|
| 1:03:47| and I'm still not really through that door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3827)|
| 1:03:52| I've been through Section 8,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3832)|
| 1:03:56| they've turned me down because of a felon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3836)|
| 1:04:00| and because of the ex-husband that I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3840)|
| 1:04:05| A survivor standing here in front of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3845)|
| 1:04:08| through that abuse, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3848)|
| 1:04:15| It's been a long, hard 10 years of being out here homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3855)|
| 1:04:19| living under bridges, hiding in woods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3859)|
| 1:04:24| having cops uproot you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3864)|
| 1:04:27| I've been uprooted 15 times through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3867)|
| 1:04:32| Everywhere I go, even if it's in a public place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3872)|
| 1:04:36| have been told to leave, whether I'm not doing anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3876)|
| 1:04:41| whether people around me that I'm talking to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3881)|
| 1:04:45| or whatever in the case may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3885)|
| 1:04:49| And cops tend to know me by my last name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3889)|
| 1:04:53| thanks to my ex-husband and my felony,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3893)|
| 1:04:57| which is pretty rough trying to do things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3897)|
| 1:05:00| when you're having doors slammed in your face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3900)|
| 1:05:04| So, it's hard to really put 10 years into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3904)|
| 1:05:10| and try to express the, of my felony and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3910)|
| 1:05:19| how hard it has been to do the footwork| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3919)|
| 1:05:23| without people's help, without the programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3923)|
| 1:05:27| because they're saying you cannot do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3927)|
| 1:05:30| and everything, to finally have an open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3930)|
| 1:05:33| that I can do it, and I can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3933)|
| 1:05:39| It's still iffy, because they're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3939)|
| 1:05:42| as of yesterday, I got the call stating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3942)|
| 1:05:46| that I may not even get that chance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3946)|
| 1:05:50| because they're already trying to turn me down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3950)|
| 1:05:52| before I get in there, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3952)|
| 1:05:56| You have one minute, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3956)|
| 1:05:59| It's just, as a felon, being out here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3959)|
| 1:06:03| it's not as easy when you stay, or trying to get a job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3963)|
| 1:06:08| when you put homeless, and you put a felon on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3968)|
| 1:06:12| them automatically throwing the application in the trash,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3972)|
| 1:06:15| along with housing and everything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3975)|
| 1:06:18| because they do not want felons in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3978)|
| 1:06:22| So, with that being said, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3982)|
| 1:06:25| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3985)|
| 1:06:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3987)|
| 1:06:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3987)|
| 1:06:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3988)|
| 1:06:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3989)|
| 1:06:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3990)|
| 1:06:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3991)|
| 1:06:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3992)|
| 1:06:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3992)|
| 1:06:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3993)|
| 1:06:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3994)|
| 1:06:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3995)|
| 1:06:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3996)|
| 1:06:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3997)|
| 1:06:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=3997)|
| 1:06:47| Hello, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4007)|
| 1:06:49| State your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4009)|
| 1:06:51| Andrew Crickow, and still, currently, homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4011)|
| 1:06:55| Member of the Knoxville Homeless Collective, also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4015)|
| 1:06:59| We are still continuing to go forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4019)|
| 1:07:02| in revisions to our Homeless Bill of Rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4022)|
| 1:07:05| We have taken out the section which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4025)|
| 1:07:09| covered personal solicitations, or as several other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4029)|
| 1:07:14| have referred to it, it was panhandling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4034)|
| 1:07:17| We've taken out the section that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4037)|
| 1:07:19| had concerning public intoxication and the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4039)|
| 1:07:24| to a breathalyzer or other definitive tests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4044)|
| 1:07:26| to determine whether the person being questioned about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4046)|
| 1:07:31| is actually intoxicated or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4051)|
| 1:07:33| Because apparently there is no state legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4053)|
| 1:07:36| concerning pedestrians and the burden of proof| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4056)|
| 1:07:39| whether they are intoxicated or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4059)|
| 1:07:42| So we've taken that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4062)|
| 1:07:44| We've also changed some of the language and some of the points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4064)|
| 1:07:47| that we were currently trying to discuss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4067)|
| 1:07:53| such as the right to use rest, meaning sit or recline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4073)|
| 1:07:59| and move freely in public spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4079)|
| 1:08:02| including but not limited to public sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4082)|
| 1:08:04| public parks, public land, public transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4084)|
| 1:08:07| and public buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4087)|
| 1:08:09| And we insist we are not fighting for the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4089)|
| 1:08:12| to set up a tent city in World's Fair Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4092)|
| 1:08:15| That is not our intention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4095)|
| 1:08:17| Our intention is that we are trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4097)|
| 1:08:18| to decriminalize the unfortunate necessity of having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4098)|
| 1:08:23| to have a place to go to set up a camp to be able to rest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4103)|
| 1:08:27| until we can overcome the boundaries that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4107)|
| 1:08:29| are set against us to be able to get into housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4109)|
| 1:08:32| to be able to get employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4112)|
| 1:08:34| We're just trying to decriminalize it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4114)|
| 1:08:36| to where we don't get run off every time we try to lay down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4116)|
| 1:08:40| and get some rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4120)|
| 1:08:44| At the beginning of this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4124)|
| 1:08:46| a number was given for parking places in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4126)|
| 1:08:50| 7,500 parking places for your car to be able to sit and rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4130)|
| 1:08:57| But where is there any space for a human being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4137)|
| 1:09:02| to be able to sit and rest and not be harassed for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4142)|
| 1:09:10| We've changed as far as one of the other points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4150)|
| 1:09:15| as we were trying to get approved areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4155)|
| 1:09:20| to be able to rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4160)|
| 1:09:22| We've changed the wording on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4162)|
| 1:09:23| to the right to use designated areas sanctioned by the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4163)|
| 1:09:27| as temporary living spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4167)|
| 1:09:30| We put the word temporary in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4170)|
| 1:09:32| to reemphasize the fact that we are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4172)|
| 1:09:34| trying to make homelessness a way of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4174)|
| 1:09:38| Again, we're just trying to decriminalize it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4178)|
| 1:09:40| because until those that are seeking and being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4180)|
| 1:09:44| able to be approved for the resources that are available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4184)|
| 1:09:47| to get into the housing, felonies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4187)|
| 1:09:51| as has been said time and time again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4191)|
| 1:09:53| are one of the main hindrances for people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4193)|
| 1:09:55| to be able to get employment and housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4195)|
| 1:09:57| because the restrictions are so severe that there's even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4197)|
| 1:10:01| people that have been refused housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4201)|
| 1:10:04| for a 10-year-old charge for grand theft lawnmower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4204)|
| 1:10:09| This is ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4209)|
| 1:10:10| It really is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4210)|
| 1:10:15| We continue with our efforts to get this bill passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4215)|
| 1:10:20| But as we have been advised earlier this month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4220)|
| 1:10:24| these rights are already available to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4224)|
| 1:10:29| These rights already exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4229)|
| 1:10:32| My question is, where is it stated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4232)|
| 1:10:36| What does the legislation actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4236)|
| 1:10:38| say for these rights that we supposedly already have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4238)|
| 1:10:43| I would like to see it where it's written down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4243)|
| 1:10:46| be it state legislation, county, or city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4246)|
| 1:10:50| I want to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4250)|
| 1:10:52| And we also have requested a workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4252)|
| 1:11:00| to be able to get all of you at one time, at one place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4260)|
| 1:11:05| a place of your choosing where we could have drinks, snacks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4265)|
| 1:11:08| however it needs to be done, to discuss this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4268)|
| 1:11:12| within an hour, two hours time frame,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4272)|
| 1:11:14| and get it done and over with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4274)|
| 1:11:17| And we've been refused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4277)|
| 1:11:19| So we'll just keep coming here every other week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4279)|
| 1:11:24| and do this in five-minute increments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4284)|
| 1:11:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4286)|
| 1:11:27| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4287)|
| 1:11:28| Next is Mr. Xavier Presley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4288)|
| 1:11:35| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4295)|
| 1:11:36| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4296)|
| 1:11:38| Xavier Presley, 1134 Glade Hill Drive, 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4298)|
| 1:11:42| I was here a while ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4302)|
| 1:11:43| And since you people don't take me serious enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4303)|
| 1:11:45| I guess I'll have to just get it out to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4305)|
| 1:11:47| and say I'm trying to embarrass you all now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4307)|
| 1:11:49| Because the way you've got these polices sitting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4309)|
| 1:11:52| hiding behind trees, parking their vehicles in this traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4312)|
| 1:11:56| where we're supposed to be driving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4316)|
| 1:11:57| but it's OK for them to give citations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4317)|
| 1:12:00| under them conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4320)|
| 1:12:02| I was here a while ago and asked you all to have it either stopped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4322)|
| 1:12:04| or do something about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4324)|
| 1:12:06| Next time I come here, I guess I said it too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4326)|
| 1:12:10| I got a ticket for one of your offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4330)|
| 1:12:12| Finally, you all could have told me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4332)|
| 1:12:14| that you had a police review board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4334)|
| 1:12:16| Clarence Vaughn, I finally talked to him today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4336)|
| 1:12:19| and filed a complaint about this citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4339)|
| 1:12:21| And it's in Ms. Brenda Palmer's neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4341)|
| 1:12:24| So I guess when I brought her name up at the last time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4344)|
| 1:12:26| I was here, you figured you'd follow me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4346)|
| 1:12:28| until you give me a ticket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4348)|
| 1:12:29| And that's what ended up happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4349)|
| 1:12:31| It's like two blocks from my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4351)|
| 1:12:32| And the way the office is set up is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4352)|
| 1:12:34| I'm coming to down Wesley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4354)|
| 1:12:36| And you've got a big old tree park built right there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4356)|
| 1:12:40| on the corner where we have to come to a stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4360)|
| 1:12:43| And then you have to pull up further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4363)|
| 1:12:46| to see around the tree in case some traffic is coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4366)|
| 1:12:51| That's when the officer jumped out of his car, ran to my vehicle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4371)|
| 1:12:54| said you didn't come to a complete stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4374)|
| 1:12:56| That's a joke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4376)|
| 1:12:57| I called my insurance company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4377)|
| 1:12:59| I called DMV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4379)|
| 1:13:00| And they said, bring it to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4380)|
| 1:13:03| I'm just trying to get this $114 ticket because he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4383)|
| 1:13:07| wanted to give out tickets that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4387)|
| 1:13:09| And I'm going to go to Mr. Vaughn tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4389)|
| 1:13:11| and let him discuss this with him as far as that complaint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4391)|
| 1:13:14| and see just how many tickets that officer wrote that day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4394)|
| 1:13:18| at that stop sign where he's blocking traffic because he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4398)|
| 1:13:23| wanted to give out tickets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4403)|
| 1:13:25| I was looking at World News tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4405)|
| 1:13:26| and they call these cops tax collectors for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4406)|
| 1:13:32| And that's about what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4412)|
| 1:13:35| After that, now I want to give you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4415)|
| 1:13:37| some little bit of credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4417)|
| 1:13:38| ESPN today announced that Zabion Dotson is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4418)|
| 1:13:41| going to get the Arthur Ashe Heroic Award in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4421)|
| 1:13:46| So there's some good things happening here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4426)|
| 1:13:48| But the worst thing and the most valuable thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4428)|
| 1:13:50| that hurt my feelings the past two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4430)|
| 1:13:52| was this article you all put in the Knox News| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4432)|
| 1:13:55| Seminar about Muhammad Ali.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4435)|
| 1:13:58| You gave him an obituary picture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4438)|
| 1:14:01| but you gave this big-ass gorilla| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4441)|
| 1:14:03| a picture bigger than the whole paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4443)|
| 1:14:06| That's sad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4446)|
| 1:14:06| That's very sad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4446)|
| 1:14:08| I took this paper to Muhammad Ali's funeral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4448)|
| 1:14:10| I got interviewed by ESPN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4450)|
| 1:14:12| I got interviewed by Sports Illustrated, the Associated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4452)|
| 1:14:16| Press, and every newspaper that wanted to hear my complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4456)|
| 1:14:21| Even China had a live TV station there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4461)|
| 1:14:24| interviewing us and interpreting this back to China.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4464)|
| 1:14:29| Everybody that we had put, we had some protesters there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4469)|
| 1:14:33| And I was the only positive protester there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4473)|
| 1:14:35| but they had put all the protesters together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4475)|
| 1:14:37| I had eight signs, and this was on one of my signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4477)|
| 1:14:41| People really thought, this is how y'all treat us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4481)|
| 1:14:45| This place is so racist to the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4485)|
| 1:14:47| that where you just put it out in public now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4487)|
| 1:14:50| And it's very sad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4490)|
| 1:14:52| It is very sad that this is how people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4492)|
| 1:14:53| have to feel about Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4493)|
| 1:14:55| I moved here 10 years ago from Miami,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4495)|
| 1:14:57| and I moved up here to officiate high school and college sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4497)|
| 1:15:01| And they're so racist in their association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4501)|
| 1:15:04| that I just plainly quit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4504)|
| 1:15:06| You just don't care about how you treat people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4506)|
| 1:15:09| And some of the people that took pictures of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4509)|
| 1:15:11| and put it online, they said, oh, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4511)|
| 1:15:14| expect that from East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4514)|
| 1:15:17| I'm beginning to believe that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4517)|
| 1:15:19| One time I was up here, I came up here and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4519)|
| 1:15:21| I love this place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4521)|
| 1:15:22| But after seeing this article with Muhammad Ali| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4522)|
| 1:15:26| with an obituary-sized picture, and you get a gorilla,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4526)|
| 1:15:30| more credit than you gave Muhammad Ali, that's really sad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4530)|
| 1:15:34| This gorilla is in section E, and he's in section F,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4534)|
| 1:15:38| and he's on the front page of the newspaper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4538)|
| 1:15:41| on the Sunday's paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4541)|
| 1:15:42| This gorilla couldn't wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4542)|
| 1:15:44| This gorilla couldn't wait till Monday or Tuesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4544)|
| 1:15:47| or another day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4547)|
| 1:15:49| He shouldn't have been here to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4549)|
| 1:15:51| But I'm going to see Mr. Vaughn tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4551)|
| 1:15:53| and I'm going to Cleveland to help LeBron celebrate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4553)|
| 1:15:57| that championship Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4557)|
| 1:15:59| I'm taking this paper with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4559)|
| 1:16:00| I'm going to Orlando next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4560)|
| 1:16:02| I'm taking this paper with me, and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4562)|
| 1:16:04| going to be part of the eulogy and part of his ceremony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4564)|
| 1:16:10| that I went to from now on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4570)|
| 1:16:13| Thank you, Mr. Pressley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4573)|
| 1:16:16| Next is Sam Emmons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4576)|
| 1:16:23| Thank you for being here, Mr. Emmons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4583)|
| 1:16:25| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4585)|
| 1:16:27| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4587)|
| 1:16:29| OK, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4589)|
| 1:16:30| I'm Sam Emmons, and I live at 301 Woodlawn Pike, apartment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4590)|
| 1:16:36| J1 here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4596)|
| 1:16:40| This will be a little bit different than having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4600)|
| 1:16:46| a specific issue particularly to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4606)|
| 1:16:50| But yeah, I'm a graduate student at UT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4610)|
| 1:16:54| and a member of a local church here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4614)|
| 1:16:57| Like you, like all of you, I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4617)|
| 1:17:00| to be helpful, constructive, make a positive difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4620)|
| 1:17:06| in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4626)|
| 1:17:09| I'm encouraged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4629)|
| 1:17:10| I'm encouraged by the efforts that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4630)|
| 1:17:14| have been taken by you, the mayor, the council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4634)|
| 1:17:19| things like the Save Our Sons initiative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4639)|
| 1:17:22| and all the programs that are a part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4642)|
| 1:17:25| There are a lot of good things going on in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4645)|
| 1:17:30| So thank you for caring about the well-being of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4650)|
| 1:17:33| This is a great city, and there is still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4653)|
| 1:17:38| plenty of need, as we know, as is anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4658)|
| 1:17:43| I don't have all the answers, but I do have a few things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4663)|
| 1:17:47| that I thought of and some rhetorical questions that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4667)|
| 1:17:51| are hopefully helpful and beneficial to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4671)|
| 1:17:55| and the city in the long run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4675)|
| 1:17:59| So tonight, I'll be talking about kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4679)|
| 1:18:01| of a big, little bit uncomfortable topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4681)|
| 1:18:05| OK, kind of uncomfortable topic, and that is hate, hatred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4685)|
| 1:18:11| So I'll ask some questions and give some ideas about hatred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4691)|
| 1:18:15| and then look at what might make a difference against that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4695)|
| 1:18:21| in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4701)|
| 1:18:24| So there are some basic questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4704)|
| 1:18:28| to consider when thinking through hatred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4708)|
| 1:18:32| So where does hatred currently cause pain and suffering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4712)|
| 1:18:38| in the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4718)|
| 1:18:42| Who is hateful in the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4722)|
| 1:18:46| Who is hateful in the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4726)|
| 1:18:48| I would humbly submit that we all can be at times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4728)|
| 1:18:56| I know I can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4736)|
| 1:18:59| You know, someone cuts me off or is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4739)|
| 1:19:01| driving some obnoxious 17-foot tall pickup truck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4741)|
| 1:19:04| and I'm like, man, wouldn't the city be better off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4744)|
| 1:19:07| without that person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4747)|
| 1:19:08| And I don't think I'm the only one, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4748)|
| 1:19:12| But I know this kind of thinking is destructive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4752)|
| 1:19:16| There's something wrong in it, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4756)|
| 1:19:18| don't want to operate that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4758)|
| 1:19:22| Proverbs 10, 12 says, hatred stirs up strife,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4762)|
| 1:19:27| but love covers all sins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4767)|
| 1:19:30| Which one would we rather have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4770)|
| 1:19:35| What do we want for the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4775)|
| 1:19:38| What can change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4778)|
| 1:19:40| What brings peace and compassion to a city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4780)|
| 1:19:44| Is it just behavior modification and education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4784)|
| 1:19:48| or is there something more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4788)|
| 1:19:52| Is there something more to life than that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4792)|
| 1:19:54| Is it deeper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4794)|
| 1:19:55| Is there a deeper need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4795)|
| 1:19:59| What did one of history's most influential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4799)|
| 1:20:02| and controversial figures, Jesus, say about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4802)|
| 1:20:08| Love your neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4808)|
| 1:20:10| What else did he say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4810)|
| 1:20:12| What else did he say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4812)|
| 1:20:15| And this is crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4815)|
| 1:20:16| Love your enemy, people who are against you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4816)|
| 1:20:22| How is that possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4822)|
| 1:20:26| We trust in God's justice and accept the free gift| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4826)|
| 1:20:30| that he gave us, even though we hated him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4830)|
| 1:20:33| You have one minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4833)|
| 1:20:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4834)|
| 1:20:35| This love really can make a difference in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4835)|
| 1:20:41| and in us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4841)|
| 1:20:47| It's not that we, you know, another reason we hate people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4847)|
| 1:20:52| is we want to put people down and build ourselves up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4852)|
| 1:20:56| This is not the way that Jesus would have us do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4856)|
| 1:21:02| He would have us walk with him, in him, be built up in him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4862)|
| 1:21:06| humble ourselves, and he will lift us up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4866)|
| 1:21:10| So I would just ask, is it possible that Jesus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4870)|
| 1:21:14| 2,000 years later?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4874)|
| 1:21:15| I know, maybe it sounds crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4875)|
| 1:21:17| Is it possible that he could still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4877)|
| 1:21:20| have a great impact in Knoxville and eradicate hate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4880)|
| 1:21:25| from its streets?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4885)|
| 1:21:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4887)|
| 1:21:28| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4888)|
| 1:21:32| Now we have Tiara Lady Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4892)|
| 1:21:34| Thank you for being here, and please state your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4894)|
| 1:21:36| and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4896)|
| 1:21:38| And you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4898)|
| 1:21:40| Thank you, Mayor and Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4900)|
| 1:21:42| My name is Tiara Lady Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4902)|
| 1:21:43| I reside at 522 Pertinex Drive, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4903)|
| 1:21:49| I stand before you all as a native Knoxvilian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4909)|
| 1:21:52| with deep roots in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4912)|
| 1:21:54| My original address was 1153 Nelson Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4914)|
| 1:21:59| in the heart of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4919)|
| 1:22:01| 1153 Nelson Street in the heart of Austin Homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4921)|
| 1:22:08| I also stand before you as a mother,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4928)|
| 1:22:11| and I also stand before you as an advocate for youth, teens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4931)|
| 1:22:15| and young adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4935)|
| 1:22:17| I commend you, Mayor, with your initiative for Save Our Sons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4937)|
| 1:22:20| And I commend the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4940)|
| 1:22:22| for your deep concern, especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4942)|
| 1:22:24| with our chief of police, with the recent violence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4944)|
| 1:22:27| and the things that are happening in East Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4947)|
| 1:22:30| and other places around the city that maybe not be very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4950)|
| 1:22:33| much publicized as much as East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4953)|
| 1:22:37| I stand before you with concerns, questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4957)|
| 1:22:40| but I'm also a solution-oriented individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4960)|
| 1:22:43| So I don't come before you with just concerns and criticisms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4963)|
| 1:22:46| but I also bring before you solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4966)|
| 1:22:50| I'm so grateful about the partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4970)|
| 1:22:53| to bring about the Change Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4973)|
| 1:22:55| That is with partnership with Overcoming Believers Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4975)|
| 1:22:59| But my question is, when the Change Center opens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4979)|
| 1:23:02| that's almost a year from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4982)|
| 1:23:05| Summer began on yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4985)|
| 1:23:07| So what are our kids going to do this summer and on next summer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4987)|
| 1:23:12| I began to think about my summers coming here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4992)|
| 1:23:16| in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4996)|
| 1:23:17| I was blessed enough to have a father who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4997)|
| 1:23:19| became a US Air Force man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=4999)|
| 1:23:22| And I traveled the world, but I would come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=5002)|
| 1:23:24| during the summer times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=5004)|
| 1:23:25| And I would spend my summers under the leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=5005)|
| 1:23:28| and guidance of the late Jenny Lakins at New Hope Recreation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=5008)|
| 1:23:32| Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=5012)|
| 1:23:33| And I thought about my time at what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=5013)|
| 1:23:36| used to be the Eastside Family YMCA and swim in that pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=5016)|
| 1:23:42| So my question and my seeking of what can our children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=5022)|
| 1:23:46| do now this summer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=5026)|
| 1:23:49| I started saying, where are the safe places for our kids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=5029)|
| 1:23:52| My two children back there, they are ages 9 and 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=5032)|
| 1:23:57| They stay out playing until 9.30 because it's still daylight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=5037)|
| 1:24:02| So the question becomes, what do our preteens, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=5042)|
| 1:24:05| do our teen and our young adults, where do they go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=5045)|
| 1:24:09| And we know that an idle mind is what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=5049)|
| 1:24:11| The devil's workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=5051)|
| 1:24:12| So they get into everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=5052)|
| 1:24:14| And I thought about when I was in graduate school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=5054)|
| 1:24:17| I was a city employee with Parks and Recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=5057)|
| 1:24:19| I worked with Vic Fowler at the Adaptive Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=5059)|
| 1:24:24| And I started wondering, the safe places are right here already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=5064)|
| 1:24:28| Parks and Recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=5068)|
| 1:24:30| But when I started doing my research and in calling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=5070)|
| 1:24:33| most of them close at 5 or 6 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=5073)|
| 1:24:37| Our city pools, they close at 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=5077)|
| 1:24:42| So the question becomes, where are our babies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=5082)|
| 1:24:45| going at 5 and 6 o'clock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=5085)|
| 1:24:48| So my solution for you all today is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=5088)|
| 1:24:51| to consider making our Parks and Recreation centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=5091)|
| 1:24:54| These buildings are already here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=5094)|
| 1:24:57| These are places that our kids already go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=5097)|
| 1:25:00| How about us looking at extending the hours during the summer months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=5100)|
| 1:25:04| to maybe 10 o'clock so that preteens, teens, and young adults| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=5104)|
| 1:25:09| can have a place to actually go in a safe environment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=5109)|
| 1:25:13| I also challenged the city to extend the pools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=5113)|
| 1:25:17| In East Knoxville, there is two pools that are readily available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=5117)|
| 1:25:22| Not readily available, I take that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=5122)|
| 1:25:25| There is one pool, but it's not open daily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=5125)|
| 1:25:27| to the community in the 1415 community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=5127)|
| 1:25:32| That's at the E.V. Davidson Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=5132)|
| 1:25:34| It's not open daily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=5134)|
| 1:25:36| That pool should be open daily for the kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=5136)|
| 1:25:38| to be able to partake and swim at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=5138)|
| 1:25:42| Also, there's the Adaptive Center that could be a pool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=5142)|
| 1:25:45| but it really was not made to be a city pool for that community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=5145)|
| 1:25:50| but to actually help with special needs populations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=5150)|
| 1:25:54| You have one minute, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=5154)|
| 1:25:55| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=5155)|
| 1:25:56| And so the solution would be, as I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=5156)|
| 1:25:58| to maybe extend our Parks and Recreation hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=5158)|
| 1:26:02| so that the children in that area actually have a place to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=5162)|
| 1:26:05| and to also extend the pool hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=5165)|
| 1:26:08| so that the citizens have a place to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=5168)|
| 1:26:11| after the 5 o'clock hour for our kids to swim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=5171)|
| 1:26:13| Thank you so much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=5173)|
| 1:26:16| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=5176)|
| 1:26:18| Okay, Council, that is the end of public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=5178)|
| 1:26:20| and there's no other business, so we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160621?start=5180)|
