| 0:04:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=240)|
| 0:04:01| A lot of you all were there Friday night when we officially opened the holiday season in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=241)|
| 0:04:05| with the lighting of the Christmas tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=245)|
| 0:04:07| I don't know how many people were downtown, but whatever it is, it was a new record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=247)|
| 0:04:10| In the opening of the ice rink, there was a great crowd of people, and I appreciate everybody's helping that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=250)|
| 0:04:15| This week, first Friday, we're going to keep the momentum going with the WIVK Fowler's Christmas Parade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=255)|
| 0:04:20| It starts at 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=260)|
| 0:04:21| Floats, high school bands, dancers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=261)|
| 0:04:24| The Grand Marshal is dancing with the star, star, and country singer, Julianne Huff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=264)|
| 0:04:29| And we're also expecting an appearance by a big, fat guy in a red suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=269)|
| 0:04:33| Everyone is invited to a party in the 100 block of Gay Street following the parade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=273)|
| 0:04:38| The parade, for the first time this year, will be going through the old city, which we're looking forward to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=278)|
| 0:04:43| And then afterwards, there's a big block party on the 100 block of Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=283)|
| 0:04:47| I also want to announce that the city's Parks and Rec Department received two awards at the Tennessee Recreation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=287)|
| 0:04:51| and Parks Association Conference in Memphis last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=291)|
| 0:04:54| The first is the best new facility in the state for the Knoxville Skate Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=294)|
| 0:04:58| And that's a big honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=298)|
| 0:05:00| And it reflects that was a true community effort between city and a lot of volunteers out in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=300)|
| 0:05:07| And really, it really was a great picture of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=307)|
| 0:05:09| It took us a little while to get it done, but now it's done and getting great use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=309)|
| 0:05:12| So we're voting best new facility in the state for the skate park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=312)|
| 0:05:15| And Brian Beauchene, who I think is here with Beauchene, who I think is here with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=315)|
| 0:05:23| was recognized for the coveted four-star individual service award, recognizing his volunteer work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=323)|
| 0:05:29| A lot of you all remember he was the lead lobbyist for the cause, Brian was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=329)|
| 0:05:33| And since that, he's been kind of the lead representative and park organizer on behalf of the Knoxville Skate Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=333)|
| 0:05:39| And I think his heart and soul was a lot of what made this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=339)|
| 0:05:43| And so, Brian, I hope you're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=343)|
| 0:05:45| I think there was a rumor you were going to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=345)|
| 0:05:46| Brian, if you'll come up and accept this on behalf of the city, we really appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=346)|
| 0:05:50| We want to congratulate you and thank you for helping make this happen in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=350)|
| 0:05:54| Brian said it only took him 19 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=354)|
| 0:06:13| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=373)|
| 0:06:14| Nineteen years, but it was well worth it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=374)|
| 0:06:16| We appreciate everything you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=376)|
| 0:06:19| It is a great skate park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=379)|
| 0:06:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=381)|
| 0:06:22| That's all we have in Mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=382)|
| 0:06:25| We'll move on to reports of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=385)|
| 0:06:28| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=388)|
| 0:06:29| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=389)|
| 0:06:30| Three quick things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=390)|
| 0:06:31| First, I just need to remind folks and announce that there is an audit committee meeting two weeks from today on the 16th at 430.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=391)|
| 0:06:40| We should have the draft audit from the auditors, and we'll have food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=400)|
| 0:06:45| I think we'll get lunch box stuff, so we'll have audit and then beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=405)|
| 0:06:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=411)|
| 0:06:52| I'm sorry, beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=412)|
| 0:06:53| I'm sorry, beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=413)|
| 0:06:56| Audit committee, beer board, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=416)|
| 0:06:59| So that's one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=419)|
| 0:07:00| Second, I feel really bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=420)|
| 0:07:03| I have chosen for this meeting not to get a packet, and our website is down, so I cannot access the material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=423)|
| 0:07:10| So if at any point there's a particularly tough question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=430)|
| 0:07:13| I'm going to have to be leaning over to my colleagues to read things and apologize for that or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=433)|
| 0:07:20| And finally, I need to apologize for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=440)|
| 0:07:22| Two weeks ago, I had a little breakdown here at council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=442)|
| 0:07:24| And this council administration has always been very professional, very civil, even when we disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=444)|
| 0:07:31| And I totally lost my temper at the last meeting, and I apologize to all of you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=451)|
| 0:07:36| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=456)|
| 0:07:37| And I'd love to say it won't happen again, but I can say if it ever does happen, the large men on either side are empowered to hit me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=457)|
| 0:07:43| Thanks, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=463)|
| 0:07:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=466)|
| 0:07:47| Other reports of council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=467)|
| 0:07:48| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=468)|
| 0:07:49| Well, I would just comment that I happen to know that the little man in the red suit is going to be hanging around over the weekend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=469)|
| 0:07:57| because he is going to be at West Hills Park on Monday, the – what is that, the 8th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=477)|
| 0:08:03| And he is going to be there to hear some Christmas caroling by the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=483)|
| 0:08:07| and see the little West Hills Christmas tree, neighborhood Christmas tree, lighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=487)|
| 0:08:12| So we would welcome anyone who wants to come and celebrate the beginning of the holiday season with West Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=492)|

| 0:08:21| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=501)|
| 0:08:22| I would say as a point of clarification, under mayor's report, I do not own a red suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=502)|
| 0:08:29| Some people are touchy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=509)|

| 0:08:36| Just a reminder, I know council knows this for the public, on December 11th at 5 p.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=516)|
| 0:08:42| I believe in the small assembly room next door there is going to be a joint workshop of city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=522)|
| 0:08:48| and county commission on issues related to the 10-year plan to end chronic homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=528)|

| 0:10:58| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=658)|
| 0:10:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=659)|
| 0:11:00| At this point in the agenda, I respectfully request to move Item 11Q to this point before 10A is considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=660)|

| 0:11:09| Moved and seconded to move 11Q to the head of the agenda and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=669)|

| 0:11:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=677)|
| 0:11:18| 11Q, please, Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=678)|
| 0:11:19| 11Q is a resolution authorizing the city to construct a permanent monument sign and median strip at the intersection of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=679)|
| 0:11:27| Gibbs Drive and Broadway at a cost not to exceed $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=687)|
| 0:11:31| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=691)|
| 0:11:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=692)|
| 0:11:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=693)|
| 0:11:34| Let me just do a little background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=694)|
| 0:11:35| I think everybody knows we've been working on this situation for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=695)|
| 0:11:38| I think both Kroger and the neighborhood, everybody said we'd love to see this happen, and we've been working toward having that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=698)|
| 0:11:48| And last night, after a lot of conversations, we were able to meet with the neighborhood and the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=708)|
| 0:11:53| and Councilman Frost was there as well, and come to the agreement, which I think is what you have before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=713)|
| 0:12:00| I'll just put in a quick little editorial plug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=720)|
| 0:12:03| I personally think this is a great resolution to a very hard situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=723)|
| 0:12:06| The neighborhood is agreeing to drop their appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=726)|
| 0:12:11| They're also putting some limits on themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=731)|
| 0:12:13| They can no longer come out of Gibbs Drive and turn left on Broadway, so there's some inconvenience involved for them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=733)|
| 0:12:19| But on the flip side, I think they're protecting their neighborhood, I think, forever in terms of cut-through traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=739)|
| 0:12:25| and the situation with having a new Kroger store there is going to be solved, which I think is a great long-term use of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=745)|
| 0:12:32| So I don't normally lobby at the first part of a motion, but I did think it was important to kind of update that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=752)|
| 0:12:40| and Councilman Frost, I don't know if you want to add anything to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=760)|
| 0:12:42| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=762)|
| 0:12:44| I just wanted to, you know, thank the folks who were involved in getting to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=764)|
| 0:12:51| You can't say enough good things about, you know, particularly the residents on Gibbs Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=771)|
| 0:12:59| who all along just, you know, wanted the Krogers to go in and likewise wanted to be left alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=779)|
| 0:13:06| And, you know, this is something that the neighborhood has met on and thoughtfully and duly considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=786)|
| 0:13:14| You know, they understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=794)|
| 0:13:17| Their belief is that this is going to be a permanent fixation that will be not just a point of beauty for the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=797)|
| 0:13:28| but more importantly a point of traffic impediment, for lack of a better term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=808)|
| 0:13:37| to protect them from the anticipated traffic that's going to be generated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=817)|
| 0:13:46| In terms of the city's estimations on the increased revenue that the city will receive from a new larger Krogers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=826)|
| 0:13:59| this is easily offset in the first year of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=839)|
| 0:14:08| So, you know, we're looking forward to having this done and everybody putting this behind them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=848)|
| 0:14:14| and getting a new Krogers built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=854)|
| 0:14:17| Other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=857)|
| 0:14:19| I think, and I don't know if anybody wants to speak, I think the understanding is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=859)|
| 0:14:27| just so everybody's clear, that the appeal filed would be dropped upon the passing of 11Q.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=867)|
| 0:14:34| Is that, am I correct in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=874)|
| 0:14:36| I think I don't want to put, I want to make certain that we're all clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=876)|
| 0:14:39| And Paul, I guess, is speaking for the, Paul Dickinson is speaking for the neighborhood and is nodding yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=879)|
| 0:14:44| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=884)|
| 0:14:45| We've labored over this long and hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=885)|
| 0:14:46| I know people have come, but we don't need to labor over it more if people are ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=886)|
| 0:14:49| So, any questions anybody wants to ask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=889)|
| 0:14:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=893)|
| 0:14:54| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=894)|
| 0:14:55| Are we confident that the $50,000 will cover the entire cost of constructing these improvements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=895)|
| 0:15:01| Yeah, I think I'll let, if Steve King wants to comment, but we've had lots of discussions about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=901)|
| 0:15:07| We feel good about this in terms of we can do it for that amount or less, quite frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=907)|
| 0:15:12| We feel good about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=912)|
| 0:15:14| Steve, I think that we, your resolution says $50,000 or less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=914)|
| 0:15:18| and we feel very comfortable that within that we can come up with something that looks great and protects their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=918)|
| 0:15:25| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=925)|
| 0:15:26| Steve, you want to comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=926)|
| 0:15:27| I was just going to say, Mayor, that we did estimate the cost of the construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=927)|
| 0:15:31| and included an allotment for the monument sign that we feel like we can accomplish the work as shown in the drawing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=931)|
| 0:15:38| including the landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=938)|
| 0:15:40| And you're confident there aren't any utility issues or anything like that that might crop up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=940)|
| 0:15:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=944)|
| 0:15:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=946)|
| 0:15:47| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=947)|
| 0:15:48| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=948)|
| 0:15:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=949)|
| 0:15:50| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=950)|
| 0:15:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=951)|
| 0:15:52| Opposed, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=952)|
| 0:15:53| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=953)|
| 0:15:54| Let me just stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=954)|
| 0:15:55| And I want to thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=955)|
| 0:15:56| This has been a fairly long process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=956)|
| 0:15:57| Lots of people have been involved from the neighborhood, from Kroger's been up here innumerable times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=957)|
| 0:16:03| from other people within Fountain City who had an interest in seeing this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=963)|
| 0:16:06| And I want to take my hat off and thank everybody involved in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=966)|
| 0:16:10| You did a great job of, I think, coming to what Ms. Pelow, when she suggested this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=970)|
| 0:16:14| that she was looking for a win, win, win, win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=974)|
| 0:16:16| Did I get four of them in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=976)|
| 0:16:17| And I think we succeeded in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| So, thank you all very much for all of your efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=979)|
| 0:16:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=982)|

| 0:16:35| 10A is still on the agenda, so how do we need to handle it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=995)|
| 0:16:41| Motion to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1001)|
| 0:16:42| We'll need a motion to withdraw 10A and 11H, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1002)|
| 0:16:46| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1006)|

| 0:20:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1234)|
| 0:20:36| Could you give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1236)|
| 0:20:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1239)|
| 0:20:40| My name is Reverend William Pace of Martin Chapel, 1746 Ohio Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1240)|
| 0:20:46| Thank you very much, mayor, and to the city council and to my colleagues who came with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1246)|
| 0:20:52| me this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1252)|
| 0:20:56| Some time ago, as Councilman Becker said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1256)|
| 0:21:01| people from the architecture office came out and showed us the design of an improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1261)|
| 0:21:08| on the recreation facility that was already there in Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1268)|
| 0:21:12| And we looked at that, and we felt and know for certainty that it's not adequate for the needs of our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1272)|
| 0:21:20| and for our young people that are coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1280)|
| 0:21:23| And so what we've asked them to do, please, is to take the monies and set it aside as seed money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1283)|
| 0:21:29| being that we are a people of faith and knowing that you have our best interests at heart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1289)|
| 0:21:34| and for the goodwill of this community, that you would look into whatever coffers that you might have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1294)|
| 0:21:41| and maybe revisit the monies that were allocated for the empowerment zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1301)|
| 0:21:46| and to see exactly what has happened to the monies that were to be done for our recreation center in our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1306)|
| 0:21:53| There has been numerous and new buildings that have gone up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1313)|
| 0:21:56| As a matter of fact, I think I met you back in the summertime, Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1316)|
| 0:21:59| and it was mentioned to you then that they had torn down a recreation facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1319)|
| 0:22:04| and none had been put or had been replaced at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1324)|
| 0:22:09| And in order for us to be able to do and to get a scope on what it is that we're working with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1329)|
| 0:22:13| we need to know that the center here that we're talking about serves at least three communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1333)|
| 0:22:19| one of not only Lonsdale, but Mechanicsville and Beaumont and Western Heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1339)|
| 0:22:26| And there are Boys and Girls Club and some locales throughout this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1346)|
| 0:22:32| but those costs that are associated with the Boys and Girls Club are prohibitive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1352)|
| 0:22:37| for persons who are on moderate incomes and have budgeted certain amounts of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1357)|
| 0:22:43| And we need a place for our young people to be able to come after school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1363)|
| 0:22:47| and to upgrade the growing population that's in Lonsdale and that area of community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1367)|
| 0:22:54| so that you might be able to better access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1374)|
| 0:22:58| that we might be able to better access the validity of what our young people are supposed to be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1378)|
| 0:23:05| Right now we have several programs that come in in the afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1385)|
| 0:23:10| And when they get there, such as the Youth Center for CCYS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1390)|
| 0:23:20| which is the City Center Youth Sports Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1400)|
| 0:23:28| Then you have the Rural Christian Academy that comes and uses a facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1408)|
| 0:23:33| And understand this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1413)|
| 0:23:34| Now, this facility was built back in 1960, as I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1414)|
| 0:23:41| It may be earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1421)|
| 0:23:42| It's a little box community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1422)|
| 0:23:44| You cannot use it if you wanted to run a professional basketball game or a tournament in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1424)|
| 0:23:50| It's not regulation size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1430)|
| 0:23:52| There is not enough space and there are not enough certain areas that people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1432)|
| 0:24:00| young kids want to play with their video games| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| and the other things that we have, ping pong tables,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1443)|
| 0:24:06| that they're sitting over in the side of the other facility because there's just not enough space there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1446)|
| 0:24:11| And what we know for a fact is that the design that was presented to us is not adequate for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1451)|
| 0:24:20| And we beseech you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1460)|
| 0:24:24| How can I say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| And we recognize that Councilman Becker has done a wonderful job for us, but he's not going to be running,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1466)|
| 0:24:31| so we're going to have to probably get somebody down here that's going to be really looking out for our interests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1471)|
| 0:24:37| And I think that we can muster together the right kind of votes to do what we have to do to have this voice known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1477)|
| 0:24:44| And understand, this is not a play on words, and we're not looking at this from a point of benign neglect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1484)|
| 0:24:52| although I do feel that's exactly what has happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1492)|
| 0:24:55| Because when this center was first built, the people in that community who is serving it now could not even go to that particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1495)|
| 0:25:02| That's why they call it the White Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1502)|
| 0:25:04| They couldn't even go to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1504)|
| 0:25:05| So now that they have gone to other areas of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1505)|
| 0:25:10| there has not been any pointed improvement in the educational and the recreational objectives of our community, even in our school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1510)|
| 0:25:21| Now, we've looked at certain things, and we've even talked about that there may be in the Sam Hill Community School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1521)|
| 0:25:28| maybe there could be something done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1528)|
| 0:25:30| And towards that, being that they've turned that school down because there's a big enough facility there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1530)|
| 0:25:35| but we'd have to have your wholehearted commitment towards making this a viable area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1535)|
| 0:25:40| because we recognize even with the moving in of Cisco and with the steel mill Amistel that's right down the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1540)|
| 0:25:47| other things are going to be going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1547)|
| 0:25:49| And we feel like the vital re-infrastructure that's going to be going on with the new administration from the national level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1549)|
| 0:25:56| that's coming on board, that we want to be a part of the growth and the future of Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1556)|
| 0:26:02| Thank you, Reverend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1562)|
| 0:26:04| Len Clemmons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1564)|
| 0:26:09| Len, if you could give us your name and address, and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1569)|
| 0:26:12| Len Clemmons, Sr., 3334 Gap Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1572)|
| 0:26:16| What I want to do, I just wanted to offer you and tell you that I have a petition from five, six churches in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1576)|
| 0:26:22| They signed to go along with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1582)|
| 0:26:24| And I would like to yield my time to Mr. Rodney Shell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1584)|
| 0:26:29| He's a coach at that area down at that school and up at that center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1589)|
| 0:26:33| and he knows a lot more about what kind of crowd they have than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1593)|
| 0:26:36| So I would like to yield my time to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1596)|
| 0:26:39| That would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1599)|
| 0:26:40| You've got four more minutes, Coach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| My name is Rodney Shell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1604)|
| 0:26:45| I live at 1750 Connecticut Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1605)|
| 0:26:48| Graduated Fulton High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1608)|
| 0:26:50| I attended Mercer University and also played at Knoxville College.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1610)|
| 0:26:54| I've been coaching in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1614)|
| 0:26:56| I know some people on this stand here for many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1616)|
| 0:27:01| and my kids are always at a disadvantage because we have nowhere to go and nowhere to practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1621)|
| 0:27:06| We're losing all our kids to all the other teams because they have better facilities than us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1626)|
| 0:27:13| We need a room for tutors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| We need teachers to teach our kids, not only basketball courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1635)|
| 0:27:20| We need a basketball court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1640)|
| 0:27:21| We need a kitchen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| We need a meeting room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1643)|
| 0:27:24| We just don't need just one little building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| We have black kids, white kids, Mexican kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1647)|
| 0:27:31| We have all kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1651)|
| 0:27:33| We have elderly people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1653)|
| 0:27:34| We need something for the elderly people, a walking track, like they have at Big Dash Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1654)|
| 0:27:42| We need all these kind of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1664)|
| 0:27:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1665)|
| 0:27:46| Mrs. Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1666)|
| 0:27:58| My name is Margaret Lee, and I live at 2017 Minnesota Avenue in Lonsdale Homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1678)|
| 0:28:06| I have a concern for the children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1686)|
| 0:28:09| They don't have a place to play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1689)|
| 0:28:11| It's my understanding that there's five developments that has to use that one center down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1691)|
| 0:28:19| Where I live, there's a big parking lot in the back, and the children are playing in the parking lot and all in the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1699)|
| 0:28:24| And I've seen all kinds of near misses with accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1704)|
| 0:28:28| I don't want to see any of those children get hurt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1708)|
| 0:28:31| We have other issues out there in Lonsdale Homes that I will not discuss tonight because it's not on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1711)|
| 0:28:36| But I'm asking for help that we get a better facility for those kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1716)|
| 0:28:44| There's little bitty children that can't walk from our development down to Stonewall because there's no sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1724)|
| 0:28:52| So I have a concern for not only for the children but for everybody else in that surrounding neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1732)|
| 0:29:01| And that's why I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1741)|
| 0:29:02| I'm asking that you all would consider giving us some kind of help over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1742)|
| 0:29:07| I've been in Lonsdale Homes for 51 years in that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1747)|
| 0:29:11| And like I say, the neighborhood's growing all around, and there are more kids now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1751)|
| 0:29:17| So that's why I'm here to see if you all can give us some kind of help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1757)|
| 0:29:22| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1762)|
| 0:29:25| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1765)|
| 0:29:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1767)|
| 0:29:29| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1769)|
| 0:29:30| Yeah, I guess I'll just say, I mean, I think it's a great situation when folks from the community come up and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1770)|
| 0:29:36| we want the city to be helping us make this a better neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1776)|
| 0:29:40| And I kind of wanted to, and I know the Vice Mayor's got a comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| but I wanted to just since to take a minute or two and just get some ideas from folks here on council about how to move forward on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1782)|
| 0:29:51| ways we can help folks in Lonsdale get the kind of recreation facilities they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1791)|
| 0:29:57| and just ask council for their input on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1797)|
| 0:30:01| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1801)|
| 0:30:05| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1805)|
| 0:30:06| I guess before we get into that, I just wanted to make sure I'm clear on a couple of things here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1806)|
| 0:30:11| Does anybody have any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1811)|
| 0:30:13| Well, first, let me start with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| With regards to deferring this process and setting this money aside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1815)|
| 0:30:19| is there a firm commitment from the administration that this money will be set aside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1819)|
| 0:30:24| and only used for whatever new plan we come along with for Lonsdale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1824)|
| 0:30:28| The problem I see is with the next question is going to be timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1828)|
| 0:30:33| Now, we do a new budget in June or July, and the way things are tight right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1833)|
| 0:30:37| I want to make sure first off that this money is going to be set aside for this purpose out there as we do this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1837)|
| 0:30:43| So is the administration joining in this resolution going to commit to keeping those monies set aside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1843)|
| 0:30:49| for the Lonsdale Recreation Facility or towards one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1849)|
| 0:30:55| Sam, you want to comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1855)|
| 0:30:57| Well, half the money is KCDC's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1857)|
| 0:31:00| The other half is the city's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1860)|
| 0:31:02| But as far as the commitment from the city money, once money is put into capital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1862)|
| 0:31:06| it generally stays there unless the council reappropriates it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1866)|
| 0:31:11| But the half that's KCDC's money, I can't answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1871)|
| 0:31:17| Is there anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1877)|
| 0:31:18| Have you spoke to KCDC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| Don Peterson is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1880)|
| 0:31:23| Don, could you come forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| And what I'm kind of getting to is, you know, this community is basically saying, hey, we want to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1885)|
| 0:31:31| We want something better and more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| This is going to actually deliver the recreation facilities we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1893)|
| 0:31:36| And my concern is this money is now set aside, and we all know how capital projects are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1896)|
| 0:31:40| We have them sitting on the books that some never get funded and some do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| And those monies start moving around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| And contrary to what the public believes, sometimes those monies are fungible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1905)|
| 0:31:49| and sometimes those monies are amorphous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1909)|
| 0:31:52| They kind of move, and you try to get your hands around them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| and they kind of move and dissipate from time to time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1914)|
| 0:31:56| So I want to make sure, first off, that we're all clear that this is going to be set aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1916)|
| 0:32:00| What about KCDC's commitment, Don?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| KCDC is committed to it, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| And Don Peterson, KCDC, 901 Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1924)|
| 0:32:07| Good, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1927)|
| 0:32:08| I guess then the next thing is, with regards to I would think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1928)|
| 0:32:13| some sort of task force put together with the neighborhood, city parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1933)|
| 0:32:18| and I guess someone from the administration other than just out of parks that could sit down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1938)|
| 0:32:23| and have a discussion not only about what is an appropriate facility out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1943)|
| 0:32:27| but also the financial end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1947)|
| 0:32:30| That needs to happen very quickly, especially as we go into a budget for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1950)|
| 0:32:35| And those are my comments right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1955)|
| 0:32:37| but I wanted to make sure we were all clear that I heard that KCD is committed to leaving their money in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1957)|
| 0:32:42| and Sam, the administration, is committed to leaving their portion in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| So we know we've got that baseline money there and will be there once they come through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1965)|
| 0:32:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1970)|
| 0:32:51| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1971)|
| 0:32:52| I'd like to ask Mr. Walsh a few questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1972)|
| 0:33:03| I had a conversation with Mr. Walsh this afternoon about this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1983)|
| 0:33:06| and just want to understand a little more about, since I've not been to the center myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1986)|
| 0:33:12| what facilities are available now and what the intent was of the city when these monies were appropriated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1992)|
| 0:33:18| in terms of the scope of the improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=1998)|
| 0:33:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2001)|
| 0:33:22| We've got 16 recreation centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| Seven of them are of the same size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| I think Mr. Pace mentioned they were built in 1960, 1958, 1959, 1960.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2006)|
| 0:33:32| There were seven of them built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2012)|
| 0:33:33| They're all the same size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2013)|
| 0:33:34| And Lonsdale is one of those, along with Inskip, Alice Bell, New Hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2014)|
| 0:33:40| There's three or four others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2020)|
| 0:33:41| But it's a small gymnasium for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2021)|
| 0:33:44| It's not a full size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2024)|
| 0:33:45| We've got seven or eight gymnasiums within, you know, Christenbury, Dean Hill, Milton Roberts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2025)|
| 0:33:51| and East Hospital, E.V. Davidson that are full-size gymnasiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2031)|
| 0:33:54| But this is a fairly small facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2034)|
| 0:33:56| It's got a gymnasium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2036)|
| 0:33:57| It's got a craft room, and then it's got restrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2037)|
| 0:34:00| And that's basically what we're working with right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2040)|
| 0:34:04| When Lonsdale Homes facility was taken out as part of the redevelopment for Lonsdale Homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2044)|
| 0:34:10| I think KCDC agreed that they would help partner with us to make some improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2050)|
| 0:34:16| And initially our thoughts of, with a budget of about $350,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2056)|
| 0:34:21| was to make some improvements as an additional multipurpose room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2061)|
| 0:34:25| add-on to this facility to make it more usable and neighborhood friendly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2065)|
| 0:34:31| where you'd be able to do exercise classes, host senior events, have church potluck dinners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2071)|
| 0:34:39| those type of activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2079)|
| 0:34:40| We built a similar addition onto Dean Hill Recreation Centre about ten years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2080)|
| 0:34:45| and it's been a real successful facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2085)|
| 0:34:47| And we were using that basically as a model for what we were looking at doing at Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2087)|
| 0:34:51| In fact, we'd already hired an architect who's now under contract with the city to do the design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2091)|
| 0:34:58| But before we really got started, we wanted to have the public meeting in Lonsdale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2098)|
| 0:35:02| which we did to get some feedback from the neighborhood as far as what they wanted to see happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2102)|
| 0:35:07| And that's where we are now with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2107)|
| 0:35:10| Long range within Parks and Recreation with us having seven facilities in our inventory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2110)|
| 0:35:17| that are similar to this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2117)|
| 0:35:19| I assume all seven are similar in size and scope to the one that's currently in Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2119)|
| 0:35:25| Is it our plan to try to improve all seven of these in the same manner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2125)|
| 0:35:29| This would be our first attempt to do any kind of addition onto a recreational facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2129)|
| 0:35:35| I would hope if this process went successful, we'd use it as a model, hopefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2135)|
| 0:35:39| and be able to continue that process because obviously when you're looking at 50-year-old facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2139)|
| 0:35:43| it's probably time to do some updating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2143)|
| 0:35:47| But in this case, with the current proposal, the current budget of $350,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2147)|
| 0:35:53| nearly half of that has come from funding from KCDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2153)|
| 0:35:57| whereas with improvements to other centers around the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2157)|
| 0:36:00| we probably wouldn't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| KCDC wouldn't have the means or the incentive to give that contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2162)|
| 0:36:05| Is that a correct assessment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| That's correct. That's all I'll say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| And I visited with Mr. Clemens a little bit before the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2169)|
| 0:36:12| and my concern going forward is that I think we are all hearing in this economy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2172)|
| 0:36:17| that the resources that the city is going to have available are going to be lesser, not greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2177)|
| 0:36:23| And I kind of feel like a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2183)|
| 0:36:28| And I am concerned about postponing some great improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2188)|
| 0:36:33| or setting aside some monies when there might be some things that we could do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2193)|
| 0:36:38| to make this center better for folks to use right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| I think the public input process is very important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2201)|
| 0:36:44| and maybe the improvements that the architect drew out aren't what the community needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2204)|
| 0:36:49| but maybe within that budget, with some community improvement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2209)|
| 0:36:52| we could find something that met more folks' needs and get something done now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2212)|
| 0:36:57| I'm concerned that, you know, this budget includes money from KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2217)|
| 0:37:02| We've got six other centers besides this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2222)|
| 0:37:05| that may be lining up for improvements in their neighborhood as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2225)|
| 0:37:08| and we don't have a contribution from a third party or a second party, I guess, to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2228)|
| 0:37:13| So I'm just really concerned about folks not getting something now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2233)|
| 0:37:18| As I said, it's that old bird in the hand thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2238)|
| 0:37:21| I just think that some improvements now, while the money is available, might be prudent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2241)|
| 0:37:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2248)|
| 0:37:29| I'm going to go to Councilwoman Pelo next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2249)|
| 0:37:32| Mr. Walsh, just hang in there a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2252)|
| 0:37:35| And, Don, if you don't mind coming back up, because Ms. Roddy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2255)|
| 0:37:40| a couple of her comments caused me to want to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2260)|
| 0:37:46| The question is, Madam, would you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2266)|
| 0:37:48| Excuse me, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2268)|
| 0:37:49| Excuse me, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2269)|
| 0:37:50| We need to stay within the protocol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2273)|
| 0:37:54| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2274)|
| 0:37:55| I think Mr. Peterson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2275)|
| 0:37:56| Mr. Peterson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2276)|
| 0:37:57| Don.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2277)|
| 0:37:58| Don.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2278)|
| 0:37:59| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2279)|
| 0:38:00| He's just Don to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2280)|
| 0:38:01| Mr. Peterson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2281)|
| 0:38:02| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2282)|
| 0:38:03| Ms. Roddy has commented about the money might not be available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2283)|
| 0:38:06| but now you are telling us that for a period of postponement where this can be looked at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2286)|
| 0:38:11| the funds that were appropriated for this purpose would still be held in escrow, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2291)|
| 0:38:17| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| Let me ask you if you have available grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2299)|
| 0:38:23| or other funds that would look to answer some of the questions Ms. Roddy has asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2303)|
| 0:38:29| At the time, no, ma'am, we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| But, you know, we will offer assistance to help look at other areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2311)|
| 0:38:34| and we will help you in that aspect and partner with the city as much as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2314)|
| 0:38:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2319)|
| 0:38:40| I just thought everybody might like an answer to that question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2320)|
| 0:38:43| which is just kind of hanging out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| And, Mr. Walsh, it seems to me that one of the issues here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2325)|
| 0:38:49| because we have a similar situation down in my district that we've discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2329)|
| 0:38:54| where we have the facility, but we don't have a program going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2334)|
| 0:38:58| and the facility has a lot of needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2338)|
| 0:39:01| I'm thinking that this is going to require a lot of creative thinking, as far as I'm concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2341)|
| 0:39:09| in terms of personnel, in terms of security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2349)|
| 0:39:13| in terms of some other issues that happen when you expand a facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2353)|
| 0:39:17| Do you care to comment any about how you were thinking that you would be able to staff a facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2357)|
| 0:39:25| that is perhaps larger and offers more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2365)|
| 0:39:29| Well, I think what we had in mind when we did this addition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2369)|
| 0:39:32| fortunately, when they closed the one recreation center over in Lonsdale Homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2372)|
| 0:39:36| we were able to shift that individual who worked there over to the Lonsdale Stonewall facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2376)|
| 0:39:40| So we had two individuals working there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| So we felt like an addition onto the existing Lonsdale Recreation Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2382)|
| 0:39:46| we would be able to continue to program it and staff it adequately with our existing staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2386)|
| 0:39:51| Now, if we were to make it much larger or build a new facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2391)|
| 0:39:55| then you've got a whole different set of issues involving new positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2395)|
| 0:40:00| We're very proud of our program that we have done at Lonsdale Stonewall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2400)|
| 0:40:05| It is just a facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2405)|
| 0:40:07| There are limitations, but still, we're very creative in our programming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2407)|
| 0:40:10| and have a very good after-school program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| and we facilitate programs with adults and with senior citizens there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2412)|
| 0:40:19| Well, I'm just going to sort of think on my seat here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2419)|
| 0:40:24| but it seems to me that I can understand the community feeling that it's a good decision to postpone a decision on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2424)|
| 0:40:34| to give an opportunity to explore ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2434)|
| 0:40:38| But I think one, and frankly, I'm in favor of postponing a decision on it tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2438)|
| 0:40:45| in order for the opportunity to look at that, both by the community, by the city administration, and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2445)|
| 0:40:53| But it seems to me that whatever that task force, I believe it was the mayor maybe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2453)|
| 0:40:59| were you the one who used the term task force?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2459)|
| 0:41:02| No, I think it was the vice mayor who might have said task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2462)|
| 0:41:06| And I think that's just going to be very, very important here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2466)|
| 0:41:10| but it seems to me that we're going to need some community partners to be able to make something of this nature happen there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2470)|
| 0:41:22| and at these other centers as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2482)|
| 0:41:25| So it seems to me that the way that task force is comprised is going to be very, very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2485)|
| 0:41:33| I think it's, of course, important for the neighborhood leaders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2493)|
| 0:41:38| and those who work with the young people now, the coach, others, to be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2498)|
| 0:41:45| But I think it's also important to look outside the neighborhood to perhaps some organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2505)|
| 0:41:52| that can be of some support in having the desired programs and supervision for the kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2512)|
| 0:42:00| I have no idea what those organizations are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2520)|
| 0:42:03| except I know there are organizations that are just wonderful at finding volunteers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2523)|
| 0:42:08| and finding people who are looking for opportunities to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2528)|
| 0:42:13| And, you know, I'm thinking of the Compassion Coalition, some of the other organizations that do a great deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2533)|
| 0:42:19| So I would encourage this to be a very well thought out task force with a time frame in which it needs to operate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2539)|
| 0:42:30| because spring is going to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2550)|
| 0:42:32| Everybody is going to be very anxious for these kids to have facilities and opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2552)|
| 0:42:37| And here again, we have been reminded by Ms. Roddy about the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2557)|
| 0:42:42| So in looking at all that, you know, it's the end of December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2562)|
| 0:42:47| and the budget is going to be formulated here soon and nickels are hard to find these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2567)|
| 0:42:54| So I just would like to know how we're going to commit to get something done where these funds don't, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2574)|
| 0:43:03| it may be a dollar today, but that dollar may be 80 cents in another six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2583)|
| 0:43:08| So I would really like for this to be a kind of an expedited look and see and not just an open-ended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2588)|
| 0:43:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2597)|
| 0:43:18| Councilman Whitehall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2600)|
| 0:43:22| I can't afford not to support the neighborhood in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2602)|
| 0:43:25| I would encourage you to go check that, go look at this center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2605)|
| 0:43:29| It's about the size of the small assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| It's tiny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2611)|
| 0:43:32| And there are a lot of young people, probably more young people there than maybe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2612)|
| 0:43:40| I don't know what the demographics are, how many more young people the centers are attempting to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2620)|
| 0:43:47| with that one small center and closing off the one that was on KCDC property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2627)|
| 0:43:54| But to answer your question, Councilman Becker, I don't know what the process is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2634)|
| 0:44:00| but I think that we need to stand behind the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2640)|
| 0:44:03| We need to perhaps form a public process the way the Vice Mayor suggested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2643)|
| 0:44:09| and get some kind of a sense of what the needs are in the community for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2649)|
| 0:44:18| You know, and I would love to help out in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2658)|
| 0:44:20| I think that's the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2660)|
| 0:44:23| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2663)|
| 0:44:26| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2666)|
| 0:44:28| Do we even know what we were going to do with these funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2668)|
| 0:44:32| Joe, you want to comment on what was going to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2672)|
| 0:44:34| Is there a plan that we know we don't want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2674)|
| 0:44:37| What we did, we had the architect go out to Dean Hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2677)|
| 0:44:40| and take some photographs of the addition we did out there ten years ago, Councilman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2680)|
| 0:44:45| and basically it's a large multipurpose, about 4,500 square foot facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2685)|
| 0:44:49| that was added on to the Dean Hill Recreation Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2689)|
| 0:44:52| And we were basically using that as a model to start with to sort of going that as square one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2692)|
| 0:44:58| And that was our thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2700)|
| 0:45:01| I heard some of the items mentioned earlier, kitchen, you know, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2701)|
| 0:45:08| I heard some of those things, a walking track and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2708)|
| 0:45:11| And when was Dean Hill expanded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2711)|
| 0:45:14| It was 1998.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2714)|
| 0:45:17| What did that cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| It was about half a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2719)|
| 0:45:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2721)|
| 0:45:22| But that also included the room that's utilized only by one group, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2722)|
| 0:45:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2729)|
| 0:45:30| And that takes that room to the off the bridge club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2732)|
| 0:45:33| And that's with a very, they think it's a hefty fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2733)|
| 0:45:36| Mayor, I don't really see any harm in some sort of postponement for a little while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2736)|
| 0:45:41| because the dollar does go down every day you wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2741)|
| 0:45:44| You know, this $400,000 or whatever won't be the same $400,000 next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2744)|
| 0:45:50| But I would like to see, you know, some sort of an estimate and a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2750)|
| 0:45:54| and talk to the community and see what they're interested in and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2754)|
| 0:45:58| and look at the money for next year and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2758)|
| 0:46:01| And how do you feel about it, Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2761)|
| 0:46:03| I hate to put you on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2763)|
| 0:46:04| I know you have your folks to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| No, I think it's fine to postpone and step back and take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2766)|
| 0:46:09| I think we have to, and back to Ms. Roddy's point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2769)|
| 0:46:12| we have to be realistic in terms of what we can do in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2772)|
| 0:46:15| But, and we also have to, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2775)|
| 0:46:17| we're trying real hard to balance things around each section of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2777)|
| 0:46:21| But I personally don't see if there's any harm in stepping back and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2781)|
| 0:46:25| how else could we do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| I think we have to say up front we don't have an unlimited pot of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| but we can step back and look, is my feeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2790)|
| 0:46:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2794)|
| 0:46:35| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2795)|
| 0:46:36| Yeah, I guess first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2796)|
| 0:46:37| Reverend Pace has been standing there for quite a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2797)|
| 0:46:40| And I know you had something to say 15 minutes ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2800)|
| 0:46:44| and just sort of ask you to share what you're thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2804)|
| 0:46:48| Thank you again, Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| And Ms. Roddy and to the others that are sitting with the Mayor, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2810)|
| 0:46:55| it kind of comes to mind that when you have a self-fulfilling prophecy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2815)|
| 0:47:00| about what the dollars are going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2820)|
| 0:47:03| you don't know what the future holds, but we know who holds the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2823)|
| 0:47:06| And so what we need to understand and to think is that if we step and do what is right here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2826)|
| 0:47:13| this is going to be an example not only for the Lonsdale community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2833)|
| 0:47:17| but for six or seven other facilities around Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2837)|
| 0:47:23| And if we put this thing in order just as it should be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2843)|
| 0:47:27| get the outside support that Councilwoman Pilati mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2847)|
| 0:47:33| and bring in some of the resources that we know that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2853)|
| 0:47:37| or have been allotted for certain things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2857)|
| 0:47:40| and reevaluate and reprioritize certain monies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2860)|
| 0:47:46| then we will see that we are investing in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2866)|
| 0:47:50| Other people will see that we are investing in Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2870)|
| 0:47:53| and they will come forth to do the things that have to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2873)|
| 0:47:56| And as far as fully staffing this type of institution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2876)|
| 0:48:00| there are people in our communities that I'm quite sure that will be willing to step up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2880)|
| 0:48:05| and volunteer and do certain types of services until such time as money is able to be drawn down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2885)|
| 0:48:11| to be able to fully staff it on a professional level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2891)|
| 0:48:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2895)|
| 0:48:16| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2896)|
| 0:48:17| I guess just a couple thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2897)|
| 0:48:21| One thing is I think while looking outside Lonsdale for resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2901)|
| 0:48:25| Lonsdale also has a lot of infrastructure itself, and it's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2905)|
| 0:48:29| Blair Trimble from Ameristeel is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2909)|
| 0:48:32| and I've already got sort of thinking about a task force of people to be on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2912)|
| 0:48:36| and I haven't actually written his name yet, but I'm sure I will later today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2916)|
| 0:48:41| And Cisco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2921)|
| 0:48:42| There's some strong infrastructure there that we can draw on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2922)|
| 0:48:45| There's also a lot of creativity, which is, I think, another word you used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2925)|
| 0:48:48| about how to think about this, how to better use the money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2928)|
| 0:48:51| some interesting ideas about ways to do this in conjunction with the school that get some good thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2931)|
| 0:48:58| that become a win-win-win, as you like to stress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2938)|
| 0:49:01| So that works a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2941)|
| 0:49:04| My sense is that a task force does make sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2944)|
| 0:49:07| and I heard Councilman Woodhull volunteer to help anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2947)|
| 0:49:11| and I guess to ask – I was going to ask Councilman Bailey if he could help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2951)|
| 0:49:14| I know he's got some tremendous assets on these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2954)|
| 0:49:17| but if there are other people who want to serve on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2957)|
| 0:49:20| and does it make sense for me to put together a draft resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2960)|
| 0:49:25| and share it with folks about who should be on this and sort of shepherd this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2965)|
| 0:49:28| run it through Mr. Swanson and get it out to folks and go that way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2968)|
| 0:49:32| Does that feel like a good next step?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2972)|
| 0:49:36| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2976)|
| 0:49:37| If I may say one other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2977)|
| 0:49:38| If I remember correctly, I think I was told as we look towards people who would help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2978)|
| 0:49:44| and assist us in this magnanimous attempt to right what has been wrong for so many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2984)|
| 0:49:52| Mr. Mayor, I believe that your mother helped donate towards that facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2992)|
| 0:49:58| a dean that they brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=2998)|
| 0:50:01| Yes, yes, sir, she did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3001)|
| 0:50:03| And we would certainly welcome her support, as we saw your father in the paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3003)|
| 0:50:08| you know, donating certain things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3008)|
| 0:50:11| So noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3011)|
| 0:50:14| It's amazing how memory will serve you at times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3014)|
| 0:50:17| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3017)|
| 0:50:18| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3018)|
| 0:50:19| I'm glad to hear that Councilman Woodhull is going to be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3019)|
| 0:50:24| He has just great tools when it comes to the public process and also the shared visioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3024)|
| 0:50:30| What I see here, I hope that very quickly, and we can't do it tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3030)|
| 0:50:35| that there is some quick shared visioning and shared expectations established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3035)|
| 0:50:39| You know, I sense what I think the community wants and expects without asking them that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3039)|
| 0:50:45| I think we all sense what they want and expect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3045)|
| 0:50:47| and there needs to be some very quick shared visioning with regards to what we can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3047)|
| 0:50:53| and some realistic expectations so we can make something happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3053)|
| 0:50:58| I, too, agree with the community here and what they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3058)|
| 0:51:01| Postponing and having this discussion is very beneficial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3061)|
| 0:51:05| I would hope that the process does not get so bogged down that one looks up a year from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3065)|
| 0:51:11| and I guess a year and two months from now, I won't be on this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3071)|
| 0:51:16| And a year and two months from now, or two years from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3076)|
| 0:51:19| someone finally says, here's what we want this to look like, and that money is not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3079)|
| 0:51:25| And that's a concern that I think I have, and there may not be certain people here on this council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3085)|
| 0:51:31| who are supportive now to be a whole different council come December of next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3091)|
| 0:51:35| We have five new people on this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3095)|
| 0:51:37| One of them will be from Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3097)|
| 0:51:39| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3099)|
| 0:51:40| Well, no, Mr. Becker will be on this council next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3100)|
| 0:51:42| He's got two more years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3102)|
| 0:51:43| Two more years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3103)|
| 0:51:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3104)|
| 0:51:45| He's got, I guess, two more years after this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3105)|
| 0:51:48| But my point is there also should be a very realistic timeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3108)|
| 0:51:52| and I'm glad to hear Councilman Woodall is going to be involved because he knows how to drive these processes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3112)|
| 0:51:56| and push things along so that we don't end up in a position where we once again have a great plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3116)|
| 0:52:05| but no resources to make it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3125)|
| 0:52:07| And I do think it is an excellent idea to get Cisco and Ameristeel involved here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3127)|
| 0:52:12| you know, those corporate giants that sit out there in Lonsdale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3132)|
| 0:52:16| and to talk to them about their corporate citizenry, as it were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3136)|
| 0:52:20| and their citizenship as it relates to participating in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3140)|
| 0:52:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3145)|
| 0:52:26| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3146)|
| 0:52:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3148)|
| 0:52:29| Joe, Sam, anything that we left out that you all want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3149)|
| 0:52:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3152)|
| 0:52:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3153)|
| 0:52:34| Mr. Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3154)|
| 0:52:35| We have a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3155)|
| 0:52:36| I think there was a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| There is a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3158)|
| 0:52:39| So no further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3159)|
| 0:52:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3160)|
| 0:52:41| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3161)|
| 0:52:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3162)|
| 0:52:43| Opposed, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3163)|
| 0:52:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3164)|
| 0:52:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3165)|
| 0:52:46| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3166)|
| 0:52:47| I'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3167)|
| 0:52:48| I don't know how long it will take with this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3168)|
| 0:52:50| but when we have our February, March, whatever time of the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3170)|
| 0:52:54| we have our kind of first discussion about the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3174)|
| 0:52:57| and the upcoming process that somewhere in that discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3177)|
| 0:53:01| someone kind of brings us up to speed on where we are with this process, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3181)|
| 0:53:05| and especially if we're looking towards the budget for next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3185)|
| 0:53:08| so that it continues to be something that we don't forget about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3188)|
| 0:53:11| So, you know, when we have those initial discussions, Mayor, about forecasting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3191)|
| 0:53:15| and maybe someone could just give us two or three minutes and say, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3195)|
| 0:53:18| with regards to the Lonsdale piece and that committee, this is where things stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3198)|
| 0:53:22| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3202)|
| 0:53:23| And I think the note is that, you know, we have taken these monies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3203)|
| 0:53:26| KCDC has done the same thing to set aside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3206)|
| 0:53:28| and then we have to look at additional monies like we do at every other additional request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3208)|
| 0:53:31| that we have at the city and everybody on council understands that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3211)|
| 0:53:34| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3214)|
| 0:53:35| I just want to make sure it stays in the forefront of individuals' minds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3215)|
| 0:53:38| so if we hear something three or four months from now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3218)|
| 0:53:40| and we start talking about our budget, get an update on it, that would be beneficial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3220)|
| 0:53:44| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3224)|
| 0:53:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3225)|
| 0:53:46| Thank you for hearing us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3226)|
| 0:53:47| Thank you, Reverend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3227)|

| 0:54:49| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3289)|

| 0:54:53| Oh, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3293)|
| 0:54:54| I'm sorry, Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3294)|
| 0:54:55| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3295)|
| 0:54:56| There's Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3296)|
| 0:54:58| This is a legal question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3298)|
| 0:55:00| My understanding is Ameristeel is going to be asking for their zoning changes to be done on emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3300)|
| 0:55:06| and it actually feels like a very legitimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3306)|
| 0:55:08| These things have been heard twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3308)|
| 0:55:09| Do we need to do this one on emergency as well to do something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3309)|
| 0:55:12| Do we have to repeal things before we can change them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3312)|
| 0:55:19| Does that question make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3319)|
| 0:55:21| The question makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3321)|
| 0:55:22| I have to think about it for just one second because I hadn't thought about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3322)|
| 0:55:25| I think it would be best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3325)|
| 0:55:27| I would agree that we should do this on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3327)|
| 0:55:30| So we need a motion to reconsider to do this on emergency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3330)|
| 0:55:34| Are you voting on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3334)|
| 0:55:36| We haven't voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| We haven't voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3338)|
| 0:55:39| We have not voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3339)|
| 0:55:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3340)|
| 0:55:41| You stopped me right before we got to the all opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3341)|
| 0:55:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3342)|
| 0:55:43| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3343)|
| 0:55:44| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3344)|
| 0:55:45| I don't know if I'm actually going to make a motion to do it on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3345)|

| 0:57:46| Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3466)|
| 0:57:47| Mr. Mayor, members of Council, this ordinance and the next three are a repeat of what you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3467)|
| 0:57:55| passed back in August and September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3475)|
| 0:57:59| Because of a change in state law, publication notice for plan amendments has been extended from 15 days to 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3479)|
| 0:58:08| That was discovered just recently after the prior two ordinances were passed and F, G, H, and I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3488)|
| 0:58:18| So these ordinances have been before MPC twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3498)|
| 0:58:24| Staff has reviewed them twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3504)|
| 0:58:26| They have been unanimously passed by MPC twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3506)|
| 0:58:31| They have been before you all once, or excuse me, for two readings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3511)|
| 0:58:36| and have been unanimously passed by City Council on two readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3516)|
| 0:58:42| This is, in essence, a third reading, but we would request an emergency on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3522)|
| 0:58:51| because we're in the process of closing streets, working with the city on issues like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3531)|
| 0:58:57| And Mr. Trimble is here and can verify everything I've said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3537)|
| 0:59:03| Good to have somebody like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3543)|
| 0:59:09| We're swapping property with KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3549)|

| 0:59:20| No, I agree with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3560)|

| 1:00:02| because now, Mr. Trimble, you've got him as a captive audience on the Lonsdale Rec Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3602)|
| 1:00:08| If we had approved it the first time and it had gone through, you wouldn't be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081202?start=3608)|
