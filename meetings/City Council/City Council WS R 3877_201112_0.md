| 0:01:36| Council and guests, thank you so much for taking the time to be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=96)|
| 0:01:41| Our workshop focus today will be a presentation from the Knoxville Chamber of Commerce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=101)|
| 0:01:46| President Mike Odom, who is the President and CEO, will go over an update on their path to prosperity, a five-year strategic vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=106)|
| 0:01:55| Then we'll also have a review of tax increment financing, which are TIFs and payment in lieu of taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=115)|
| 0:02:03| The pilots, Deputy Chief Stephanie Welch, will lead us in that conversation along with Mr. Mamatov.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=123)|
| 0:02:09| And so this time we're going to go ahead and turn the call over to Mike Odom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=129)|
| 0:02:15| Again, thank you all for being here and taking time to present to us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=135)|
| 0:02:19| Thank you. We appreciate the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=139)|
| 0:02:21| There's nothing better than we like to talk about than ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=141)|
| 0:02:24| So this is a great opportunity for us to give an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=144)|
| 0:02:27| I also want to introduce our Board Chair, Daniel Carter, who is with us as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=147)|
| 0:02:33| So he is here to wave at me if I say something stupid, which will ultimately occur, as you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=153)|
| 0:02:39| So we wanted to give you guys a little bit of an update, as the Vice Mayor said, on path to prosperity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=159)|
| 0:02:44| So I'm going to I'll lead off and go over just a review of what this strategic vision is very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=164)|
| 0:02:49| And then I'm going to kick it over to Doug Boyer, who will cover our economic development work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=169)|
| 0:02:54| and then Amy Nolan, who will cover our regional enhancement work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=174)|
| 0:03:00| And then they're going to get back to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=180)|
| 0:03:02| One of the things that Vice Mayor McKenzie asked was that we kind of give an overview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=182)|
| 0:03:06| and some insight into what we've been doing specifically to the African-American-owned businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=186)|
| 0:03:10| So we're going to give you guys that at the end and kind of walk you through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=190)|
| 0:03:15| So through that, Will, would you mind sharing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=195)|
| 0:03:18| Let me share my screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=198)|
| 0:03:21| You have. Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=201)|
| 0:03:23| So we've got some slides here we're going to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=203)|
| 0:03:25| There's only 452 of them, so it should go pretty quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=205)|
| 0:03:30| Let's see if I can get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=210)|
| 0:03:32| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=212)|
| 0:03:34| So we had the opportunity to meet with all of you to talk about our new strategic vision and to get your input on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=214)|
| 0:03:41| And we really appreciate those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=221)|
| 0:03:43| But it's been a little while since we had those meetings, so I want to kind of give you just a little bit of an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=223)|
| 0:03:47| To remind you, the big thing that we needed to do was we had to get back to our mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=227)|
| 0:03:52| We had lost our way as an organization, and for us, that means driving regional economic prosperity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=232)|
| 0:03:59| Our whole existence here in this community is to ensure that every single person in our community has the ability to be economically prosperous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=239)|
| 0:04:07| to buy a home if they want to buy a home, send their kids to college if they want to send their kids to college,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=247)|
| 0:04:12| retire at an age at which they can enjoy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=252)|
| 0:04:14| And so that's what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=254)|
| 0:04:16| And one of the big things that we really changed our mentality is we got away from the quid pro quo mentality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=256)|
| 0:04:22| which is you pay us and we help you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=262)|
| 0:04:25| Our whole being now is we're just going to help businesses and people because that's what we're here to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=265)|
| 0:04:31| So that's the ultimate destination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=271)|
| 0:04:33| What we needed was the roadmap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=273)|
| 0:04:35| And that's where Pat's Prosperity comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=275)|
| 0:04:37| And the key to that is to create that vibrant, innovative economic ecosystem where we're thinking about and trying to solve the problems of today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=277)|
| 0:04:44| At the same time, thinking aspirationally 20 years, 20, 25 years in the future, where do we want to end up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=284)|
| 0:04:52| And the key to that is that circle in front of you, which is those six pieces of the economic ecosystem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=292)|
| 0:04:58| So first is business expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=298)|
| 0:05:01| We have really changed the way we do things and that the resources, time, effort, money that we were putting into business attraction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=301)|
| 0:05:08| now is to help the businesses here be able to reach their potential, reach their dreams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=308)|
| 0:05:13| That doesn't mean, though, that we ignore the business attraction piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=313)|
| 0:05:16| There are businesses out there that we just can't grow organically, and mainly to support the businesses that are already here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=316)|
| 0:05:23| So it's the proverbial two bears with one stone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=323)|
| 0:05:26| But you must have the next four pieces, what we call regional enhancement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=326)|
| 0:05:30| And those must be very robust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=330)|
| 0:05:31| So the business climate, which is tax, regulatory, health care, the infrastructure, public transportation, broadband, roads, bridges, things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=331)|
| 0:05:40| Talent, which is public ed, post-secondary ed, workforce development, inclusion, talent retention, attraction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=340)|
| 0:05:46| And then finally, entrepreneurship, small business, where we need to get more businesses started, help them become successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=346)|
| 0:05:52| And then they become part of that business expansion effort to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=352)|
| 0:05:55| So that's the mission, the vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=355)|
| 0:05:57| And then the plan consists of six priorities that we have committed to accomplishing in the next five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=357)|
| 0:06:04| We're going to do a lot more than that, and you'll see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=364)|
| 0:06:07| But these are the six that, no matter what, we want to try to get done in the next five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=367)|
| 0:06:12| And so Amy is going to go over and talk about where we are in each of these, from the workforce development strategy, the talent retention strategy, the infrastructure strategy, access to capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=372)|
| 0:06:22| Doug will talk about the business expansion focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=382)|
| 0:06:26| But the last piece is something I'm going to cover real quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=386)|
| 0:06:31| When I was preparing to move here, a lot of people told me, look, once you get there, you'll fall in love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=391)|
| 0:06:37| And we have. My family and I love it here now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=397)|
| 0:06:39| We really feel that we're Knoxvillians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=399)|
| 0:06:42| The problem is we can't get all the people and the businesses to experience Knoxville first before we can get them here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=402)|
| 0:06:49| So we've got to take the essence of what that is to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=409)|
| 0:06:52| And so we have committed to doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=412)|
| 0:06:54| Many of you have been a part of these discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=414)|
| 0:06:56| We engage with a local firm called Bold Square to help us do that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=416)|
| 0:07:00| So they have progressively made progress on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=420)|
| 0:07:04| And we should have some first kind of round renderings of this in the next month, as a matter of fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=424)|
| 0:07:10| I was on a call today with the CEO of a very large company here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=430)|
| 0:07:15| And he said, if you guys can accomplish number six, it would be the biggest help for us to be able to grow our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=435)|
| 0:07:21| And so that's what we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=441)|
| 0:07:23| So I'm going to now kick it over to Doug so he can go over economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=443)|
| 0:07:27| I'm going to share this with you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=447)|
| 0:07:29| Doug?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=449)|
| 0:07:31| Well, good afternoon, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=451)|
| 0:07:33| Appreciate the opportunity to speak with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=453)|
| 0:07:35| And as Mike said, in the Path to Prosperity plan, you kind of look at that circle within what's at the top of that ecosystem is business expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=455)|
| 0:07:44| And that's something that my team on the economic development side is taking very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=464)|
| 0:07:50| So since July 1 of this year, our team here at the Chamber has met with 169 of our existing businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=470)|
| 0:07:57| And so this is being led by my Director of Business Expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=477)|
| 0:08:02| His name is Wilson Meyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=482)|
| 0:08:04| He comes to us with a deep background in logistics with UPS and is just doing an exceptional job at, one, getting in the door to meet with companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=484)|
| 0:08:14| And then, two, helping them understand the resources and opportunities that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=494)|
| 0:08:19| And I don't want to confuse this number 169 with, you know, the Chamber investment side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=499)|
| 0:08:24| That's a whole different conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=504)|
| 0:08:27| You know, when we're meeting with existing businesses, it is not about investing in the Knoxville Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=507)|
| 0:08:33| It is making sure they're aware of the resources and programs that we have to support growth in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=513)|
| 0:08:39| So you can see the numbers of the types of how many companies we visited with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=519)|
| 0:08:43| The types of companies we're visiting with is really across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=523)|
| 0:08:47| You know, we've got strategic platforms of companies that we are trying to grow in this ecosystem here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=527)|
| 0:08:53| Communication, health, power, movement, and security are the five platforms of types of companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=533)|
| 0:09:01| So what we're doing is we get in, whether it's a virtual Zoom conversation or a face-to-face conversation, asking about their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=541)|
| 0:09:10| What is going on in your business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=550)|
| 0:09:12| What are the opportunities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=552)|
| 0:09:13| What are the challenges?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=553)|
| 0:09:14| What are you struggling with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=554)|
| 0:09:16| Really where we're trying to get even more to in these visits is coming in armed with data and information so that we might be able to say to the company's CEO, for example, we know that your sector is growing X percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=556)|
| 0:09:29| How does that, you know, over the past five years, how does that compare with your growth here in Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=569)|
| 0:09:34| If there's a gap, maybe there are things that we can work towards to help out with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=574)|
| 0:09:40| So some of the trends that we're seeing from these business expansion visits, you can see their workforce is number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=580)|
| 0:09:48| All companies are really struggling to find workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=588)|
| 0:09:53| We are really trying to help companies as they are purchasing goods and services to do their daily business, encouraging them to find local suppliers and vendors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=593)|
| 0:10:03| You'd be surprised as we kind of peel back the onion skin and dig into those conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=603)|
| 0:10:09| Hey, we're buying raw material from somebody up in the Midwest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=609)|
| 0:10:12| When it turns out there's a company here in Knoxville or much closer that might be able to provide that product or that service to help support that company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=612)|
| 0:10:22| We're seeing our high value products manufacturing in the Knoxville area is booming all over the place, particularly the higher value products.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=622)|
| 0:10:32| You know, the more technical, you know, medical device manufacturers, pharmaceutical food production is all doing very, very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=632)|
| 0:10:41| You know, there's no surprise that travel and hospitality sectors are are still kind of struggling here in the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=641)|
| 0:10:48| And it's something new that we're doing that I think we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=648)|
| 0:10:52| Two of these issues of eco, the economic conditions outlook is a monthly report that is generated internally here by our research guide, Joe Riley, looking at statistics and trends on a monthly basis in the manufacturing, retail and services sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=652)|
| 0:11:09| So this is a service that we're pushing out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=669)|
| 0:11:13| Thanks to First Horizon Bank for sponsoring that publication for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=673)|
| 0:11:17| But that's a real value add tool that anybody in our community, we think, can benefit from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=677)|
| 0:11:26| And so I want to give a case example of how kind of a business expansion process works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=686)|
| 0:11:31| So Fraley and Schilling is a company I know you guys have heard of as counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=691)|
| 0:11:35| This is a company that's in Councilwoman Ryder's district out off the Strawberry Plains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=695)|
| 0:11:41| We had a business expansion visit with that company face to face back last fall, just over a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=701)|
| 0:11:47| We learned at that time companies based in India and they were looking at a potential expansion here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=707)|
| 0:11:55| So we quickly plugged in and got our partners with the state of Tennessee Economic Development, TVA, plugged into those conversations and just helping them understand how Knoxville can help benefit their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=715)|
| 0:12:12| And so the end result is they are going to be hiring 110 new positions with an average wage of $55,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=732)|
| 0:12:20| So Fraley and Schilling has five truck terminals around the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=740)|
| 0:12:25| Every single new hire that is hired by Fraley and Schilling will now come to Knoxville and spend three to four nights in Knoxville getting trained on safety and their HR protocols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=745)|
| 0:12:36| So that's a huge economic impact beyond this 10,000 square foot expansion and 110 new jobs there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=756)|
| 0:12:45| So that project actually is breaking ground on Monday for their new office operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=765)|
| 0:12:51| And then on the, as Mike mentioned, we're certainly not forgetting about trying to attract new business or recruit new businesses to Knoxville and path to prosperity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=771)|
| 0:13:03| And over the past several months we've had, you can see the numbers up there, 13 new projects added to our pipeline with a potential investment of another $135 million in 1,200 jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=783)|
| 0:13:15| And really the action we're seeing on the attraction side is heavy involved in information technology companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=795)|
| 0:13:23| We've seen a lot of food manufacturing, medical device, logistic services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=803)|
| 0:13:28| The project Malibu, the Knoxville center mall redevelopment certainly falls within that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=808)|
| 0:13:33| And then the boating industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=813)|
| 0:13:35| With COVID, everyone is buying boats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=815)|
| 0:13:38| And they can't make them fast enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=818)|
| 0:13:40| And there's a lot of suppliers looking around this region to locate additional marine product operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=820)|
| 0:13:49| A couple of interesting things that we're doing now is, you know, we're always going to get leads from TVA economic development, state of Tennessee economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=829)|
| 0:13:58| But we're being pushed really hard to generate our own leads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=838)|
| 0:14:02| And a couple of examples of what we're doing with that is, one, Chicago area is a geography that we are targeting specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=842)|
| 0:14:12| We have done a lot of social media outreach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=852)|
| 0:14:15| We've created that image you see there on the right side of the slide is a micro website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=855)|
| 0:14:20| If you go to Knoxvillechamber.com forward slash Chicago, you can look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=860)|
| 0:14:25| And that does kind of a comparison of the two markets, what it's like to live in Knoxville, what the cost of living is, taxes, utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=865)|
| 0:14:33| It really just kind of outlined the business case of, hey, company in Chicago, we think there's an opportunity for you to do an expansion down in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=873)|
| 0:14:42| We've had we've got a goal to have at least 10 conversations with Chicago based companies, and we've achieved eight thus far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=882)|
| 0:14:51| And several of those are turning into and turning into next steps and really digging into UT alumni,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=891)|
| 0:15:00| zeroing on Chicago based University of Tennessee alumni and C-suite positions and starting with those folks and just a lot of LinkedIn and good old fashioned email outreach to those companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=900)|
| 0:15:13| Another thing that we're doing is we recently briefed all of the foreign direct investment team for the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=913)|
| 0:15:19| So they have offices in England and Germany, Korea, Japan, China.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=919)|
| 0:15:26| And we briefed all of those offices on what's going on in Knoxville with business recruitment, business expansion, new product, new business parts coming online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=926)|
| 0:15:35| So they're familiar with that. And then this is this is a specific example of a business attraction project that we're working that we've codenamed Project Buffalo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=935)|
| 0:15:46| This is a company that is based up in New York state. They have developed a technology to for autonomous boats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=946)|
| 0:15:55| And so we had one of our chamber board members is is a native of Buffalo, New York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=955)|
| 0:16:02| He saw a story about them in his hometown newspaper and said a company in the autonomous boat sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=962)|
| 0:16:08| They should be in Knoxville, Tennessee. Why? What are they doing in Buffalo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=968)|
| 0:16:11| So we started reaching out to that company, created some micro websites, did social media targeting around that and a little bit of social media stalking and stalking by yours truly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=971)|
| 0:16:24| And we finally got a conversation with the CEO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=984)|
| 0:16:28| And I am excited that the CEO is going to be in town next week looking at potentially launching an autonomous water taxi and a pilot demonstration project the same day as the UT Florida football game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=988)|
| 0:16:44| So the end game is that that company, obviously, we want this to go more than than floating a boat back and forth across the river from such free landing to volunteer landing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1004)|
| 0:16:55| But, you know, getting that R&D and getting him plugged into our ecosystem down here and hopefully ultimately putting some jobs here in Knoxville within that sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1015)|
| 0:17:06| So I will pause there, see if there are any questions and hand it over to Amy Noland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1026)|
| 0:17:14| It's the one on the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1034)|
| 0:17:18| All right. Thank you. I'm glad to have the opportunity to talk to you all about something other than zoning and and sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1038)|
| 0:17:26| So thank you. I'm going to go through some of these initiatives that we're working on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1046)|
| 0:17:33| And the chamber plays a lot of different roles. Sometimes we're the convener. Sometimes we're the organizer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1053)|
| 0:17:40| Sometimes we're a supporter and sometimes we're a promoter and champion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1060)|
| 0:17:47| So I'm going to go through these. We have four pillars under regional enhancement, entrepreneurship and small business is one of the areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1067)|
| 0:17:57| For each of these areas, we have a council made up of volunteer leaders that that works with our staff and and directs us on these initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1077)|
| 0:18:10| So the first that we're actively working and supporting is the hundred Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1090)|
| 0:18:17| The 800 initiative in Memphis with the goal of growing black owned businesses with employees in Knoxville by 10 million in five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1097)|
| 0:18:27| How are we going to do that? We're recruiting coaches and mentors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1107)|
| 0:18:32| Currently, it'll be an investment in time and talent, along with access to social, political and financial capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1112)|
| 0:18:41| We're in the process. We've created a list of probably 400 or so firms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1121)|
| 0:18:48| We're looking to identify 10 or more firms with employees and double their revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1128)|
| 0:18:54| Identify another 25 without employees and increase their revenue to 100000 per year and hopefully give them a chance to hire one additional employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1134)|
| 0:19:07| This regional access to capital strategy, this is more of a long term goal where we see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1147)|
| 0:19:15| We hear it along the spectrum of businesses from startup to actually established businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1155)|
| 0:19:23| The capital is an issue and impediment to their growing in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1163)|
| 0:19:29| So we have taken on this work to create this strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1169)|
| 0:19:34| We will identify a spectrum of funding sources, evaluate those sources, particularly regarding their ability to eliminate disparities of financing and implement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1174)|
| 0:19:48| We recognize that there are a lot of folks working in the entrepreneurial ecosystem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1188)|
| 0:19:55| We have the Knoxville Entrepreneurial System downstairs, Anderson Center at UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1195)|
| 0:20:02| We'll be working with all of those individuals and organizations in creating the strategy and then also their roles in implementing that strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1202)|
| 0:20:13| Luckily, we received a 20000 dollar grant to hire a consultant to write the strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1213)|
| 0:20:22| So we're looking at candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1222)|
| 0:20:25| Currently, phase one will be interviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1225)|
| 0:20:29| The surveys will be researching peer communities and then developing recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1229)|
| 0:20:36| We believe this process will take four to six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1236)|
| 0:20:40| We hope to be able to start in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1240)|
| 0:20:43| Under the infrastructure umbrella, the Enoch's Task Force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1243)|
| 0:20:49| This, again, was something we knew when we adopted our business plan that we wanted high speed Internet, broadband Internet for the region to be a strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1249)|
| 0:21:02| COVID-19 actually accelerated that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1262)|
| 0:21:07| While we were the convener, I think a lot of folks in Knoxville were having the same idea at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1267)|
| 0:21:15| So we were able to put a group together very quickly in May to talk about what would we do to create an emergency Internet access plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1275)|
| 0:21:27| Originally, we thought we'd be implementing that in January or February of this year when police season was upon us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1287)|
| 0:21:35| As it happened, we began implementing that plan in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1295)|
| 0:21:40| So far, we've provided about 800 households with subsidized service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1300)|
| 0:21:46| We are steadily adding households as schools go red.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1306)|
| 0:21:52| Today, those students' households are being serviced with Comcast where available and with hotspots in my eyes where it's not available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1312)|
| 0:22:03| But we are looking at what could be a more efficient, a more thorough way of serving where we know there are high needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1323)|
| 0:22:13| So today, actually, there's a team looking around the Western Heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1333)|
| 0:22:20| Neighborhood looking at the KCDC, actually, their physical facilities as well as Emerald View Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1340)|
| 0:22:28| The other high points in the Lonsdale community to see if we can launch some more universal service there using a CBRS spectrum and antenna radio signals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1348)|
| 0:22:44| So we'll have more on that as that progresses, and we will continue to champion the need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1364)|
| 0:22:50| I think this has really revealed the COVID, the need for high speed Internet for every Knoxville citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1370)|
| 0:22:58| It makes a difference in the workforce as well as learning, both secondary and post-secondary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1378)|
| 0:23:06| To create a workforce development strategy, we really wanted to see what work was already being done in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1386)|
| 0:23:15| And towards that end, we created this workforce services directory, not just for our own use, but also community use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1395)|
| 0:23:25| It is available on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1405)|
| 0:23:28| We highlight services provided by 43 different organizations, and it's searchable by 11 different categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1408)|
| 0:23:36| And that can range from justice involved to youth to young adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1416)|
| 0:23:42| We want the users to be three categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| Individuals who are seeking employment services need some kind of training to be ready for the next step of employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1426)|
| 0:23:57| Organizations who might be seeking to make referrals and then employers that want to expand their labor pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1437)|
| 0:24:05| As Doug mentioned, we hear workforce constantly is a challenge for employers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1445)|
| 0:24:13| and we want them to start looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1453)|
| 0:24:15| Can they look at some alternative organizations or places to expand that labor pool?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1455)|
| 0:24:26| Again, accelerated training opportunities were something we always knew that needed to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1466)|
| 0:24:33| especially in the trades related where industry certifications are much more important than a diploma or degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1473)|
| 0:24:44| So working with TCAT, TCAT was able to stand up very quickly this summer and fall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1484)|
| 0:24:53| fast path training in six different industries, offering night and weekend classes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1493)|
| 0:25:00| working with tuition assistance available with the American Job Center to provide even some things like work boots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1500)|
| 0:25:09| safety glasses, and other things that workers would need to take advantage of this training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1509)|
| 0:25:18| We're also working to better align education with industry needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1518)|
| 0:25:23| We have just concluded a talent assessment survey of employers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1523)|
| 0:25:29| We had about 200 employers answer that survey to discuss the employers, their needs now and in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1529)|
| 0:25:38| Friday, we will have our second meeting of a quarterly gathering of secondary and post-secondary leaders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1538)|
| 0:25:46| That really became evident to us that Knox County schools are often creating CTE programming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1546)|
| 0:25:55| and we want to make sure that's aligned with offerings at Pellissippi, Brown State, and TCAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1555)|
| 0:26:02| So, for example, how high school is starting an aviation program, we want to make sure that they're aware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1562)|
| 0:26:10| and that is linked with the aviation programming helping at Pellissippi State Magnolia Campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1570)|
| 0:26:20| We want to make this connection with industry at Knox County Schools stickier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1580)|
| 0:26:26| They do training in 16 different career clusters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1586)|
| 0:26:30| We held an event with them to recruit for their advisory councils last week, attended by 60 different employers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1590)|
| 0:26:40| and they're following up with them now, having those specific cluster meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1600)|
| 0:26:46| All of this is going into the creation of our regional workforce development strategy that we will be outlining in the coming months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1606)|
| 0:26:56| Workforce development. Again, under that bucket, we would put workforce transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1616)|
| 0:27:04| Our goal is to improve public transit to employment centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1624)|
| 0:27:10| and we hope to start a pilot project specifically with Forks of the River Industrial Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1630)|
| 0:27:17| We owe a funds. We recognize that we have some challenge here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1637)|
| 0:27:24| and we want to, going forward, really support processes and policies to ensure these funds are allotted equitably, efficiently, and creatively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1644)|
| 0:27:39| As TCAT, for example, has been more creative and offering accelerated training opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1659)|
| 0:27:47| we want to make sure that the dollars are following these students into these kinds of programming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1667)|
| 0:27:54| and that they can, when we have instances like COVID, where the hospitality industry was turned upside down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1674)|
| 0:28:03| that they are able to meet, in a fast and flexible way, the needs of these employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1683)|
| 0:28:14| Finally, I'm going to give it back to Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1694)|
| 0:28:18| So, thank you, Amy. I owe you all an apology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1698)|
| 0:28:22| I promised Amy at the beginning what I would say is, please know, we don't do any of this work alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1702)|
| 0:28:30| It takes an enormous amount of collaboration and partnership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1710)|
| 0:28:35| and there is absolutely nothing that we do alone, unless we screw up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1715)|
| 0:28:39| In which case, then we do do it alone. It's usually me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1719)|
| 0:28:42| And we're very thankful for that partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1722)|
| 0:28:45| The city, the administration team has been great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1725)|
| 0:28:48| Amy mentioned the American Job Center has money to put forth for this fast path training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1728)|
| 0:28:54| You all put forth money to do that as well, which we appreciate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| It's helped a lot of those kids in the plumbing, not kids, adults, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1737)|
| 0:29:01| And the plumbing accelerated certification program had things like helmets and hats and belts and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1741)|
| 0:29:10| So, we really appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| I do also want to say one thing before we go to this last piece, is that we are essentially your economic development arm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1752)|
| 0:29:21| Actually, we consider your economic prosperity arm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1761)|
| 0:29:24| And I want you to know that the team here is working extremely hard on your behalf,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1764)|
| 0:29:30| and to ensure that our mission is fulfilled every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1770)|
| 0:29:33| We're very, very proud of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1773)|
| 0:29:35| Obviously, we turned their world upside down earlier this year with the adoption of Path to Prosperity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1775)|
| 0:29:40| and they have reacted beautifully and couldn't be more proud of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1780)|
| 0:29:44| So, with that, now to the last piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1784)|
| 0:29:47| As I said, Vice Mayor McKenzie asked to talk a little bit about what we're doing for African-American-owned businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1787)|
| 0:29:54| And we have done things that are more traditional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1794)|
| 0:29:57| So, for instance, you know, we have participated in the city and KDCs and UTs Expo and getting more DBEs involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1797)|
| 0:30:10| We've had meetings and follow-ups with the cosmetology industry of African-American-owned businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1810)|
| 0:30:17| We have done a lot of different things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1817)|
| 0:30:20| But overall, we're taking a different perspective on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1820)|
| 0:30:23| We are trying to, again, be able to address these needs in a bigger fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1823)|
| 0:30:29| And so, I wanted to kind of walk through this a little bit with you and kind of give you some perspective on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1829)|
| 0:30:35| So, the first part, give me some context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1835)|
| 0:30:38| So, this is the population of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1838)|
| 0:30:41| And we're going to use the county for this simply because it's harder to get city data for across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1841)|
| 0:30:47| The county is much easier for us to identify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1847)|
| 0:30:50| And so, this is the population broken up by poverty and non-poverty rate within our white and black African-American population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1850)|
| 0:30:58| So, you know, of the 400,000 of the white population in Knox County, about 12% of them live in poverty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1858)|
| 0:31:05| While in our African-American community, which makes up about 9% of our community, it's about 32%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1865)|
| 0:31:15| So, you know, much higher percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1875)|
| 0:31:18| And Stephanie used the word the other day in our board meeting, unconscionable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1878)|
| 0:31:25| Sorry, I can't say it as well as she did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| But this is, again, the whole reason we exist is economic prosperity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1887)|
| 0:31:32| And so, this is our enemy, is that poverty rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1892)|
| 0:31:35| And I know a lot of discussion, rightfully so, is around that 42%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1895)|
| 0:31:39| A, that's in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1899)|
| 0:31:41| And B, that's from a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| This data is actually estimated for 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1903)|
| 0:31:46| So, our hope is that estimate comes through and that the numbers go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1906)|
| 0:31:50| Although this is done obviously before the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1910)|
| 0:31:53| So, we're not holding out a lot of hope that that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1913)|
| 0:31:56| And so, we've got our work cut out for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1916)|
| 0:31:58| And so, what I want to do now is just kind of show you how a lot of the things that mainly what Amy talked about relate to our work with helping this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1918)|
| 0:32:06| So, when we talk about the 100 Knoxville Initiative, of which we're one of many people participating, you know, this comes from Goldman Sachs and their 10,000 Small Businesses Initiative, which is which they invest in 10,000 small businesses across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1926)|
| 0:32:20| They did a survey of those 10,000 businesses during the pandemic and found that 61% of black business owners have foregone paying themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1940)|
| 0:32:28| So, have no discernible income because of the recession, the economic pressures we're feeling right now, which you can see is 9 percentage points higher than the overall group in itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1948)|
| 0:32:42| The worst is of those black business owners, 58% have had to dip into their personal savings to stay operational versus the overall group, which is about 33%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1962)|
| 0:32:53| So, there's a 25 percentage point difference there between black owners and non-black owners who had to dip into the personal savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1973)|
| 0:33:00| And so, these are the things that we're trying to address, why we want to be a part and active participant in 100 Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1980)|
| 0:33:07| Entrepreneurs, so we talked about the access to capital strategy that we're working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1987)|
| 0:33:11| We're very thankful for the Truist Bank Foundation for supporting us financially with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1991)|
| 0:33:16| So, again, if you look at the population of Knox County, about 9%, as I said, of our population is African-American.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=1996)|
| 0:33:25| But when you look at the profits negatively impacted by the lack of access to capital, 22% of African-American business entrepreneurs are affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2005)|
| 0:33:34| So, much more proportionally, the work that we can do will impact positively our African-American community than it will be for our other groupings there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2014)|
| 0:33:43| So, when you talk about access to capital, a lot of people obviously talk about, well, these millions and millions of dollars for these tech startups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2023)|
| 0:33:50| Well, really, it's much more basic than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2030)|
| 0:33:53| It's A, the hairdresser that needs a microloan to buy a piece of equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2033)|
| 0:33:59| It's that business owner that if they could just buy that piece, that new piece of equipment, be able to go into a new line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2039)|
| 0:34:05| And so, that's critical for us to develop the strategy and implement it in an active manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2045)|
| 0:34:11| The Knox Task Force, you know, that's kind of common sense, but let me just show you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2051)|
| 0:34:16| So, about 20% of our Knox County schools' kiddos are African-American or mixed race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2056)|
| 0:34:24| But of the 800 that Amy mentioned that we have assisted so far, more than a quarter of them are African-American, mixed race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2064)|
| 0:34:32| So, again, we're proportionally, it's a much bigger impact for those members, our neighbors in that group versus is it everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2072)|
| 0:34:41| And we think that that number will continue to rise as we impact more communities on that front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2081)|
| 0:34:47| This is one that absolutely concerns us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2087)|
| 0:34:51| So, this is the Knox County unemployment rate since 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2091)|
| 0:34:56| The state didn't have 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| We're not sure why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2098)|
| 0:34:59| So, but those other five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2099)|
| 0:35:02| So, our African-American unemployment rate typically runs at a minimum of two percentage points above what it is for our white unemployment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2102)|
| 0:35:11| You can see back in the recessionary period of 2014, it was almost 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2111)|
| 0:35:17| This is why we are spending so much time focused on talent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2117)|
| 0:35:22| As we told you and others, we will spend the vast majority of our time and work in the next 15 years on this subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2122)|
| 0:35:30| We have got to figure out our talent and our workforce piece out to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2130)|
| 0:35:36| So, and a big piece of that is transit, public transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2136)|
| 0:35:41| So, there's typically four legs to the proverbial stool when it comes to workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2141)|
| 0:35:47| One is skills development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2147)|
| 0:35:50| Two is transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| Three is childcare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2153)|
| 0:35:56| And four is affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| On the childcare front, we actually did help finance a statewide research report on childcare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2158)|
| 0:36:06| We hope that will be part of our work as well as possibly affordable housing in future years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2166)|
| 0:36:10| But right now, this public transportation issue is a key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2170)|
| 0:36:14| You know, we had a conversation with the administration recently that public transportation was tough to fund before the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2174)|
| 0:36:22| It's going to be almost impossible to do it from now on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2182)|
| 0:36:26| And so, this is the time for us to think differently, for us to be really innovative on doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2186)|
| 0:36:31| And to their credit, the administration will agree so heartily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2191)|
| 0:36:35| So, again, the Nox County population, 9% of it is African-American.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2195)|
| 0:36:39| But of the CAT ridership, and these numbers are 2017, over 30% of their ridership is African-American.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2199)|
| 0:36:47| And so, we've got to get this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| And this is a great opportunity for us to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2209)|
| 0:36:52| And then finally, Amy mentioned the American Job Center, which is called our WIB, our Workforce Investment Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2212)|
| 0:36:59| And millions upon millions of dollars from the federal government gets filed down into the American Job Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2219)|
| 0:37:05| This is the one-stop shop where you go when you lose your job or looking to find a new career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2225)|
| 0:37:11| So, of theirs in the last little more than a year of what they call customers, almost 30% have been African-American.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2231)|
| 0:37:22| And so, this is why we have really aggressively started to work with them to improve, try to make sure that they're thinking innovatively, making sure they're thinking strategically, because this is how we're going to impact this in a positive way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2242)|
| 0:37:37| So, with that, we're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2257)|
| 0:37:40| I promised Stephanie we would take 110 minutes, and we did not do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2260)|
| 0:37:44| But we're happy to answer any questions that you may have at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2264)|
| 0:37:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2271)|
| 0:37:52| Can you hear me, Mike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2274)|
| 0:37:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2275)|
| 0:37:56| I had a question when you were talking about workforce transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| Amy mentioned a pilot project at the Forks of the River Industrial Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2279)|
| 0:38:05| Can you tell us a little bit about what that would look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2285)|
| 0:38:08| It's still in the early stages, Councilmember Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2288)|
| 0:38:12| But we have, I think, is it three expansions going on there now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2292)|
| 0:38:17| Three expansions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| At least three expansions with no, and they are not, because they're not within the city limits, they have no public transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2299)|
| 0:38:26| Not to mention, we have talked to businesses there who would like to start working either through apprenticeship, I'm sorry, internships or some workplace learning with the high schools, and there's no way to get the kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2306)|
| 0:38:40| If you can get them there, you can't get them back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2320)|
| 0:38:42| So we've had some early conversations with Mayor Jacob's office about trying to do a pilot over there, and they have been very open to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2322)|
| 0:38:51| We have spoken with the chair of the CAT board, one Mr. Doug Boyer, and he's all aboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2331)|
| 0:38:59| I don't know if he's talked to the CAT team at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2339)|
| 0:39:02| And so we're just in the beginning stages of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2342)|
| 0:39:09| I'm sorry, Councilmember Thomas, you're on mute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| I just applaud the initiative and keep me posted on how that develops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2352)|
| 0:39:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2357)|
| 0:39:18| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2358)|
| 0:39:19| And Stephanie has been a huge proponent of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| So she gets a lot of credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2361)|
| 0:39:28| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2368)|
| 0:39:29| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2369)|
| 0:39:30| Do you want me to say who should speak next or do you want to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2370)|
| 0:39:34| I didn't want to overstep my bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2376)|
| 0:39:37| You call on us because I actually I don't have everyone on my screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2377)|
| 0:39:41| So you may see all of us more broadly than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2381)|
| 0:39:44| So a couple of things on the presentation when you guys talked about you had one hundred and sixty nine visits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2384)|
| 0:39:52| It looks like in a quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2392)|
| 0:39:54| How many of those visits were small or black businesses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2394)|
| 0:39:59| If you have that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| Yeah, I don't have that information right here in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| But we are going to kind of point out that information as well as the number of broken down those within the city of Knoxville and those in the county balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2404)|
| 0:40:14| But we'll I'll circle back to the council with that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2414)|
| 0:40:17| OK, that would I think that would be very beneficial and helpful for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2417)|
| 0:40:21| And then also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2421)|
| 0:40:24| Amy, in your presentation with the one hundred Knoxville initiative, did I hear you correctly to say that there were 400 businesses that were identified?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2424)|
| 0:40:34| Yes, but those have not been they have been identified, but they have not been verified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2434)|
| 0:40:40| So I will say that that comes from different websites, the city purchasing department, county purchasing departments, news clippings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2440)|
| 0:40:52| So that is an overall that that list seems verified still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2452)|
| 0:40:57| And I think the end list will be much smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2457)|
| 0:41:02| Yeah, that that number seems pretty inflated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2462)|
| 0:41:05| But I'd be interested to have a follow up on that once you have that information available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2465)|
| 0:41:11| And then as it relates to the American Job Center and Amy, you know, you and I had this experience there at the Change Center where they had a seminar that was in the middle of the day and it was very, very poorly attended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2471)|
| 0:41:27| And so I guess I want to ask you, have you seen their outreach and marketing show improvement to this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2487)|
| 0:41:37| No, we have not. We have done a follow up meeting with them, a very lengthy meeting that Mike was partying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2497)|
| 0:41:45| I think we expressed some concern that they acknowledged their caseload has actually decreased during this time when the need has substantially increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2505)|
| 0:41:59| We have put that on our agenda for the coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2519)|
| 0:42:03| Mike has some experience working on this issue, both in Texas and Louisiana.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2523)|
| 0:42:10| So he is going to mentor us through that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2530)|
| 0:42:14| And we hear you when we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2534)|
| 0:42:18| That is on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2538)|
| 0:42:19| But, yes, we are. We are disappointed in their ability to be react faster and to be more flexible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2539)|
| 0:42:27| We have expressed that and we'll continue to work with them on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2547)|
| 0:42:32| And Vice Mayor McKenzie, it's, we just, so Doug mentioned ECHO, our new economic conditions outlook report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2552)|
| 0:42:40| And so this one in October, we actually added to that survey asking, were you aware, are you familiar, asking business leaders, are you familiar with the American Job Center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2560)|
| 0:42:50| And three quarters of them were not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2570)|
| 0:42:53| And that's a problem because they're, and look, they're very open to working with us, which we appreciate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2573)|
| 0:43:00| But until the business community understands the value of having a high performance, high performing workforce investment board, it's going to be difficult to effect change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2580)|
| 0:43:11| And so our job now is to work with them, to take their goodwill and their willingness to work with them, as well as to expose them to, I mean, add exposure, not in a bad way, to the business community so they can, their expectations increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2591)|
| 0:43:27| I think our last count is they're close to $10 million, is that right, of federal funding goes through their doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2607)|
| 0:43:35| So if you have to file for unemployment insurance, you have to work with them to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2615)|
| 0:43:40| And so it is the, I remember Council Member Smith and I had this conversation months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2620)|
| 0:43:46| This is where you have to get this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2626)|
| 0:43:48| Because if you fix this, then everything starts to fall into place after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2628)|
| 0:43:53| And so we're committed to doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2633)|
| 0:43:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2636)|
| 0:43:57| Very huge concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| Very huge concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2639)|
| 0:44:00| And at the same time, I want to ask the Chamber, what is your outreach in the African-American community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2640)|
| 0:44:09| Well, a lot of it now is through our business expansion efforts, is we're really going out and talking to try to identify this business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2649)|
| 0:44:17| You know, the Hunter Knoxville collection of those companies is going to help us do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2657)|
| 0:44:22| You know, I agree with you, it's probably inflated pretty highly, pretty high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2662)|
| 0:44:26| One thing that we're just starting now is the county clerk's office about a year ago, I think it's been a year, started adding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2666)|
| 0:44:36| So everyone that wants to start a business in either the city or the county, I guess just the county, has to get a business license from the clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2676)|
| 0:44:46| And the county was kind enough to add a disadvantaged business piece of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2686)|
| 0:44:52| So you can check off if you're minority, woman, veteran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2692)|
| 0:44:56| Unfortunately, so they give us that data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2696)|
| 0:45:00| Unfortunately, they cannot by law tie the data together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2700)|
| 0:45:04| So we'll get the name of the company, but we can't see if they have self-identified as an African-American business or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2704)|
| 0:45:12| And so we are working our way to hopefully being part of our legislative agenda to get the state law changed on this front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2712)|
| 0:45:20| So that will help us to be able to start identifying these businesses once they get that business license to go to them and say, how can we help you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2720)|
| 0:45:27| Which is what our business expansion efforts are trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2727)|
| 0:45:31| And, you know, I really want to, I'm sorry, did Doug have something he wanted to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2731)|
| 0:45:36| I was just going to say that, you know, I've said this to several of you individually, but I think it's worth repeating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2736)|
| 0:45:42| If you have constituents in your district that you would like for the chamber to reach out to for a business expansion conversation, please send that to me or send it to Mike and any one of us here on this call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2742)|
| 0:45:53| And we'll get it routed to the right folks to make sure that happens quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2753)|
| 0:45:57| But any any time we would we would welcome that that warmly for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2757)|
| 0:46:03| OK, and thank you for that, Doug. I want to be really clear that the reputation of the chamber in the African-American community historically has been that it has been exclusive and not inclusive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2763)|
| 0:46:15| And so, Mike, I know that I shared that with you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2775)|
| 0:46:19| So, again, I really would like to see you guys connecting with other agencies and organizations that are doing some grassroots outreach in the African-American community or that are centrally located there as it relates to your workforce development and job placement to help move that paradigm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2779)|
| 0:46:38| I see that you have some goals and some measurables there, but I think you're going to be hard pressed to to meet those without those collaborations, because, again, it's just historically not being the most friendly organization for African-Americans to access or to have an interest in even accessing because of that reputation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2798)|
| 0:46:58| And so I think that you you guys receive that. And I'm also looking forward to the 100 initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2818)|
| 0:47:08| I think that I'm very familiar with the 800 initiative from Memphis. And so I think that it can absolutely move the paradigm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2828)|
| 0:47:15| So when Doug talked about, you know, hey, they're making so many votes and everybody's buying votes, I want to see more people in my community, African-American people have the the opportunity for prosperity to be able to go out and buy votes as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2835)|
| 0:47:28| And so, while I appreciate all that you guys are doing, there is there is a lot of work that needs to be done moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2848)|
| 0:47:36| So I will look forward to work with you guys on your progress and anything I can do to assist you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2856)|
| 0:47:42| But I did I would be remiss if I did not share that publicly and openly with you on what that perception has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2862)|
| 0:47:48| Absolutely. And I think that is that is a is although I haven't been here that long, I think that's a fair criticism and insight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2868)|
| 0:47:57| I will say that we have it is a big part of what we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2877)|
| 0:48:03| We have to build up some credibility. We have to you know, we have to do this for a while and do well so that we those groups will accept us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2883)|
| 0:48:10| But we have done things, for instance, we've added spots on our board for the Urban League and for YWCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2890)|
| 0:48:18| We have really worked hard to decrease the diversity of our board outside of those organizations with African-American, Hispanic stakeholders and business owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2898)|
| 0:48:31| So we 100 percent agree with you and appreciate that perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2911)|
| 0:48:36| Thank you. This is this is Daniel Carter as a chair, if I can step in for a second to say Mike and his team really are trying hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2916)|
| 0:48:47| You know, we had a meeting recently where we had the Greater Knox Black Chamber come in and speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2927)|
| 0:48:54| And I think we heard that also. I mean, the same that that it's not been the most friendly appearance organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2934)|
| 0:49:03| There's a lot of things that we're trying to do. And in the way that Mike and his team are to have designed the new board structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2943)|
| 0:49:12| trying to focus on getting more small business owners and more African-American businesses in, I think is going to help with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2952)|
| 0:49:22| But we need help. The chamber and Mike's part of his vision is we don't have to be in charge of everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2962)|
| 0:49:32| We don't want the chamber. We don't want credit for things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2972)|
| 0:49:37| And people in the past have said, as Mike did his first 200 meetings with business leaders in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2977)|
| 0:49:44| the part of the rhetoric was, well, the chamber just tries to get credit for everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2984)|
| 0:49:49| So Mike is trying real hard to make sure that, you know, we want to be the conveners and help collaborate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2989)|
| 0:49:56| We don't definitely don't need credit for everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2996)|
| 0:49:59| And so anything that any of you all can can help direct us in a way that would be better received in the in the black community or Hispanic community or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=2999)|
| 0:50:11| I know Mike and his team would love to have any of that information so they can help build that a better chamber in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3011)|
| 0:50:20| And then you thank you for those comments. Are you referring to the Tennessee Black Chamber of Commerce?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3020)|
| 0:50:28| No, ma'am, to the greater Knoxville Black Chamber. That is it's starting to build up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3028)|
| 0:50:34| It's trying to build. So there's a organization, Greater Knox Black Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3034)|
| 0:50:40| And and I apologize, Mike, what is it's the greater Knox County Black Chamber of Commerce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3040)|
| 0:50:51| And so we had a meeting. It was brought to our attention that they're starting this organization to to try and help the black community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3051)|
| 0:51:00| And and how can the Knoxville chamber work with partner with the greater Knox County Black Chamber to to achieve both goals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3060)|
| 0:51:13| Obviously, the the black chamber is a new organization, doesn't have all the resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3073)|
| 0:51:18| So is there a way that we could help? And quite honestly, and just to be blunt, and I don't know if this is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3078)|
| 0:51:27| But, you know, the the. We didn't want to come in and say, OK, let's try and take over that chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3087)|
| 0:51:36| I mean, that's that's not the goal. And Mike is very sensitive to to that. How do you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3096)|
| 0:51:40| So how do you partner with the black chamber to to build a better community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3100)|
| 0:51:47| And there there were people that said, you know, they they just we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3107)|
| 0:51:52| Why do you divide the resources? Let's just bring it all together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3112)|
| 0:51:55| And that wasn't necessarily the thing that that we thought was the best opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3115)|
| 0:52:00| So we wanted to hear where they're trying to go with that. OK, well, I look forward to hearing from them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3120)|
| 0:52:06| But at the end of the day, we do look to the Knoxville chamber to be to be the lead at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3126)|
| 0:52:13| This is what we have you guys for. You guys collaborate at your will, as you feel is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3133)|
| 0:52:20| But at this juncture, I look to you all as the leaders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3140)|
| 0:52:25| And again, I look forward to more conversation in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3145)|
| 0:52:29| But thank you for this presentation and taking the time today. So that's all the questions and comments I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3149)|
| 0:52:35| Colleagues, do you guys have any additional questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3155)|
| 0:52:39| Councilman Testament. Hey, I have a couple of questions and thank you for that presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3159)|
| 0:52:46| It was great. The first is I'm just curious as you're looking at recruiting new business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3166)|
| 0:52:53| What are what have been some of the hurdles that you've encountered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3173)|
| 0:52:57| Be it amenities we might not have as a city that companies are looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3177)|
| 0:53:04| You know, I don't know if there's any consistency as far as I'm just curious what any of those hurdles might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3184)|
| 0:53:13| OK. Yeah. Great question. So historically, we've had hurdles around the areas of lack of product in our community and product in my world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3193)|
| 0:53:27| Is land that is prepped and ready for businesses to locate on or existing buildings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3207)|
| 0:53:34| The land we are much better off than we were even two years ago in this community with with our partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3214)|
| 0:53:41| development corporation bringing on two new business parks as we speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3221)|
| 0:53:46| One in Midway Road, one in Carnes out behind Carnes High School, existing buildings were still very tight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3226)|
| 0:53:54| I had a conversation yesterday with a developer looking at doing some potential speculative industrial buildings out in Forks of the River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3234)|
| 0:54:03| Actually, on the property that's in the city of Knoxville, there are some little pieces of Forks of the River that actually sit within the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3243)|
| 0:54:10| And there are respect buildings being developed now off of Middlebrook Pike at Ed Schaus that is Millbrook Farms property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3250)|
| 0:54:19| That's bringing some some buildings into the market, as well as the Joyce and Safety building out of Mid Park Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3259)|
| 0:54:28| It's about a 300,000 square foot building that's being redeveloped for potential industrial reuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3268)|
| 0:54:34| So there are there things are certainly improving along the lines of the product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3274)|
| 0:54:39| Other things that we've been named on historically have been the cost of flying in and out of the Tyson Airport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3279)|
| 0:54:46| And that's something we continue to lean into. And, you know, pandemic has changed a lot in the aviation travel industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3286)|
| 0:54:55| But it is still a very active discussion with in our partnership with the airport authority and their teams out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3295)|
| 0:55:02| Oh, Mike, you had something. Yeah, I just want to test them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3302)|
| 0:55:05| I just want to add one thing that we definitely hear a lot about from my conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3305)|
| 0:55:11| So I don't want to paint Doug with this as well. And there's a term that that Governor Bredesen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3311)|
| 0:55:17| you mayor of Nashville saying you need civic furniture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3317)|
| 0:55:22| You've got a house, you got a great house, but it doesn't have that furniture inside of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3322)|
| 0:55:26| It looks empty. We have got to increase our civic furniture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3326)|
| 0:55:30| We have got to have those things that I hate using this term, especially because I'm old and not cool, but we've got to be cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3330)|
| 0:55:38| And so there's things that have to happen that because that drives and keeps the talent and the talent is what keeps the companies and drives the company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3338)|
| 0:55:47| So so that's another piece that we as a community, as a region have to address as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3347)|
| 0:55:53| And when you talk about the furniture, what I mean, you know, I'll give you an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3353)|
| 0:56:00| So and this is a tough one for us to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3360)|
| 0:56:04| So one of the meetings Daniel mentioned, we had about 250 meetings when I first got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3364)|
| 0:56:08| One of those meetings was it was a group of the Urban League's young professionals, young professional committee and talking to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3368)|
| 0:56:15| And as well as the LGBTQ plus community, they are looking for social life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3375)|
| 0:56:22| They're looking for significant others and that it doesn't doesn't exist here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3382)|
| 0:56:27| There's not enough of those folks. And so we've got to do things that draw people to want to stay here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3387)|
| 0:56:33| We put out a part of that this week that the last 10 years are 25 to 54 year old population has grown by half a percent in a decade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3393)|
| 0:56:45| So those people who fill jobs, start companies, buy homes, have kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3405)|
| 0:56:49| We have done about less than 300 people growth in 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3409)|
| 0:56:53| While our neighbors in Chattanooga have done by 4 percent, Nashville has grown by 15 percent and Raleigh has grown by almost 20 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3413)|
| 0:57:02| Right. And that's that's really an area that we have to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3422)|
| 0:57:07| Yeah, we have had these conversations. Good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3427)|
| 0:57:09| My other question is with COVID, you know, we hear some chatter about businesses vacating the brick and mortar because they've learned that remote workforce can actually work for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3429)|
| 0:57:24| Curious from your perspective, is that, you know, how much truth, how much myth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3444)|
| 0:57:29| And then with that said, does that create opportunity back to Doug's point about real estate or, you know, that type of thing that to, you know, again, close that gap of, you know, should these businesses, you know, vacate and move remote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3449)|
| 0:57:49| I think the answer to that question is it's too early to tell still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3469)|
| 0:57:54| There's been a lot of studies and reports, and I got one from the Urban Lane Institute the other day that's sitting on my desk that I haven't read yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3474)|
| 0:58:01| And I wish I had. Would have sounded really smart for this discussion here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3481)|
| 0:58:07| That being said, we've I've seen a couple of our attraction projects that were heavy, heavy office that just paused and said, you know what, we're going to we're going to circle back in six months and see what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3487)|
| 0:58:20| And I've got another very active office related project that's looking at the city of Knoxville that is is full steam ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3500)|
| 0:58:27| Now, their temporary ramp up might look a little bit different, but all indications are that they're still looking for a permanent spot to put a bunch of people in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3507)|
| 0:58:39| So it's a little it's a little all over the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3519)|
| 0:58:44| We had a meeting today with the CEO who has an operation here that we're trying to get them to consolidate their operations across the country here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3524)|
| 0:58:54| And he said their business model is they're going to have some kind of office presence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3534)|
| 0:59:01| What that office looks like and the square footage needed to do it may change, but there will be real estate involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3541)|
| 0:59:08| And so I think Doug makes an excellent point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3548)|
| 0:59:12| It's still it's still in the in the figuring out stages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3552)|
| 0:59:15| And until we get through the pandemic, it's probably going to stay that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3555)|
| 0:59:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3559)|
| 0:59:20| And that's why I know it's still, you know, yet to be seen and shaking out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3560)|
| 0:59:25| But as far as kind of looking at that as potential solutions and challenges before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3565)|
| 0:59:30| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3570)|
| 0:59:33| Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| You've been patiently waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3575)|
| 0:59:36| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3576)|
| 0:59:37| No, no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3577)|
| 0:59:38| Some of my questions were answered in the interim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3578)|
| 0:59:41| So it works out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3581)|
| 0:59:45| I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3585)|
| 0:59:47| You know, recently, we recruited an e-commerce business to our community through the Project Malibu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3587)|
| 0:59:56| And I was curious in your conversations with our local businesses, if there's any if any concern has been expressed with the expansion of an e-commerce service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3596)|
| 1:00:10| Forget the service department moving in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3610)|
| 1:00:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3614)|
| 1:00:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3615)|
| 1:00:16| So, Councilmember Parker, I have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3616)|
| 1:00:19| I have not heard any concern about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3619)|
| 1:00:22| I won't speak for my colleagues sitting here in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3622)|
| 1:00:25| I don't know if you guys have had any discussions about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3625)|
| 1:00:28| But from an economic development vice president perspective, I've not had anybody reach out with with issues related to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3628)|
| 1:00:36| Actually, for me, the opposite is, is the business community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3636)|
| 1:00:40| And it's, you know, we're talking about small, simple size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3640)|
| 1:00:43| So I don't want to mislead you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3643)|
| 1:00:46| Have been very positive because they were concerned about what the prop that property may become and and and some of the challenges that may cause in that part of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3646)|
| 1:00:56| So, with what the developer is has has proposed, they're very happy with it and look forward to the jobs and create.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3656)|
| 1:01:05| And then my other question was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3665)|
| 1:01:09| When I dean companies to recruit to our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3669)|
| 1:01:16| Are you taking into consideration our sustainability goals of the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3676)|
| 1:01:24| We are, in fact, that that's one of our, our talking points when we're speaking to companies that are looking to locate here is, you know, you're if you come to Knoxville, you're coming to a community that values sustainability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3684)|
| 1:01:37| And, you know, in our strategic platforms speak to that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3697)|
| 1:01:41| The fact that we've got a platform around power in power is probably the one that's got a lot of sustainability place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3701)|
| 1:01:50| We've got an active project right now, but based in Canada that has been working with every that we're talking to the city about incorporating some of their technology potentially in the public works building for the police and fire department in North Knoxville as a potential pilot to demonstrate their technologies and potentially locate some manufacturing jobs in the city associated with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3710)|
| 1:02:14| But it certainly is a is a talking point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3734)|
| 1:02:18| And Councilwoman, I have a member of my team who actually sits on the mayor's business climate council and she reports back to our infrastructure council that's made up of volunteer leaders so that we keep that a two way dialogue and keep abreast of those developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3738)|
| 1:02:42| Wonderful. And then my final question was in regards to black owned businesses in my community and particularly small black owned businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3762)|
| 1:02:56| I've been in constant discussion with business owners in the community and asking about their concerns and what they want to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3776)|
| 1:03:06| And I want to echo some of the things that Vice Mayor McKenzie stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3786)|
| 1:03:12| There is a lack of trust with the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3792)|
| 1:03:17| And it seems that you all are aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3797)|
| 1:03:20| And that will need some work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3800)|
| 1:03:23| One thing I wanted to emphasize, though, in terms of small businesses, there have even been complaints in the community that some of those dollars that have typically flown through those CDFIs are not reaching our small businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3803)|
| 1:03:46| And so even with an organization like the Urban League tends to, you know, provide support that doesn't even trickle down to those small businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3826)|
| 1:03:57| So even partnering with those on an even more grassroots level, I think, will bring more benefit to a larger segment of our of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3837)|
| 1:04:10| We agree. Actually, one of the components of the access to capital strategy is going to be the look at the CDFIs, both the local ones and the state one, because they don't get the request to expend the dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3850)|
| 1:04:25| And so it may be more of an exposure issue, making sure that businesses are able to even there, although they're minimal, there are some qualification things that you have to get through the micro loans, the CDFIs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3865)|
| 1:04:38| So we absolutely want to help those businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3878)|
| 1:04:41| It doesn't do us any good to have to give that money back to the feds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3881)|
| 1:04:45| We want to get it to the people who need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3885)|
| 1:04:49| Thank you so much. And my final statement is I had a great meeting with Mike Odom when I first joined city council, and it was refreshing to hear what your priorities would be in the upcoming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3889)|
| 1:05:04| And I knew that we would not be fighting as much as I expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3904)|
| 1:05:08| So I'm glad we're on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3908)|
| 1:05:11| I'm glad the Chamber of Commerce has switched to this local focus and less on the recruitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3911)|
| 1:05:17| So I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3917)|
| 1:05:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3918)|
| 1:05:19| But don't say that too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3919)|
| 1:05:20| You're going to ruin our reputation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3920)|
| 1:05:24| And Tom, Council Member Smith, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3924)|
| 1:05:27| Oh, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3927)|
| 1:05:28| Tommy's what I was given at birth, so I'll stick with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3928)|
| 1:05:31| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3931)|
| 1:05:32| I wanted to compliment you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3932)|
| 1:05:34| My day job involves strategic plans, and so this is one of the better ones I've seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3934)|
| 1:05:40| We didn't cover the platforms, which are the five industry types, the verticals that you are focused on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3940)|
| 1:05:47| And I want to commend you all and the board in particular because, as simple as it sounds, one of the things I've seen after plan, after plan, after plan in this community is our unwillingness to pick some industries and stick to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3947)|
| 1:06:02| And so I think I told you a measure of success for me is that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3962)|
| 1:06:08| So you all did an inventory of what industries we have here, what ecosystems make up those five, and commit to those five and say, because we've named them, we can pursue growth in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3968)|
| 1:06:23| And hopefully five years from now we don't have five different ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3983)|
| 1:06:27| But I want to commend you also because naming them allows us to do things that take time, such as three things particularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3987)|
| 1:06:36| One is to support local businesses in those ecosystems so that they're strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=3996)|
| 1:06:41| And the two is to attract businesses in those industries elsewhere to come here because that ecosystem is strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4001)|
| 1:06:51| And the third thing, which is really important, is to train and retain talent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4011)|
| 1:06:58| And so earlier this week I was able to join a guy's name, Keith Wilson, who's director of career and technology education for Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4018)|
| 1:07:08| The regional director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4028)|
| 1:07:10| He just got an award for his work recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4030)|
| 1:07:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4033)|
| 1:07:14| So that third part, once you have a strong, supportive, you're supporting existing businesses, you're trying to go attract new ones, you have to develop a pipeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4034)|
| 1:07:25| And so the CTE accreditation and connection to workforce development in those five industries, I think that whole picture is really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4045)|
| 1:07:36| And so just somebody who does this every day, I just commend you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4056)|
| 1:07:41| And stick with them, please, because it's the whiplash that keeps us from moving forward and establishing some type of brand that we can take elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4061)|
| 1:07:49| So really thank you all for making that commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4069)|
| 1:07:55| Don't go anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4075)|
| 1:07:56| So thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4076)|
| 1:07:57| Thank you for your kind words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4077)|
| 1:07:59| We do want to reiterate, though, that the Path to Prosperity Strategic Vision really came from you all and your peers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4079)|
| 1:08:05| All we did was write it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4085)|
| 1:08:07| Our job now is to figure out how to execute it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4087)|
| 1:08:09| And so when we created the strategic platforms, as we've said before, we're no longer thinking 18 to 24 months in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4089)|
| 1:08:17| We're thinking 18 to 24 years in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4097)|
| 1:08:19| And so five years from now, we won't know if we've gone on the right path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4099)|
| 1:08:24| It's going to take much more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4104)|
| 1:08:27| And as Amy reminds me, I've got 13 years and I'm out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4107)|
| 1:08:30| I'm retiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4110)|
| 1:08:31| So we're not changing anything for 13 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4111)|
| 1:08:34| But, you know, along those lines, it felt good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4114)|
| 1:08:36| You know, I think I joined Doug a couple weeks ago in pitching a company in Chicago along those lines with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4116)|
| 1:08:43| So I think, yeah, just keep going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4123)|
| 1:08:47| Thanks for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4127)|
| 1:08:49| Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4129)|
| 1:08:52| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4132)|
| 1:08:53| Thanks for elaborating on where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4133)|
| 1:08:56| These are obviously odd times and you guys are staying busy and attracting folks and working on the pathway that's laid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4136)|
| 1:09:06| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4146)|
| 1:09:08| You talked about the four legs of the stool, I think is what you called it, but skills, child care, affordable housing and transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4148)|
| 1:09:18| We talk a lot about many of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4158)|
| 1:09:21| But I specifically want to ask you about the child care component because I think, you know, I know where we go for the skills, the job training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4161)|
| 1:09:29| I know where we go for the affordable housing and the transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4169)|
| 1:09:32| The child care I think is a little bit more difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4172)|
| 1:09:34| And you said something about a survey and child care also came up in a conversation, a meeting I had recently with Chris Letso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4174)|
| 1:09:43| So I'm curious, you know, what can you elaborate on for us on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4183)|
| 1:09:49| Because I know that when you talk about that demographic that we haven't grown in, child care is something that's important to that demographic and getting those folks in the workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4189)|
| 1:09:58| It's key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4198)|
| 1:10:00| And I want Amy to address this, but I do want to say the report, it was a report that I mentioned earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4200)|
| 1:10:05| It's a statewide group, and I apologize, I don't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4205)|
| 1:10:09| It's got some five-letter acronym that I never remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4209)|
| 1:10:13| And so we participated financially for them to come in and do an assessment, not only by state but by region of our child care, both the accessibility, the affordability, and the quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4213)|
| 1:10:30| And so we have not, it is not part of our business plan this year just because we got to a point where we had to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4230)|
| 1:10:37| But it is something that we've talked about that we're going to bring to our board for our business plan next year so we can start to address it in a more meaningful way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4237)|
| 1:10:44| But I will ask Amy to take it from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4244)|
| 1:10:48| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4248)|
| 1:10:49| And Councilwoman, the organization is Tennesseans for Quality Early Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4249)|
| 1:10:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4256)|
| 1:10:57| Did that report have support from all the big four urban chambers in Tennessee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4257)|
| 1:11:04| That group has since expanded to include a lot of the larger suburban areas as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4264)|
| 1:11:10| We've been meeting monthly beginning this fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4270)|
| 1:11:14| We are going to put child care on our legislative agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4274)|
| 1:11:20| I don't know if we'll get anything this year, any kind of relief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4280)|
| 1:11:26| It's very multifaceted issue around quality, the whole efficacy of the three-star, five-star program, how funds are dispersed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4286)|
| 1:11:39| There's a lot of moving parts there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4299)|
| 1:11:42| But I do believe it's something that is a larger group we're going to focus on statewide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4302)|
| 1:11:48| And if I could, we talk a lot about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4308)|
| 1:11:51| We're talking about the American Job Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4311)|
| 1:11:53| The American Job Center, part of their funding, the funding that they provide for job seekers is child care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4313)|
| 1:11:59| But as we were looking through it, it's a reimbursement mechanism now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4319)|
| 1:12:04| So you pay for the child care and then you get reimbursed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4324)|
| 1:12:07| Well, if you're unemployed, you don't have the money to put forward first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4327)|
| 1:12:12| And so that's one of the things that we talked to them about is that that system is backwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4332)|
| 1:12:17| You know, you've got to we need to give them the voucher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4337)|
| 1:12:20| We've got to get them the money first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4340)|
| 1:12:22| Then they can go get the child care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4342)|
| 1:12:23| Then they can go get the skills development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4343)|
| 1:12:25| They can go do the interviewing and they can get the job and get the career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4345)|
| 1:12:28| And so when we talk about it, these are the kind of things that we've got to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4348)|
| 1:12:32| Well, you can give people money all day long to pay for child care if there's no place to get the child care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4352)|
| 1:12:37| It's another huge component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4357)|
| 1:12:39| I mean, I left the workforce when I expected my second child for that reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4359)|
| 1:12:46| My spouse can't just call in to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4366)|
| 1:12:49| You know, when you have kids, you I mean, it's just super challenging to keep people in the workforce when they can't depend on child care outside of, you know, 7 a.m. to 5 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4369)|
| 1:13:00| And we have very few infant spots in this market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4380)|
| 1:13:04| So it's a major it's a major barrier is finding reliable, safe, quality child care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4384)|
| 1:13:13| Even if you're willing to pay for it, it's not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4393)|
| 1:13:16| And it's gotten accentuated through the pandemic as more people have lost their jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4396)|
| 1:13:23| But also I think as schools close, as kids have to be have to get have been quarantined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4403)|
| 1:13:32| And so it's even highlighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4412)|
| 1:13:34| One of Amy's team told me a story about someone she's working with who actually had to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4414)|
| 1:13:40| So she left her job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4420)|
| 1:13:44| No, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4424)|
| 1:13:46| She had to pay the child care provider to keep the spot open in case her child got quarantined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4426)|
| 1:13:56| So she's paying in case she needs the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4436)|
| 1:14:00| And that's obviously, you know, problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4440)|
| 1:14:04| And I'll just say this is in our market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4444)|
| 1:14:06| My sister lives in Aiken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4446)|
| 1:14:08| Well, she lives in North Augusta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4448)|
| 1:14:10| But she works in Aiken, South Carolina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4450)|
| 1:14:12| And I think what I would like to say to everyone is child care is almost as rare as hen's teeth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4452)|
| 1:14:18| There certainly aren't enough spots under kindergarten for what we have for our demographics and our workforce needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4458)|
| 1:14:26| But the child care my sister has her kids in, they had to quarantine and shut down for two weeks because of an exposure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4466)|
| 1:14:33| And they said if they had one more, if they had to do it again, they will close forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4473)|
| 1:14:39| So I think what we'll see is we don't have enough child care and we may see that we lose some child care centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4479)|
| 1:14:46| A lot of our child care is associated with churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4486)|
| 1:14:49| And so their, you know, foundation might be able to keep the doors open and keep them going after we're past the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4489)|
| 1:14:56| But we may find we're in worse shape than we were, obviously, in a lot of different areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4496)|
| 1:15:03| So I'm just concerned about that as one of the criteria to be able to provide workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4503)|
| 1:15:09| And, you know, I came here by way of spending eight years in Indianapolis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4509)|
| 1:15:13| And, of course, when you get employed someplace like Lilly Pharmaceuticals and they have this wonderful child care center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4513)|
| 1:15:19| And like here, Covenant has a child care center affiliated with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4519)|
| 1:15:23| We just don't have a lot of employers with that kind of perk, basically, so they can keep their employees employed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4523)|
| 1:15:33| So I think that's going to be a struggle for us moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4533)|
| 1:15:38| So I just wanted to point that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4538)|
| 1:15:40| And I appreciate that that's being looked into, even if it's not a priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4540)|
| 1:15:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4543)|
| 1:15:44| It would be a priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4544)|
| 1:15:45| Don't you worry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4545)|
| 1:15:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4547)|
| 1:15:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4548)|
| 1:15:49| Council members, thank you so much for the dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4549)|
| 1:15:52| Do we have any closing remarks from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4552)|
| 1:15:54| Because we do have Deputy Chief Welch ready to present to us on tips and pilots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4554)|
| 1:16:01| That's probably going to take a bit of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4561)|
| 1:16:03| Are there any other comments before we let our NOx chamber partners drop from the call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4563)|
| 1:16:13| Like Councilman Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4573)|
| 1:16:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4577)|
| 1:16:18| This is something I'm probably going to be calling you folks on, is just the broader issue of industrial parks in Knoxville and where to locate heavy and light industrial businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4578)|
| 1:16:30| You know, as Knoxville was very young, they were kind of placed willy-nilly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4590)|
| 1:16:35| But as Knoxville has grown and we have residents, residential neighborhoods that have grown, I would just like at some point to talk to you guys and get a really good overview of what the situation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4595)|
| 1:16:48| With industrial parks, because, you know, we need appropriate places when people want to come in and do business and provide jobs here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4608)|
| 1:16:59| And I guess I just need a little bit of communication about what we can do as far as placement of new businesses or if there's existing industrial activities here in Knoxville that might benefit actually from being in another location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4619)|
| 1:17:18| So expect a call from me just to kind of get a general idea and what your thoughts are on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4638)|
| 1:17:26| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4646)|
| 1:17:27| And Councilmember Thomas, I'm happy to give you Todd Napier's number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4647)|
| 1:17:30| No, I'm just kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4650)|
| 1:17:31| I'm just kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4651)|
| 1:17:32| We're happy to talk to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4652)|
| 1:17:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4656)|
| 1:17:37| Thank you, Councilmember Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4657)|
| 1:17:38| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4658)|
| 1:17:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4661)|
| 1:17:42| If not, Chamber members, thank you so much for your time and really great presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4662)|
| 1:17:47| And I'll be following up as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4667)|
| 1:17:51| And you're welcome to drop from the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4671)|
| 1:17:53| I think Doug still is going to be part of the next conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4673)|
| 1:17:56| I'll go to my office and rejoin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4676)|
| 1:17:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4678)|
| 1:17:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4679)|
| 1:18:00| Thank you, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4680)|
| 1:18:01| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4681)|
| 1:18:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4682)|
| 1:18:03| Deputy Chief Welch, are you with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4683)|
| 1:18:06| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4686)|
| 1:18:07| Thanks so much, Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4687)|
| 1:18:09| And good evening, I guess now, Councilmembers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4689)|
| 1:18:12| I'm really pleased to be here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4692)|
| 1:18:14| I'm going to be making some introductions in just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4694)|
| 1:18:17| I'm not your featured speaker, so you'll be hearing from others about TIFs and pilots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4697)|
| 1:18:25| This is a really good marriage between the presentation from the Chamber and, you know, I just want to reiterate a little bit of what I heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4705)|
| 1:18:37| And I'm so pleased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| I think, Vice Mayor, you hit the nail on the head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4719)|
| 1:18:43| The Knoxville Chamber is our primary economic prosperity partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4723)|
| 1:18:49| And, you know, part of that expectation is that they're collaborating across the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4729)|
| 1:18:54| But really, it's important when we think about an economic development, economic prosperity strategy, that we have a lot of alignment and collaboration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4734)|
| 1:19:04| And so we really see the Knoxville Chamber as our primary convener of that collaboration and leader in an economic prosperity strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4744)|
| 1:19:14| And then, Councilman Smith, I couldn't agree with you more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4754)|
| 1:19:18| I'm sort of a planning nerd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4758)|
| 1:19:20| It's hard to know where you're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4760)|
| 1:19:23| If you don't have a plan and sort of an end goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4763)|
| 1:19:26| And I think that Mike and his team have done a really exceptional job in creating a fantastic framework that is flexible and inclusive, but also provides us with direction as a community, how to move forward towards even greater economic prosperity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4766)|
| 1:19:47| And then, Ms. Parker, Councilwoman Parker, I appreciated what you said as well about, you know, it's nice to have an enlightened leader at the Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4787)|
| 1:19:58| And at the risk of even further damaging Mike Odom's reputation in the community, I will just pile on a little bit and say that I feel that we're really fortunate to have an enlightened leader who is willing to face the hard questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4798)|
| 1:20:15| We're not doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4815)|
| 1:20:17| We have a lot of room for improvement in our community when it comes to economic prosperity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4817)|
| 1:20:21| And I think that the Chamber is up to the task of doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4821)|
| 1:20:25| So I want to thank Mike and his team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4825)|
| 1:20:27| As we think about our path to prosperity and economic prosperity, we have a variety of tools that we use to help us get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4827)|
| 1:20:37| And one of the more complex but important set of tools is tax abatement and pilots and TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4837)|
| 1:20:44| So my sense is, because we're trying to keep this workshop to two hours, I know how important all of your time is, that gives us only about 40 minutes to get into some nuts and bolts on pilots and TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4844)|
| 1:20:57| And so I'm going to kick it over to a group of people that are involved in this, but none probably more critically important in my role, because I partner with him a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4857)|
| 1:21:11| He's our preeminent expert on pilots and TIFs, not just in Knoxville, but really across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4871)|
| 1:21:19| Mark Mamentoff, who's an attorney with Bassberry and Sims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4879)|
| 1:21:23| He is really the leading attorney in the state and probably beyond when it comes to public finance and economic incentives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4883)|
| 1:21:32| So he's going to be sort of the meat and potatoes of our time with you on pilots and TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4892)|
| 1:21:37| But just to give you a sense of some of the others on the phone, Susan Jeannot, who's our director of finance, as you know, and Boyce Evans, the deputy director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4897)|
| 1:21:48| Rebecca Jane Justice, I think you see her on there, who's my deputy chief of economic and community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4908)|
| 1:21:55| Christina McGrimes from our law department is on, as well as Becky Wade, who will be providing an example of pilots that are used to promote affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4915)|
| 1:22:09| Todd Napier is the CEO of the Development Corp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4929)|
| 1:22:13| And Ben Bentley, the CEO of KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4933)|
| 1:22:16| All of these folks play a role in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4936)|
| 1:22:19| So I just wanted to make sure that you know that they're all on the phone as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4939)|
| 1:22:24| I'm going to kick it over to Mark, who is probably going to burn our ears with his fast talk over the next half hour or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4944)|
| 1:22:32| So Mark Mametoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4952)|
| 1:22:36| Thank you, Stephanie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4956)|
| 1:22:37| And do I need to share my screen or will someone will be adding my slides here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4957)|
| 1:22:45| Mark, I've added you as a co-host, so you can share your screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4965)|
| 1:22:52| One second, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4972)|
| 1:23:14| All right, guys, of course, when you're wanting something to pop up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4994)|
| 1:23:18| Let me dive in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4998)|
| 1:23:19| And I'm going to while that's loading, I'm going to dive into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=4999)|
| 1:23:22| So thank you, Stephanie is always very kind and diplomatic, as you all have seen me a number of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5002)|
| 1:23:30| I'm primarily a bond lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5010)|
| 1:23:31| But years and years ago, I got engaged in the incentive business for better or for worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5011)|
| 1:23:40| The. Much of my work is all over the state, but the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5020)|
| 1:23:51| I think I can do it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5031)|
| 1:24:06| Sorry, guys, it's not sharing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5046)|
| 1:24:14| You see that now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5054)|
| 1:24:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5056)|
| 1:24:17| OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5057)|
| 1:24:18| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5058)|
| 1:24:20| So Stephanie has asked me to talk about pilots and tips and to give you a little bit of background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5060)|
| 1:24:26| And I it's very difficult to do this in a half an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5066)|
| 1:24:30| I am going to speak quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5070)|
| 1:24:31| I thought Mike Odom being from Louisiana would speak more slowly, but he spoke pretty quickly, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5071)|
| 1:24:37| And ironically, my family comes from very near where his family's from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5077)|
| 1:24:40| So you're going to hear two Cajuns here talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5080)|
| 1:24:45| So the pilots and tips are just local property tax incentives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5085)|
| 1:24:52| There are ways, tools that you guys can use to to try to make things happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5092)|
| 1:25:00| Pilots and tips generally do not involve sales tax component at all, not the state portion or the local portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5100)|
| 1:25:07| Having said that, our downtown tourism development zone is a sales tax incentive district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5107)|
| 1:25:13| But we really don't have time to cover it or its history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5113)|
| 1:25:17| But again, if you would like to hear that and how it got enacted, I would be delighted to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5117)|
| 1:25:24| The. Stephanie asked me to do a brief history of when we started using tips and pilots, not so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5124)|
| 1:25:33| And I got to admit, I had a really good time getting on my computer and going back, really, 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5133)|
| 1:25:43| And some of you, I mean, maybe you'll have been around for a while. And, you know, Victor was elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5143)|
| 1:25:48| Ash elected mayor in eighty seven. But for 13 years, we really did not move forward with incentives to get downtown moving along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5148)|
| 1:26:02| And I started looking back at a lot of my old emails and files and really in late 2000, 2001 is when things really started to take off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5162)|
| 1:26:12| You know, ironically, in 2000 was the first big pilot done here locally inside the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5172)|
| 1:26:19| And that, believe it or not, was to keep the new Sentinel from moving their headquarters outside the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5179)|
| 1:26:26| That was a redevelopment area on the top of the hill that you see the Knox News building and to incentivize the new Sentinel to locate their headquarters here in downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5186)|
| 1:26:39| And then in 2001, after they sold their downtown lot on which the Marriott Courtyard and Residence Center are located now, they were granted a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5199)|
| 1:26:49| Well, at the time, the city did not have an active industrial development board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5209)|
| 1:26:54| I actually went back and looked. The city formed an industrial development board, and we'll talk about industrial development boards in a minute, back in 1960.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5214)|
| 1:27:01| And it basically became defunct after Randy Tyree was mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5221)|
| 1:27:06| It was largely somewhat of a political board, and the board had gone into bad standing and had gone defunct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5226)|
| 1:27:15| We created it, recreated it during this period to offer this incentive to the Knoxville New Sentinel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5235)|
| 1:27:23| Ironically, around the same time, downtown redevelopment became much more of a focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5243)|
| 1:27:28| David Dewhurst, who as many of you all know, David, was one of the early pioneers, and we've been blessed with a number of very good developers downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5248)|
| 1:27:35| But David came with the Emporium building and, as many of you all know, the city leased a couple of the lower floors to help make that project successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5255)|
| 1:27:44| But David also asked for the first downtown pilot for that project, and we used the city industrial development board to get that accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5264)|
| 1:27:55| So, that was a big part of downtown redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5275)|
| 1:27:59| And we used the recently recreated city industrial development board to get that done and provide an incentive for the Emporium building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5279)|
| 1:28:09| And shortly thereafter, condos became something that people saw as a big part of downtown redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5289)|
| 1:28:17| And condos and pilots don't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5297)|
| 1:28:20| So, that was a big part of downtown redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5300)|
| 1:28:23| And then, as you all know, we've been using tax increment financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5303)|
| 1:28:28| Nashville had been using tax increment financing for many of its larger buildings, and I was representing KCDC and still work with KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5308)|
| 1:28:39| Ben Bentley, I think, is on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5319)|
| 1:28:41| And at the time, I was working primarily with Bill Lyons, who was our board chair at the time, and Alvin Nance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5321)|
| 1:28:49| And the first deal that we closed was for the Fire Street Lofts, which was to provide tax increment financing to support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5329)|
| 1:28:57| I look back at those documents and cringe at all the mistakes that I made, but it looks like the Fire Street Lofts TIFs, I was looking at the recent calculations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5337)|
| 1:29:08| it looks like it will be paid off here very shortly if it's not already been paid off with this year's taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5348)|
| 1:29:13| And so, that's obviously encouraging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5353)|
| 1:29:21| So, pilots are typically used, historically, pilots were used to attract industry to our state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5361)|
| 1:29:27| The first big pilots in Tennessee were done to attract the Saturn plant at Spring Hill, which is obviously now a general GM plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5367)|
| 1:29:36| Nissan got large pilots to come to Smyrna, and as recently, obviously, Volkswagen has had very generous pilots to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5376)|
| 1:29:45| But pilots are ubiquitous across the state, attracting industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5385)|
| 1:29:50| In Blount County, we've assisted them with huge pilots for Benzo and Alcoa and now Arconic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5390)|
| 1:29:56| And throughout most of East Tennessee, most industry has been attracted by using pilots as the incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5396)|
| 1:30:05| Only in recent years have we been using pilots to promote low-income housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5405)|
| 1:30:10| You see pilots frequently used to support low-income housing that is supported by low-income housing tax credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5410)|
| 1:30:17| There is very unusual rules that apply to how low-income housing tax credit deals are taxed under state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5417)|
| 1:30:25| I personally think that those rules were not well-designed by the Board of Equalization because it basically penalizes a low-income housing tax credit developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5425)|
| 1:30:35| But they won a series of cases that, and as a result, the Comptroller's Office working with us has developed legislation that makes it fairly easy to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5435)|
| 1:30:50| I'll explain why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5450)|
| 1:30:52| Pilots for low-income housing tax credit deals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5452)|
| 1:30:55| You know, retail, you see a lot of pilots for retail around the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5455)|
| 1:30:59| We don't do a lot of that in Knox County or Knoxville in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5459)|
| 1:31:02| But in places like Memphis, where they threw a 20-year pilot lease at the IKEA when they came there, Nashville was prepared to do much the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5462)|
| 1:31:12| But there are a few retailers that can command pilots in the big cities and in smaller communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5472)|
| 1:31:18| They will use pilots to attract retail that they're trying to develop their retail base because so much of retail has aggregated due to e-commerce into bigger markets like ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5478)|
| 1:31:29| So we don't really need to do it in places like Turkey Creek and stuff, but we need to be aware of it around East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5489)|
| 1:31:37| It's a fairly frequent phenomenon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5497)|
| 1:31:40| You wouldn't be surprised maybe how many tips and pilots we've done around East Tennessee to support food cities and publics and things like that, that smaller communities really need retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5500)|
| 1:31:51| And then we're seeing a lot of pilots being done downtown to support mixed-use projects that have commercial and then moderate-income apartments on the top usually and some not-so-moderate income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5511)|
| 1:32:08| But those are typically where you see pilots being used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5528)|
| 1:32:12| TIFFs, however, are almost exclusively used to support redevelopment projects, although you do see them to some extent in supporting retail projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5532)|
| 1:32:22| We do a lot of TIFFs for hotels in smaller communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5542)|
| 1:32:26| You're trying to attract national-brand hotels like Hampton Inns and things like that to their communities because a lack of a national-brand hotel can really hurt them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5546)|
| 1:32:35| Here in Knox County and Knoxville, we don't have those issues, so we primarily have used TIFFs to promote redevelopment in our downtown and ancillary areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5555)|
| 1:32:45| And you see them, as I mentioned, primarily with condominiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5565)|
| 1:32:51| And again, I'll explain why you see that primarily there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5571)|
| 1:32:54| You do sometimes see these for projects that involve a lot of infrastructure from developers, and those have mainly been done outside the city limits in places along Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5574)|
| 1:33:07| There's recently one that was approved along Oak Ridge Highway because of inadequate public infrastructure to facilitate a retail development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5587)|
| 1:33:18| So if you're a developer, how do you choose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5598)|
| 1:33:22| You often say – I mean, a pilot and a TIFF, I think people often don't realize that basically they're the same thing in terms of they're basically giving a developer the benefit of the incremental taxes they create.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5602)|
| 1:33:37| In a pilot, you're giving them the benefit by abating those taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5617)|
| 1:33:41| And with a TIFF, you're giving them the benefit by essentially allocating the incremental taxes they create back to the Industrial Development Board where the Industrial Development Board or KCDC for a redevelopment project can essentially monetize the income stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5621)|
| 1:33:59| In other words, they can borrow against it, thereby creating additional funds to support a project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5639)|
| 1:34:05| So after 2017, when the federal tax laws were rewritten, TIFFs became somewhat less attractive to a lot of developers because the way the tax code was rewritten then is that a TIFF is effectively a grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5645)|
| 1:34:19| The governmental entity, be it KCDC or the Industrial Development Board, borrows against the incremental property tax stream and grants the money to the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5659)|
| 1:34:30| Now, I'm sure the developers that are listening in are going to scream, but Mark, I guarantee the TIFF, and that's absolutely true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5670)|
| 1:34:37| But technically, it is a grant from the entity to KCDC typically to the private developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5677)|
| 1:34:46| That grant used to be – there used to be some ways to get around the taxation of that grant as income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5686)|
| 1:34:51| Those loopholes were largely closed in 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5691)|
| 1:34:57| If TIFFs are used to pay for public infrastructure, which is not owned by the developer, that's not usually a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5697)|
| 1:35:04| It doesn't really result in taxable income, but a typical downtown redevelopment project where people acquire an older building and convert it to condos, our typical way of subsidizing that building would be to essentially do a TIFF to provide a grant to underwrite the part or all the purchase price of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5704)|
| 1:35:25| Those funds could now be – would likely be taxable to the developer and would therefore make it less attractive to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5725)|
| 1:35:32| So you're seeing more and more developers, particularly for apartment projects, gravitate toward pilots where they can get tax abatement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5732)|
| 1:35:40| And some of you may be saying, wait a minute here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5740)|
| 1:35:43| Tax abatement, you just said, is the flip side of the TIFF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5743)|
| 1:35:46| It's essentially the same economic incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5746)|
| 1:35:48| It's the use of property taxes, and that's absolutely true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5748)|
| 1:35:52| But for some reason, Congress, in its wisdom or lack thereof, decided that the – that they wouldn't tax the value of abatement, but they would tax the value of a TIFF grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5752)|
| 1:36:04| And so we are not seeing a ton of TIFFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5764)|
| 1:36:08| I know my friend Joe Petrie is looking in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5768)|
| 1:36:11| He probably did the last large TIFF on Regas Square, and which – and certain TIFFs would be grandfathered if we already have a redevelopment plan in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5771)|
| 1:36:21| But so you still may see some, and still it may make economic sense, but we are seeing fewer TIFFs and a lot more requests for tax abatement through pilots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5781)|
| 1:36:30| So what entities can do pilots and TIFFs in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5790)|
| 1:36:36| Well, industrial development boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5796)|
| 1:36:38| Industrial development boards are public nonprofit corporations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5798)|
| 1:36:41| One's been created by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5801)|
| 1:36:43| One's been created by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5803)|
| 1:36:45| Obviously, the city appoints the members of the city board, and the county appoints the members of the county board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5805)|
| 1:36:50| They are separate legal entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5810)|
| 1:36:52| There is no legal relationship between the two, other than that Todd Napier and the development corporation that Todd is the CEO of provide management services to both boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5812)|
| 1:37:05| The county also has a board called a health ed board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5825)|
| 1:37:08| The city does not have a health ed board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5828)|
| 1:37:10| Health ed boards largely provide health assistance for low-income housing projects and certain 501c3 projects for 501c3 hospitals and schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5830)|
| 1:37:22| You might ask why the city does not have a health ed board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5842)|
| 1:37:24| It's really not been necessary because the county health ed board has been able to provide bond financings for 501c3s when needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5844)|
| 1:37:33| And also, KCDC, under a state statute that we've worked on, can step in and provide the pilots for low-income housing that a health ed board otherwise would be required to do in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5853)|
| 1:37:47| So you see KCDC doing most of the tax abatements for low-income housing projects that are within the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5867)|
| 1:37:55| So that's because, again, that they can step in and act for the health ed board as to housing projects, given that their mission is housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5875)|
| 1:38:03| Again, if I were on your, if I was a city council member, as obviously you guys are, I would be saying this is a bunch of legal jargon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5883)|
| 1:38:15| Why don't we make this simple?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5895)|
| 1:38:17| Why don't we just take care of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5897)|
| 1:38:19| Why don't we just come to city council and we get to decide how much taxes get to be abated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5899)|
| 1:38:24| Why don't we just take care of it and they can just mark it on the tax records?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5904)|
| 1:38:28| And I often joke about this being a lawyer's relief act because the Constitution prohibits you from not taxing everybody equally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5908)|
| 1:38:39| When you set the tax rate, everyone has to be taxed equally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5919)|
| 1:38:42| There are exemptions from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5922)|
| 1:38:45| There are exemptions for certain charitable entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5925)|
| 1:38:48| But the big exemption is for governmental entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5928)|
| 1:38:51| And so the end run around our Constitution for many, many years has been to use entities like industrial boards, health ed boards and KCDC to take ownership title to assets that are otherwise going to be used for private purposes like low-income housing, like manufacturing, like downtown apartments and downtown redevelopment projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5931)|
| 1:39:17| And they turn around and they lease them to a private entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5957)|
| 1:39:21| But because title to the property, if you go to the register of deeds, is held by the industrial development board or the health ed board or KCDC, title, because it's owned by a governmental entity, it is exempt from taxation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5961)|
| 1:39:37| And so the person then agrees to make some type of payment in lieu of tax under the lease back to the person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5977)|
| 1:39:47| It's been typical practice in Knoxville that we at least charge them the taxes, a pilot payment equal to the taxes that were attributable to that property before the property was redeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=5987)|
| 1:40:00| So there's usually some sort of base pilot payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6000)|
| 1:40:03| But I've always somewhat joked that a pilot is really a euphemism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6003)|
| 1:40:07| I mean, it's a payment in lieu of tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6007)|
| 1:40:09| But in many jurisdictions, the payment sometimes is zero or $1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6009)|
| 1:40:14| Here in Knoxville and Knox County, we typically have at least, again, gotten the base taxes similar as if you would with tax increment financing where you don't take a step backwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6014)|
| 1:40:23| Is that always true? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6023)|
| 1:40:25| There are instances where the property was owned by a governmental entity before it went under a pilot or a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6025)|
| 1:40:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6033)|
| 1:40:34| For example, the Candy Factory, which was a pilot, excuse me, a TIF done many years ago, was owned by the city of Knoxville before they sought proposals to redevelop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6034)|
| 1:40:43| And so the TIF there, the base taxes were zero because when the TIF was approved, it was owned by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6043)|
| 1:40:50| So there were no base taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6050)|
| 1:40:52| So that's an example of how that would have arisen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6052)|
| 1:40:56| That could also be true, for example, for a number of the school sites, old schools that have been redeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6056)|
| 1:41:01| They were owned by the county schools, sometimes by the city, and so they were not taxable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6061)|
| 1:41:07| Some of those even there, they do have some base payment, but often there is very, very limited base payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6067)|
| 1:41:12| And so unfortunately, because it would be much more pragmatic and simpler, you all just don't have the statutory authority or because of our state constitution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6072)|
| 1:41:24| we have to go through this rigmarole of running these things through IDBs and through KCDC, and it creates legal work for people like me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6084)|
| 1:41:37| And it's not the most efficient way to do things, but we'd have to amend the constitution to get around doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6097)|
| 1:41:47| So what is your role then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6107)|
| 1:41:50| If you can't directly do these pilots, what is your role?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6110)|
| 1:41:56| So the state law says that you must delegate to the IDB or the health ed board or KCDC who acts as the health board, the authority to negotiate a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6116)|
| 1:42:14| So you've seen these resolutions that we brought to you all, these delegation resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6134)|
| 1:42:20| The most recent one was for that student housing project on Cumberland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6140)|
| 1:42:23| That's what you adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6143)|
| 1:42:25| You adopted a resolution delegating the authority to negotiate a payment in lieu of tax agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6145)|
| 1:42:32| It's a sort of funny history, actually, because when Saturn came to Spring Hill, their local industrial board, they not only negotiated a pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6152)|
| 1:42:41| they decided they would just keep it in the industrial development board for basically chamber of commerce, industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6161)|
| 1:42:48| just basically as a slush fund to support their local economic development and not turn it over to the city or the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6168)|
| 1:42:54| You might guess that the legislators didn't like that too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6174)|
| 1:42:58| So basically the law has evolved that it's clear that all these entities I've been talking about cannot delegate the authority to you all to excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6178)|
| 1:43:09| cannot undertake a pilot unless you give them the authority to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6189)|
| 1:43:13| So at the county level, the county has a blanket delegation to its IDB to do pilots for basically the kind of things that Doug and his team are recruiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6193)|
| 1:43:27| In other words, it used to be people would call it smokestack chasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6207)|
| 1:43:33| I mean, very few smokestacks these days, as you guys well know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6213)|
| 1:43:37| But traditional industrial recruitment, Doug and Todd and their team, they have a blanket delegation resolution that if somebody wants to locate in an industrial park that's outside the city limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6217)|
| 1:43:52| they know how long of a pilot they can grant them based on job creation, capital investment, and other factors without going back to county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6232)|
| 1:44:00| If it's within the city limits, like the Fraley and Schilling one, they have to come to you all for a delegation resolution if they choose to come through the city industrial development board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6240)|
| 1:44:12| Save that thought to the last bullet point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6252)|
| 1:44:15| I'm going to come back to that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6255)|
| 1:44:18| So there is one big exception for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6258)|
| 1:44:21| Pilots for low-income housing tax credit projects do not have to come to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6261)|
| 1:44:26| There was a general consensus that low-income housing tax credit projects, that affordable housing is a good thing, that we want to encourage it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6266)|
| 1:44:34| We don't want it to be caught up in political football, and that's not a candidly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6274)|
| 1:44:41| This was not an issue so much with the big four cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6281)|
| 1:44:45| This was an issue more with smaller communities where often people would say, I don't want that Section 8 project next to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6285)|
| 1:44:51| And often a mayor would be very supportive of it, but the council or a county commission didn't want to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6291)|
| 1:44:59| And so they basically said, if you could take this burden away from me from having to vote in favor of supporting a Section 8 project, I'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6299)|
| 1:45:07| So the legislature adopted a law that basically says the mayor can basically write a letter for what we call a LIHTC project and say, I support this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6307)|
| 1:45:16| I would request you to grant a pilot, and if you would please, I would recommend this term and this payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6316)|
| 1:45:23| And so that's why you don't see many, you don't see delegation resolutions on LIHTC projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6323)|
| 1:45:31| And so that's why you don't see many, you don't see delegation resolutions on LIHTC projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6331)|
| 1:45:36| Because the mayor can provide a support letter without having to bring that to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6336)|
| 1:45:42| Now, here is probably the most controversial thing I'm going to tell you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6342)|
| 1:45:46| So if you're otherwise tuned out, this is probably the moment you might want to tune in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6346)|
| 1:45:54| So, you know, there's that bad risk of forum shopping that people can go between boards and try to cut better deals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6354)|
| 1:46:12| I'm very proud of our community that they've worked well together over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6372)|
| 1:46:16| And Stephanie is a great ambassador for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6376)|
| 1:46:19| She speaks frequently with Chris Caldwell and now Dwight Vandeveid about issues relative to economic incentives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6379)|
| 1:46:29| And I know that our city and county will continue to work well together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6389)|
| 1:46:33| Historically, that's not always been true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6393)|
| 1:46:36| I know that many of you will be shocked that Victor Ashe and Dwight Kessel for a while didn't get along so well, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6396)|
| 1:46:44| And at one point you could do TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6404)|
| 1:46:47| The city could do tax increment financing without county approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6407)|
| 1:46:51| And the county was none too happy with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6411)|
| 1:46:55| And they got the law changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6415)|
| 1:46:57| As you might also guess, counties for years have tried to get this law changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6417)|
| 1:47:01| But they have not succeeded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6421)|
| 1:47:04| The only success they've had was about two, three years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6424)|
| 1:47:10| If you want to do a retail pilot, a pilot that supports a retail project, and many of our projects in the city limits have a retail component downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6430)|
| 1:47:21| If the pilot provides abatement of county taxes of over ten years, then we have to go to county commission to get their blessing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6441)|
| 1:47:29| So a lot of downtown, like, I mean, a good example, for example, the Farragut Hotel, that one actually got caught up in the middle of that legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6449)|
| 1:47:38| And they had to go and get county approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6458)|
| 1:47:41| Even though it says retail, and many people will not consider a hotel to be retail, the author of that bill considers hotels to be retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6461)|
| 1:47:49| And so my advice has been to get county approval for hotels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6469)|
| 1:47:53| But anything that has a retail component of over ten years, you would need to go to the county to get approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6473)|
| 1:48:02| And, again, this is a reciprocal thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6482)|
| 1:48:04| Again, you can do, you theoretically can do the same thing to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6484)|
| 1:48:08| It's not healthy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6488)|
| 1:48:10| A number of counties have created joint boards to try to collaborate on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6490)|
| 1:48:16| It's not necessary, but it is important to realize that if you all decided, hey, we're not going to do any more pilots in downtown Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6496)|
| 1:48:25| and the county wanted to do them still and thought it was bad policy that the county has every legal right to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6505)|
| 1:48:31| And believe it or not, that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6511)|
| 1:48:36| I mean, I've seen a lot of that in jurisdictions across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6516)|
| 1:48:40| So that's your role in a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6520)|
| 1:48:42| What's your role in a TIF?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6522)|
| 1:48:44| Your role in a TIF is to approve a redevelopment plan if it's a KCDC TIF or an economic impact plan if the TIF ran through the Industrial Development Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6524)|
| 1:48:54| Or we bring a lot of amendments to you all for downtown redevelopment plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6534)|
| 1:48:58| Knoxville, unlike Nashville, Nashville, and I often tease Ben Bentley, our executive director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6538)|
| 1:49:06| because he came from MDHA, which is Nashville's version of KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6546)|
| 1:49:12| I like KCDC better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6552)|
| 1:49:13| It's got better alliteration to it than MDHA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6553)|
| 1:49:16| But these huge tax increment districts, they would get the entire increment off the districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6556)|
| 1:49:23| And candidly, they just held it back, and they built up what the comptroller characterized as slush funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6563)|
| 1:49:29| I think somewhat unfairly, but that's what he characterized them as,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6569)|
| 1:49:33| where they built up huge reserves of tax increment dollars from these large, large areas that covered much of downtown Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6573)|
| 1:49:43| We have one very large TIF area in the South Waterfront area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6583)|
| 1:49:50| I can assure you there's no slush fund there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6590)|
| 1:49:53| But it's not, in my judgment, was not very well conceived because I think it was really somewhat overly ambitious in terms of what a general TIF district can do without focus, without a lot of focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6593)|
| 1:50:09| And so the, I'm sorry, I'm just checking my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6609)|
| 1:50:14| I'm sorry, I know I'm pushing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6614)|
| 1:50:16| I'm totally a little bit of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6616)|
| 1:50:17| So the, we don't, we have traditionally not done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6617)|
| 1:50:23| We have brought every single tax increment financing deal to you guys so you can approve each deal usually as a new redevelopment plan or as to an amendment to an existing redevelopment plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6623)|
| 1:50:35| And we felt like that transparency was a better approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6635)|
| 1:50:40| I do not believe there's been an IDB TIF done in Knoxville yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6640)|
| 1:50:44| There have been three done in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6644)|
| 1:50:48| Now, let me correct myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6648)|
| 1:50:50| North Shore Town Center technically is within the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6650)|
| 1:50:53| The city's portion of that TIF has been paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6653)|
| 1:50:55| The county's portion has not been fully paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6655)|
| 1:50:57| So, and that TIF was approved through the industrial board of the county of Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6657)|
| 1:51:02| Again, I'm going to have to fly here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6662)|
| 1:51:06| I'm going to have to fly here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6666)|
| 1:51:08| I'm going to have to fly here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6668)|
| 1:51:10| I'm going to have to fly here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6670)|
| 1:51:12| I'm going to have to fly here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6672)|
| 1:51:14| I'm going to have to fly here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6674)|
| 1:51:16| I'm going to have to fly here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6676)|
| 1:51:18| I'm going to have to fly here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6678)|
| 1:51:20| I'm going to have to fly here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6680)|
| 1:51:22| I'm going to have to fly here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6682)|
| 1:51:24| I'm going to have to fly here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6684)|
| 1:51:26| I'm going to have to fly here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6686)|
| 1:51:28| So, those are the main reasons for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6688)|
| 1:51:33| And then this is the most commonly used, because it is by far the most common TIF person here in downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6693)|
| 1:51:41| And they go, they borrow against the incremental tax revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6701)|
| 1:51:43| And let me be really clear here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6703)|
| 1:51:45| They do not put KCDC's credit or the city's credit behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6705)|
| 1:51:49| The borrowing is purely based on these incremental tax revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6709)|
| 1:51:51| the proceeds of the borrowing are used to supplement the financing for the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6711)|
| 1:51:57| This is an example. This is very basic TIFF math. If you have base taxes of $10,000 on an old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6717)|
| 1:52:03| building downtown, it gets renovated. The taxes after completion are $110,000. You do get some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6723)|
| 1:52:11| additional juice, as I call it, right off the bat once the project is completed. We get our debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6731)|
| 1:52:17| service component of city taxes. If 15% of our taxes is used to pay debt service on the city's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6737)|
| 1:52:25| bonds, you get that. You cannot give that to the developer under state law. You get the base taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6745)|
| 1:52:31| you get the debt service component, but the remainder legally can be given to support the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6751)|
| 1:52:37| tax increment financing. This is probably the next most important slide. Your delegation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6757)|
| 1:52:49| authority is, how do you know if you really need to provide incentive, whether it be a TIFF or a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6769)|
| 1:52:55| pilot? You saw that exercise recently, and some of you that have been on council longer have seen a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6775)|
| 1:53:01| number of these projects come through. We've hired a third-party consultant to try to kick the tires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6781)|
| 1:53:06| as hard as we can without spending a gazillion dollars trying to kick them to determine, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6786)|
| 1:53:13| your goal, I believe, is to, I mean, I'm not saying your individual goal, but historically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6793)|
| 1:53:19| the city's goal has been to give a sufficient incentive to encourage redevelopment, primarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6799)|
| 1:53:26| in the downtown and ancillary areas that need redevelopment, largely up and down the Broadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6806)|
| 1:53:32| Central Avenue corridor and moving down the Magnolia corridor, and then somewhat in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6812)|
| 1:53:37| Mechanicsville area to make these projects work. So how do you know how much you need to do? It is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6817)|
| 1:53:44| not science, unfortunately. There's a lot of art to it. Again, Stephanie has shown a real alacrity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6824)|
| 1:53:50| to learning this stuff and is picking it up very quickly, and it's been fun to see her do that. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6830)|
| 1:53:57| think she will be a good, really a good tire kicker for the city as we go through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6837)|
| 1:54:05| To be frank, a company like Fraley and Schilling, you don't kick the, we don't do a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6845)|
| 1:54:12| but-for analysis there. The but-for is for industrial projects generally is, if we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6852)|
| 1:54:18| offer them incentive, they're going to go to Alabama or Mississippi or Georgia or Kentucky,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6858)|
| 1:54:23| who are throwing large incentives at them. Many other jurisdictions have much more lucrative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6863)|
| 1:54:28| incentives than we offer, not just Knoxville, Knox County, but Tennessee generally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6868)|
| 1:54:33| And generally, if you have an income tax in your state, there are usually very lucrative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6873)|
| 1:54:37| income tax credits offered to businesses like Fraley and Schilling. But even more true for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6877)|
| 1:54:43| manufacturers, it's hard for us to compete with incentives, but if we don't play the game,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6883)|
| 1:54:50| you will lose a lot of projects. I can't tell you, you know, that's, again, that's an art.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6890)|
| 1:54:55| You know, sometimes people don't care. They just, we're the right spot for them, but trying to divine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6895)|
| 1:55:01| what incentive is needed to get a win, the industry is often very difficult to do. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6901)|
| 1:55:08| the analysis for in recruiting business from out of state is very different from the organic growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6908)|
| 1:55:15| that we focused on in redevelopment in downtown. There, we try to not offer an incentive greater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6915)|
| 1:55:23| than what is needed for the project to financially make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6923)|
| 1:55:32| And how does our incentive programs compare? Are we cutting edge? And I would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6932)|
| 1:55:36| we're really the only jurisdiction in the entire state that is actively doing a meaningful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6936)|
| 1:55:41| but-for analysis for our downtown, for our redevelopment projects. I know other cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6941)|
| 1:55:49| emulate us. You know, Chattanooga, this is, you know, pilots have been extraordinarily controversial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6949)|
| 1:55:55| in Chattanooga. They've largely been used for high-end housing, apartments, and there's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6955)|
| 1:56:01| an entire movement down there to try to do this. Basically, half of downtown Memphis is under a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6961)|
| 1:56:06| pilot. They basically, through their Center City Revenue Finance Corporation, which is essentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6966)|
| 1:56:11| their downtown industrial on-board, they have used pilots extensively to try to rejuvenate their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6971)|
| 1:56:17| downtown with some success. But, you know, Nashville has not had to use pilots as much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6977)|
| 1:56:25| They've used them on a few very large projects to attract major businesses, but because of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6985)|
| 1:56:30| vibrancy of the economy there, you know, they've not had to after, you know, they did some initial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6990)|
| 1:56:37| tips and pilots for things like the Batman Building and things like that. They've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=6997)|
| 1:56:41| not had to rely on tips and pilots as much as other jurisdictions to try to make projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7001)|
| 1:56:48| economically viable. They're just higher rents people will pay in downtown and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7008)|
| 1:56:53| So that's my last slide. I obviously flew through that. I teach a six-hour class called Deep Dives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7013)|
| 1:57:01| on Tips and Pilots. I would invite any of you all to come to. UT does that usually once a year, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7021)|
| 1:57:06| if you want to be tortured for six hours and learn how these are done, we're delighted to have you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7026)|
| 1:57:11| I've also done a number of tours of downtown Knoxville and explained how, you know, incentives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7031)|
| 1:57:17| were used, including new market tax credits and storage tax credits on most of the buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7037)|
| 1:57:22| in downtown Knoxville that have been renovated along with pilots. So if any of you all would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7042)|
| 1:57:27| like a downtown incentive tour, I would be delighted to do that. So how do you want to go from here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7047)|
| 1:57:37| So Mark, thank you so much, and if you can hang out for just a minute, I'm going to guess that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7057)|
| 1:57:43| there'll be some questions as well. I was hoping we've got a couple folks on the call who can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7063)|
| 1:57:48| provide some really quick examples. I think, you know, Mark, you do such a good job of going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7068)|
| 1:57:54| through the nuts and bolts, and you peppered in some great examples along the way, but I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7074)|
| 1:58:00| going to turn to Doug Lawyer. As I mentioned, the Chamber is our primary economic prosperity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7080)|
| 1:58:06| partner, and Doug, I would say, knows that these are tools that we sometimes need to use to attract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7086)|
| 1:58:15| or retain business, and so, Doug, would you mind providing us with an example from your work that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7095)|
| 1:58:21| really reflects kind of what we're trying to achieve with these tax incentives? Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7101)|
| 1:58:27| Thank you, Stephanie, and I went back and tried to find a project that I thought really spoke to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7107)|
| 1:58:34| job creation impact of doing a pilot in the city. Back in 2003, everybody loves Bush's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7114)|
| 1:58:42| baked beans, right, and you know their corporate headquarters is here in Knoxville and production| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7122)|
| 1:58:47| facilities in Jefferson County, but back in 2003, they were looking at doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7127)|
| 1:58:55| locating a research and development center for baked beans, and we actually, this pilot actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7135)|
| 1:59:00| went through the county's IDB, but to Mark's point, you know, if the county IDB approves it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7140)|
| 1:59:06| it freezes the city taxes, and ultimately, they ended up doing a three-year pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7146)|
| 1:59:13| but that pilot helped us get an expansion of 44,000 square foot research and development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7153)|
| 1:59:20| center. It's about a 15 million dollar project, and they created 38 food science| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7160)|
| 1:59:29| research and development jobs with an average wage of $74,000 a year, and that was back in 2003,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7169)|
| 1:59:35| and so that R&D center that is still here in Knoxville, still going, you know, you put a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7175)|
| 1:59:42| little incentive on the front end of a deal, and you get long-term results, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7182)|
| 1:59:48| that's my example on everyone's favorite baked beans. So, good example of, you know, we use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7188)|
| 1:59:55| these tools in different ways. This is an economic development sort of jobs R&D incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7195)|
| 2:00:03| Becky Wade is on the line, and I think she's got a good example of a LIHTC or affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7203)|
| 2:00:12| pilot. So, hello, Becky. Hi, everybody. I've been here the whole time. Very interesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7212)|
| 2:00:20| and thank you, Mark, for your thorough, as always, overview of tips and pilots. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7220)|
| 2:00:28| example I want to give is one about renovation and rehab. I know many of you know about the ARDF| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7228)|
| 2:00:36| and the new units that we build and we're building, but we also use pilots for LIHTC housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7236)|
| 2:00:44| that purchases older apartments that are affordable and rehabilitates those and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7244)|
| 2:00:53| restarts the life on the affordability period. So, one that we entered in with KCDC recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7253)|
| 2:00:59| is Covenant Village. LHP is doing this project. This is 71 apartments that were built in 1983| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7259)|
| 2:01:07| in Fountain City on Forestall Drive. Used to be called Forest Creek, and so this area is what HUD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7267)|
| 2:01:14| would consider an area of opportunity. Good schools, a lot of jobs, close to many amenities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7274)|
| 2:01:22| for the folks that live in those apartments. And so, LHP is investing $13.6 million into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7282)|
| 2:01:29| this development to provide totally modernized, energy-efficient, affordable housing and extend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7289)|
| 2:01:36| the affordability period for 30 years for households at 60 percent of the area median| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7296)|
| 2:01:43| income or below. And this development also has a HUD project-based subsidy, which will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7303)|
| 2:01:49| extended for 30 years also. So, we're participating with this development through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7309)|
| 2:01:57| our home funds. They've applied for rental rehab through our office, and so we're providing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7317)|
| 2:02:03| $500,000 in federal home funds to assist it. But in order to make this project happen, the pilot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7323)|
| 2:02:13| has to be in place. Without it, it's anticipated that the property taxes would go up by around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7333)|
| 2:02:21| $100,000 annually, which would prevent the project from having a cash flow to cover the debt and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7341)|
| 2:02:28| operating costs, which is the purpose of the pilots for the affordable housing deals. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7348)|
| 2:02:34| that's a great example of how we're using a pilot in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7354)|
| 2:02:39| Great. Thanks, Becky. And that, those pilots are, the lease is held by KCDC, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7359)|
| 2:02:48| That's correct. So, we're glad to have, I mean, again, multiple partners who are involved with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7368)|
| 2:02:54| this, and Ben Bentley at KCDC is also on the line. I know we're about, I mean, we're over on time at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7374)|
| 2:03:02| this point. I do just want to mention one more example, because I think it's important in near| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7382)|
| 2:03:08| and dear to many of us on the line. A few years ago, we entered into a pilot agreement on the Cal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7388)|
| 2:03:17| Johnson building, and I think many of you on the line remember that was an endangered historic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7397)|
| 2:03:23| building. It was one of the last remaining buildings that was owned and built by Cal Johnson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7403)|
| 2:03:30| who was a former slave, and that building has been successfully renovated, is occupied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7410)|
| 2:03:39| has fully occupied with apartments, and there's retail space that I think, once COVID is behind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7419)|
| 2:03:48| us, will be very rentable and a great asset to our downtown. So, some really good examples of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7428)|
| 2:03:55| how these incentives have helped really revitalize our city to draw jobs and business and investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7435)|
| 2:04:05| and what we see over the long term is that this really does bring more revenue into our city that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7445)|
| 2:04:14| will allow us to, it provides furniture, first of all. I think, as Mike Odom indicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7454)|
| 2:04:20| sometimes you need that cool stuff and that investment for your city to thrive, but then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7460)|
| 2:04:27| in the long term, we also actually do end up with increased revenue, whether it's through the sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7467)|
| 2:04:32| tax from a retail operation, from new jobs that are coming into our community, or ultimately, as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7472)|
| 2:04:39| these projects roll back onto the tax roll, it's increased tax revenue. So, I'm going to stop there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7479)|
| 2:04:48| and Vice Mayor, I'm turning it over to you. I know we're over on time, and I appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7488)|
| 2:04:53| everyone hanging in there. Okay, thanks. Thank you, everyone, for the presentation. Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7493)|
| 2:04:59| I just want to ask, is everyone okay with us continuing the conversation, maybe for another 30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7499)|
| 2:05:05| to 45 minutes, or do people have obligations you need to drop from the call? Do we have anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7505)|
| 2:05:15| I can give you a half hour. Okay. All right. Any objections? Okay. If not, team, let's continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7515)|
| 2:05:23| to the conversation. So, I know that you guys were rushing through. I'm sorry, you have a question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7523)|
| 2:05:31| Council Member Fugate? Just when you get to it. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So, we're going to go ahead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7531)|
| 2:05:37| and let me open it back up for questions, further dialogue. All right, Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7537)|
| 2:05:47| Thank you. So, Stephanie or Mark, I don't know who this, probably Stephanie, Deputy Mayor Welch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7547)|
| 2:05:55| this is probably more likely a question for you. I'm very familiar with the housing piece. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7555)|
| 2:06:03| I think, as Mark said, that was probably one of the first things that we used it for way back in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7563)|
| 2:06:08| the day when it started. How big a tool do you think it will be in the jobs piece? We haven't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7568)|
| 2:06:17| used these very much. And so, I think, as a community, we think of them as a housing tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7577)|
| 2:06:24| How do you see them playing out more as an economic development job creation tool?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7584)|
| 2:06:32| And how do we also broaden people's perspective that that's what it is? Because I think every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7592)|
| 2:06:40| time people hear TIF and PILOT, they think downtown condos or affordable housing. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7600)|
| 2:06:47| that's kind of a leading question, but I'm curious. No, thanks so much, Councilman Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7607)|
| 2:06:54| And I think you've hit the nail on the head. I mean, my understanding, again, being relatively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7614)|
| 2:06:59| new to this role is that the city has not extensively used tax incentives for job creation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7619)|
| 2:07:09| or job retention recruitment. Mr. Lawyer can chime in here as well, but as we went through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7629)|
| 2:07:18| the process with Fraley Schilling, I think it really helped us. And Todd Napiers jumped on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7638)|
| 2:07:23| because he was so helpful as we crafted our council resolution to ensure not only that we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7643)|
| 2:07:32| creating a tool that would be useful for retention and expansion of jobs, but that also we had some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7652)|
| 2:07:38| accountability measures in there and that job creation expectation could be measured,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7658)|
| 2:07:45| and there was a clawback if the goals were not met. So, I definitely see it as a tool that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7665)|
| 2:07:52| can use more frequently and more strategically. And then Mr. Napier or Mr. Lawyer might have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7672)|
| 2:08:01| some additional comments about this. We can't hear you, Todd, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7681)|
| 2:08:09| All right. Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7689)|
| 2:08:16| There we go. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7696)|
| 2:08:17| All right. Well, I tried to put the headphones on to block out the excess noise around me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7697)|
| 2:08:22| but we'll suffer through it together. I looked through the list. There's actually been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7702)|
| 2:08:30| about nine pilots that we've engaged in over the course of the last 17 years or so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7710)|
| 2:08:38| I would say that had some job aspects to it. Actually, Knoxville Locomotive Works was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7718)|
| 2:08:46| project that we worked on that got a pilot, was redevelopment, and that was one. Team Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7726)|
| 2:08:55| Headquarters Expansion not too long ago would have been another one out there at Brooklawn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7735)|
| 2:09:02| not Brooklawn, but there at Paper Mill. So, there's been several, and I think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7742)|
| 2:09:09| absolutely going to be necessary in certain cases to use this tool, and it's great to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7749)|
| 2:09:14| have it. And Stephanie's been fantastic. Dialogue I've had with her and really trying to be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7754)|
| 2:09:22| little more systematic, I think, is our goal about that going forward and trying to come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7762)|
| 2:09:27| with some things. But, you know, I think we've reaped some success as a city from the pilot tool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7767)|
| 2:09:37| on the jobs front, as well as the redevelopment. Does that answer your question, Councilwoman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7777)|
| 2:09:42| Pena? Yes, I think people just hear more about it with housing because we've done more of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7782)|
| 2:09:50| and the Deputy Mayor, what you talked about about the accountability clause and some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7790)|
| 2:09:57| the job creation things may be something we haven't seen much of before. I think it's always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7797)|
| 2:10:03| been there. I think that as Todd said, I think we've just been put it in a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7803)|
| 2:10:09| structured framework and made it really clear on the front end, both the Council, the City IDB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7809)|
| 2:10:17| and also for the ultimate employer. So, yeah. Good thing. I didn't vote on any of those. Maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7817)|
| 2:10:24| that's why I don't remember. Councilman Smith? Thank you. Appreciate the rapid pace, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7824)|
| 2:10:39| Thanks for breezing through that for us. I think, Stephanie, you mentioned earlier about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7839)|
| 2:10:45| two primary benefits for pilots related to mostly affordable housing related or just in general are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7845)|
| 2:10:57| increased property tax revenue. And I don't know that you mentioned this, but we know it to be true| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7857)|
| 2:11:03| that there's no out-of-pocket expense for the city or taxpayer for pilots. So, those are two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7863)|
| 2:11:11| benefits. But one of the things that I think is important for folks maybe watching at home or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7871)|
| 2:11:17| just generally for all of us to be reminded by is that adding to our housing inventory or capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7877)|
| 2:11:27| indirectly offers some affordable housing to the city for residents. So, even if I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7887)|
| 2:11:34| think we want to go the Chattanooga route where we're constantly offering pilots for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7894)|
| 2:11:39| high-end condos that are really expensive, but for those tricky situations where we do offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7899)|
| 2:11:46| pilots for apartments or whatnot, even if those directly are not affordable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7906)|
| 2:11:52| it will create inventory for affordable housing at the lower end of that kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7912)|
| 2:12:01| continuum of housing. So, that's one I'm just always reminded of. I did have a question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7921)|
| 2:12:06| and maybe it's a combo maybe for you, Stephanie, and for Mark. And it's somewhat related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7926)|
| 2:12:13| Redevelopment areas, we're talking about TIFs and pilots, but designated redevelopment areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7933)|
| 2:12:19| give the city some extra tools for development. Can you refresh us what those extra tools are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7939)|
| 2:12:26| You know what I'm going to do, and I think that both your comment and the question that you just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7946)|
| 2:12:31| asked would be a great reason to pull Ben Bentley into our conversation from KCBC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7951)|
| 2:12:41| So, Mr. Bentley, would you mind? We'd love to hear your voice tonight if you wouldn't mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7961)|
| 2:12:48| chiming in. Absolutely. Yeah, it's an honor. Redevelopment partner. Yes, sir. Cool, cool. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7968)|
| 2:12:55| good evening, everyone. On the first point Tommy made, Councilman Smith, that's absolutely accurate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7975)|
| 2:13:01| relative to housing supply. So, within the last year, I think it was January of 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7981)|
| 2:13:06| Brookings came out with a study that really focused on there being two ways to affect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7986)|
| 2:13:12| affordability in a metro area. Number one is increased subsidized units in that area. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7992)|
| 2:13:17| that's kind of intuitive. But the other piece is through zoning and through underutilized land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=7997)|
| 2:13:22| build more housing. So, I don't think it's an either or there. I think both are effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8002)|
| 2:13:28| approaches and we need to be doing both. And through the Affordable Rental Development Fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8008)|
| 2:13:33| we're subsidizing additional low-income housing. And I know through the use of pilots and TIFs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8013)|
| 2:13:38| historically, we have incentivized density, which I think is the best way to really build out that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8018)|
| 2:13:43| housing supply that is going to impact a local area, but it's also going to impact the entire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8023)|
| 2:13:48| housing supply in the Knoxville market. Does that make sense? Yeah, thank you. And then on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8028)|
| 2:13:55| the redevelopment question, what tools do we have in our toolbox with that designation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8035)|
| 2:14:02| So, in a redevelopment area, and Mark, chime in at any point, because Mark actually has the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8042)|
| 2:14:07| bulleted list of powers in a redevelopment area memorized, whereas I just have to kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8047)|
| 2:14:12| summarize them. But it's generally tax increment finance. There's some tools related to acquisition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8052)|
| 2:14:19| There's utilities that we can do. So, it's sort of a way to, I guess, a way to think about it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8059)|
| 2:14:27| an area that has underutilized land or maybe vacant buildings. There are lots of different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8067)|
| 2:14:33| mechanisms we can bring to bear, but the main financial resource in that is tax increment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8073)|
| 2:14:38| finance in that area. And as Mark mentioned earlier, that can do public utilities, public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8078)|
| 2:14:44| infrastructure, or it can also support certain aspects of private development if those are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8084)|
| 2:14:49| desirable from a community standpoint. Hey, Ben, thanks for chiming in on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8089)|
| 2:14:54| because one of the things that I just want to make sure council understands is the important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8094)|
| 2:14:58| role that KCDC plays. Oftentimes, we think of KCDC as being our housing partner, but they are also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8098)|
| 2:15:07| the city's redevelopment partner. And so, KCDC has taken the lead on some really key| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8107)|
| 2:15:13| redevelopment projects for us right now, and we really appreciate Ben's leadership. I think Mark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8113)|
| 2:15:20| took his mute off to memorize the list that he has. Well, no, that would waste your time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8120)|
| 2:15:28| but I do think a couple concepts are important. One is when we do a redevelopment plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8128)|
| 2:15:33| we don't normally put the tax increment financing provision in the plan. What we say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8133)|
| 2:15:39| let's say we create a redevelopment plan for the Jackson Avenue area, which we have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8139)|
| 2:15:44| What it then says is, if we want to do a TIF for a specific project, we will amend that plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8144)|
| 2:15:50| bring it back to you all to approve the tax increment financing. So, we have lots of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8150)|
| 2:15:56| redevelopment plans out there that do not have a tax increment component to them. And so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8156)|
| 2:16:01| unlike a lot of communities, again, and I love to tease Ben about Nashville, but we do not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8161)|
| 2:16:06| ask for your preapproval. We try to be really transparent and bring the numbers back to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8166)|
| 2:16:11| guys that you can decide whether that's a good incentive that you want to vote on and support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8171)|
| 2:16:17| The laundry list of powers in a redevelopment area go way beyond tax increment financing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8177)|
| 2:16:25| as Ben mentioned. A couple that you might find interesting, and I know urban renewal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8185)|
| 2:16:29| has terrible connotations, many people, for good reason from the 60s. But our statute is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8189)|
| 2:16:35| redevelopment and urban renewal statute, and we obviously focus on the redevelopment aspect of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8195)|
| 2:16:41| But under the urban renewal aspect of it, you actually can do facade acquisitions and grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8201)|
| 2:16:47| And so, we used that statute back in the early 2000s to basically buy the facades of the entire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8207)|
| 2:16:53| market square, everyone that would play ball with us, which was about 90% of the property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8213)|
| 2:16:59| We actually issued bonds to the city, took part of the proceeds into buy and renovate essentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8219)|
| 2:17:05| all the facades on Market Square, and then got easements to preserve them forever. And the only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8225)|
| 2:17:11| way we could do that is that we had a redevelopment and urban renewal plan, and we had the support of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8231)|
| 2:17:16| the folks that are on Market Square. That's just one really helpful example. And as I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8236)|
| 2:17:20| I had tons of fun looking through all my old computer documents. I'm going to get with Jack| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8240)|
| 2:17:25| Neely and write a history of redevelopment in downtown Knoxville now. But it was, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8245)|
| 2:17:31| a very successful project. I think the last person, we still had a couple of folks that just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8251)|
| 2:17:37| refused to collaborate, but generally, it was very successful because of the redevelopment powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8257)|
| 2:17:43| One other really not minor, also, if a property is in a redevelopment area and the city owns it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8263)|
| 2:17:50| like you did the Supreme Court site, you can sole source it to the developer you think is best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8270)|
| 2:17:56| to develop the site without having to basically put it up for public auction. So that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8276)|
| 2:18:01| you can control the redevelopment of a site that's city-owned for some reason within a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8281)|
| 2:18:06| redevelopment area. There's a special exception in the city ordinances that allows you to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8286)|
| 2:18:14| And so that's, again, there is a long list of powers in a redevelopment area, but those are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8294)|
| 2:18:19| some ones that might interest you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8299)|
| 2:18:26| Councilman Testerman? Yeah, so this may have been how, I think I've asked this question before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8306)|
| 2:18:33| but how many TIFs and pilots currently exist do we have? And then my second question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8313)|
| 2:18:40| how does Knoxville, how do we track compliance and accountability of these, whether it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8320)|
| 2:18:48| infrastructure improvements or back to Councilman Fugates, you know, for job commitments, et cetera?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8328)|
| 2:18:59| Well, go ahead, Mark. Go ahead. No, I'm sorry. That was very rude, Stephanie. I didn't mean to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8339)|
| 2:19:03| do that. My mic was on and I was free thinking. The TIF, you're right. Just give me a straight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8343)|
| 2:19:12| answer to my question. It's a little bit tricky because first you have KCDC TIFs. When I last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8352)|
| 2:19:18| look at the list, there's a little bit over 30 that we have outstanding through KCDC. Then you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8358)|
| 2:19:23| have pilots done through the City Industrial Development Board. The last list I saw from Todd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8363)|
| 2:19:29| and he can correct me, was around 45 or so of those. There may be more now, but some of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8369)|
| 2:19:34| are burning off. Some of our TIFs are burning off fairly quickly. I'm excited about, like as I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8374)|
| 2:19:38| mentioned, Fire Street Lofts is about to burn off. So as I mentioned, North Starrer Town Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8378)|
| 2:19:44| burned off for the City this past year when the last payment increment that the City was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8384)|
| 2:19:49| responsible for was paid. So it's always a little bit of a moving target, Councilman, Member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8389)|
| 2:19:55| Tesfran, because you don't know, you know, you're always having to check to see whether they've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8395)|
| 2:19:59| paid off or not. And so, and then there's the big, then you have Knox County Industrial Development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8399)|
| 2:20:05| Board, who's done a number of TIFs, like Bush Beans. Some of them are within the City. And so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8405)|
| 2:20:11| yes, they affect City taxes, but they weren't implemented by the City. I don't know, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8411)|
| 2:20:17| I'm going to maybe Todd can comment if he happens to know how many those are. So we could definitely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8417)|
| 2:20:21| get you a precise number. There's actually, on the Comptroller's website, there's a list of all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8421)|
| 2:20:27| the active pilots and TIFs in each jurisdiction. I'm looking at it right now. It's not fully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8427)|
| 2:20:32| complete, and it's not really anybody's fault. It's just some of the older ones don't have to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8432)|
| 2:20:36| reported. And so that, but that is a good idea to give you guys sort of a number and how we compare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8436)|
| 2:20:41| to other jurisdictions. I do think other jurisdictions are somewhat cheating, because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8441)|
| 2:20:45| think our list is a lot more complete than some of the ones I'm familiar with. But the clawback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8445)|
| 2:20:52| stuff, that's in the jobs area, that's largely in Todd's domain. So I'm going to turn it off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8452)|
| 2:20:59| over to him. On the LIHTC domain, low-income housing, we only do deals that have low-income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8459)|
| 2:21:04| housing tax credits generally on the Section 8 side, and they have restrictive covenants. They| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8464)|
| 2:21:09| would lose their low-income housing tax credits if they do it. So sort of we have THDA as our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8469)|
| 2:21:14| partner, as long with KCDC administering the low-income housing tax credit aspect of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8474)|
| 2:21:20| Todd, you may want to describe briefly what you all do to, not briefly, as much as you want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8480)|
| 2:21:24| how you just, you monitor the clawbacks on jobs and capital investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8484)|
| 2:21:29| Sure. I'll step back for just a minute. So on the number of active pilots that are in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8489)|
| 2:21:38| through the City Industrial Development Board, we've got 51 active and one that's been approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8498)|
| 2:21:43| but pending closing. And then I forgot about that the county IDB probably has two active pilots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8503)|
| 2:21:52| in the city limits. And those were the old schools, like Historic Knox High, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8512)|
| 2:21:59| typically in Harbor Alley, was a former county-owned property. And then typically on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8519)|
| 2:22:08| compliance side, we handle, so what will happen is whenever the lease is approved or the pilot's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8528)|
| 2:22:17| approved, the attorney will take the resolutions and the conditions and expectations, and those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8537)|
| 2:22:23| will be put into the lease documents. And so then we'll, every year, we'll send out our pilot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8543)|
| 2:22:31| bill. So as Mark stated, I can't think of any instance when we've ever taken the taxes down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8551)|
| 2:22:39| below what they were. So the pilot payment pretty much equals whatever the taxes were prior to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8559)|
| 2:22:43| We'll collect that, and then we'll collect information. I know like a current one that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8563)|
| 2:22:49| we just recently did, you all remember Axial Logistics up on Central? There's a schedule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8569)|
| 2:22:56| and we were very intentional about, you know, getting a schedule put together that, and they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8576)|
| 2:23:03| got a five-year mark in there, which they have to hit a certain number of jobs. And depending on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8583)|
| 2:23:08| those number of jobs, whether or not there's a clawback or not. On some of the pilots, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8588)|
| 2:23:16| especially like redevelopment, if it's kind of, did they redevelop the project? Is it still being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8596)|
| 2:23:22| used for that? So they're a little bit, they're not all the same, and it really kind of depends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8602)|
| 2:23:28| on the focus. But on these ones with the jobs, it'll be a measurement of the jobs and kind of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8608)|
| 2:23:33| measurement date, at which point then we will determine whether or not they met their objectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8613)|
| 2:23:42| Thank you. And that's usually always built into the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8622)|
| 2:23:47| If I could just add in there, one of the things, I want to turn it over to Ben in just a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8627)|
| 2:23:52| because the TIFFs and the LIHTC pilots, I think you probably, Ben, could best speak to that. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8632)|
| 2:23:58| one of the things I'm really excited about Councilwoman Testerman is having Rebecca Jane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8638)|
| 2:24:03| Justice on my team, because she is, she's a very visual person and creative. So I think she has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8643)|
| 2:24:11| some really exciting ideas about how to map some of these projects so that we really get not just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8651)|
| 2:24:20| an accounting of everything, but then we can also visualize sort of where they are and the impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8660)|
| 2:24:27| that you can start to see in the surrounding community. So I just wanted to note that. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8667)|
| 2:24:34| then I don't know, Ben, if you wanted to add anything about pilots and TIFFs and how many we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8674)|
| 2:24:40| have. Yeah, sure. I can just, I luckily pulled the list earlier today, so I'm equipped to do that. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8680)|
| 2:24:46| have 20 low-income housing tax credit pilots. So those are what Becky was referring to in her case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8686)|
| 2:24:52| study example. They cover about 2,500 units in total. These are a combination of preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8692)|
| 2:25:00| So we had about 1,500 of the 2,500 were preservation, and about 1,000 were new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8700)|
| 2:25:05| construction. So that program has been extremely successful in terms of both preserving existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8705)|
| 2:25:11| affordable housing for 20- or 30-year periods, and then also building new. In terms of the TIFFs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8711)|
| 2:25:18| as Mark mentioned, we have right at 30 right now. I think there's four of those that are supposed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8718)|
| 2:25:22| be paid off as of maybe April of 21 or somewhere around in there. So some of those will start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8722)|
| 2:25:28| rolling off. As those, I mean, the amortizations are between next year, and I think the furthest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8728)|
| 2:25:34| one out is 2046. So as those roll off between the city and county, that should produce about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8734)|
| 2:25:41| $5 million in additional tax revenue, but those don't all roll off at the same time. So it's very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8741)|
| 2:25:47| much a moving target when you're trying to make those projections. Does that answer the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8747)|
| 2:25:54| No, that's terrific. Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8754)|
| 2:26:00| I'm looking for hands to see if there were any other questions. Councilwoman Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8760)|
| 2:26:06| I just was going to really quickly, there used to be a spreadsheet with a list of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8766)|
| 2:26:10| and I couldn't find it looking at the city website. So is that still there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8770)|
| 2:26:14| There is a spreadsheet. I'm going to turn to Rebecca Jane because I know, and there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8774)|
| 2:26:19| spreadsheets, there are multiple, I'm sorry to say that there are actually multiple spreadsheets. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8779)|
| 2:26:24| that's something that Rebecca Jane is really focused on, again, with her visual nature and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8784)|
| 2:26:29| figuring out how to get things all in one place and to add some other visual references. So RJ?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8789)|
| 2:26:37| Yes, Councilwoman Ryder, there is the capability to print off what we would call an attribute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8797)|
| 2:26:44| table from the story maps that currently show where all of the Pallet and TIFF projects are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8804)|
| 2:26:52| within the city and the county via the city IDB page. And one of the things we've been looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8812)|
| 2:26:59| recently is how to merge that information and make it more available and more prevalent for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8819)|
| 2:27:07| anyone to find, whether it's city staff to use that for our own tools or to collaborate with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8827)|
| 2:27:14| developers or for council people or community members to easily find that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8834)|
| 2:27:19| So how do we take that information and use it in maybe even more of a 3D fashion instead of a 2D| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8839)|
| 2:27:28| map, but that you can also pull a spreadsheet and just see a chart of the details of each Pallet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8848)|
| 2:27:35| So what type is it? How long is the term? So information like that. So I think there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8855)|
| 2:27:43| really a lot of opportunities for us to have maps and data that's more available and more effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8863)|
| 2:27:50| for us all just to be informed and to do our jobs more effectively. We can send that link out as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8870)|
| 2:27:57| well, Councilman Ryder, because I will admit that I had a little difficulty finding it as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8877)|
| 2:28:03| and it's not for any reason other than my technical ineptitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8883)|
| 2:28:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8890)|
| 2:28:13| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8893)|
| 2:28:20| I will turn it over to Vice Mayor McKenzie, but I really do want to thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8900)|
| 2:28:24| particularly Mark Mamentoff, who has been a true mentor to me in my time here in this position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8904)|
| 2:28:33| and you can tell why he really understands this tax abatement business inside and out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8913)|
| 2:28:39| and also has a keen eye for strategy. But everyone on the call, Doug and Todd and Ben,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8919)|
| 2:28:48| and then our internal city team, I think it's been a real effort, and it's an exciting piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8928)|
| 2:28:55| of work for the city. So thank you, Council, also for your support. I know that it's not always easy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8935)|
| 2:29:03| to make decisions about these particular issues, and I found this Council and previous Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8943)|
| 2:29:09| members as well have asked really insightful questions and helped us to think more strategically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8949)|
| 2:29:15| about how we're implementing these tools to really meet our goals as a city. So I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8955)|
| 2:29:21| really appreciate it. Thanks so much. Thank you so much, Deputy Chief Welch and Mark and Rebecca| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8961)|
| 2:29:32| Jane and others, Doug, for your contributions into the presentation. A lot of good information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8972)|
| 2:29:38| Council members, you should have the hard copy of the presentation that we went over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8978)|
| 2:29:42| if you do not have it, if you'll reach out to Will, he will make sure that you have that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8982)|
| 2:29:46| information. Before we go on to public forum, I do have a very important announcement to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8986)|
| 2:29:53| Today does happen to be Council Member Andrew Roberto's birthday, so we just want to wish him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8993)|
| 2:29:59| happy birthday. Thank you for spending part of your birthday with us today. Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=8999)|
| 2:30:07| Vice Mayor. I was hoping to get out of the meeting without that being recognized, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9007)|
| 2:30:13| thank you very much. I can hear people downstairs moving things around, so I think my family has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9013)|
| 2:30:20| some plans for me at some point, but I can't think of a better way to spend your birthday than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9020)|
| 2:30:25| talking about economic development tips and pilots. Absolutely. Birthday dinner on the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9025)|
| 2:30:31| There you go. Happy birthday. Thank you. Okay. At this point, Mr. Johnson, do we have anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9031)|
| 2:30:36| signed up to speak for public forum? Yes, Vice Mayor, we have two persons signed up. Only one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9036)|
| 2:30:44| is in the pool. I'll allow Joe Petrie to speak. Mr. Petrie, I'm enabling you to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9044)|
| 2:30:52| Thank you. Can you hear me? We can. If you would give us your name and address, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9052)|
| 2:30:55| for the record. My name is Joe Petrie. I own Conversion Properties at 520 West Summit Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9055)|
| 2:31:01| downtown Knoxville, in the Langley Building. I'm sorry. You'll have up to five minutes. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9061)|
| 2:31:07| Thank you. I'll be really brief. I wasn't sure whether there was a public forum, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9067)|
| 2:31:11| unfortunately, when I represent my own firm, myself as an owner in downtown properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9071)|
| 2:31:18| and many times when we come before you, the only time we really get to come before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9078)|
| 2:31:22| to talk about tips or pilots is when we're asking for one, and so I thought it was a great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9082)|
| 2:31:27| opportunity to at least weigh in a little bit and make a couple of important points from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9087)|
| 2:31:32| development community. The first is that although there's many misperceptions about it, there is no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9092)|
| 2:31:40| downside to tips and pilots. I think the public sometimes looks at these as some form of a handout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9100)|
| 2:31:47| or something to the development community, but these are true incentives, and in our case of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9107)|
| 2:31:53| working on and developing in the development process of over $80 million in downtown and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9113)|
| 2:31:59| close into downtown, projects like Southeastern Glass, Taylor Lofts, Cal Johnson, which was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9119)|
| 2:32:08| mentioned earlier, Regas Square, Tyson Court, 200 Jennings, the list goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9128)|
| 2:32:14| Important point about a couple of those is Taylor Lofts, which is the corner of Union and Gay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9134)|
| 2:32:20| if you need a reference there, and then the Cal Johnson building on State Street. Those are two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9140)|
| 2:32:24| of Knoxville's oldest properties in downtown. In other words, Taylor Lofts survived the million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9144)|
| 2:32:30| dollar fire in 1871 building. Cal Johnson was 1905, and we all know its historic significance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9150)|
| 2:32:39| In those cases, those buildings could not have been done any other way without layers of incentives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9159)|
| 2:32:46| of which the pilots were one, and so the owners maintained those buildings and will own them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9166)|
| 2:32:54| maybe for many, many years to come. That's the plan, but those buildings could not have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9174)|
| 2:32:59| done any other way, so you have an incentive that's built from a community benefit is so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9179)|
| 2:33:07| important because when we were talking about jobs creation, most of, even though we perceive some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9187)|
| 2:33:14| these as condo and apartment developments, so they're predominantly housing, in the downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9194)|
| 2:33:19| market, there's always a retail component of that. So those are any retail restaurant may produce 50| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9199)|
| 2:33:27| to 100 jobs, something like that. Our client, Axel Logistics, is one of the very best projects that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9207)|
| 2:33:33| know as a job creator that was produced, you know, through in part of the incentive from a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9213)|
| 2:33:41| We'll finish that. The old Hull Dobbs building, we'll be finishing that in January, and I look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9221)|
| 2:33:47| forward very much to seeing all of you at the grand opening because it couldn't have been done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9227)|
| 2:33:53| otherwise, but that started when I met Axel five years ago, I guess it was. They had eight employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9233)|
| 2:34:01| They're local guys. They had eight employees, but they could put their company anywhere they want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9241)|
| 2:34:06| and this building is built to hold 300 plus employees. By the time they move in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9246)|
| 2:34:12| they'll have 105, and they're waiting to hire because they're out of room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9252)|
| 2:34:17| and cannot hire anymore. To me, the community benefit is very simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9257)|
| 2:34:24| Cities, we don't have the benefit of annexation anymore. We can't, no one that I know wants to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9264)|
| 2:34:33| raise the tax. Mr. Petrie, we've lost your audio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9273)|
| 2:34:48| Can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you. Hello? Okay, I'm sorry. So, I'm not sure where I was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9288)|
| 2:34:55| but basically, the community benefit is that these projects could not be done otherwise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9295)|
| 2:35:04| but yet they grow the tax base long term. So, if you're not going to raise taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9304)|
| 2:35:09| you have to grow the values in the densest areas that you can, and that predominantly has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9309)|
| 2:35:17| in downtown Knoxville. So, I wanted to speak to a couple of those points just because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9317)|
| 2:35:23| we rarely get to say that, although it's part of our public case, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9323)|
| 2:35:30| In the case of TIFs, those dollars are direct loans, and those loan dollars go toward the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9330)|
| 2:35:37| public benefit. So, we're very, very careful when we are drawing those monies from the loans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9337)|
| 2:35:43| to put them into the public infrastructure that we're required to, and in many cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9343)|
| 2:35:49| that truly is public infrastructure because often in redevelopment districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9349)|
| 2:35:54| the infrastructure doesn't keep up with the demand of development. So, we are using those dollars for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9354)|
| 2:36:01| stormwater or sidewalks or streetlights, and Regus is a great example of probably two out of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9361)|
| 2:36:09| three. Axle's an example of stormwater, a current project that I'm working on that should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9369)|
| 2:36:19| unnamed right now. We'll be having to increase the stormwater or we'll be lengthening the flow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9379)|
| 2:36:29| to where the city actually can pick it up. So, I just wanted to make sure that we were talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9389)|
| 2:36:36| about not only the public benefit through infrastructure, but also through job creation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9396)|
| 2:36:45| and then that the fact is that these projects that couldn't be done otherwise actually provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877?start=9405)|
