| 0:14:11| Thank You madam clerk. I did not denote on my copy here Commissioner Anders. Yes, sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=851)|
| 0:14:16| I just want to make a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=856)|
| 0:14:19| Statement I guess on this when you look at the resolution on our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=859)|
| 0:14:23| Agenda, it has a resolution from the school board, which is correct. But the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=863)|
| 0:14:28| That we're to vote on tonight. I'm showing on ours is is from tassel fight property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=868)|
| 0:14:34| so it's an old resolution is there can you check that and make sure that we're voting on the same because the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=874)|
| 0:14:39| The one signed by the school board is the rural high school. But the other one is did you see that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=879)|
| 0:14:43| Anybody else see that or my?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=883)|
| 0:14:46| So the resolution before us is M is for the tassel pipe proper. We got rid of a couple of months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=886)|
| 0:14:51| Okay, so we need to correct their emotion of no recommendation. Yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=891)|
| 0:14:56| without recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=896)|
| 0:15:01| Second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=901)|
| 0:15:05| Motion is properly before us to move this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=905)|
| 0:15:08| resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=908)|
| 0:15:09| To full Commission no recommendation pending the proper wording of the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=909)|
| 0:15:17| Seeing no further discussion all in favor say aye. Aye opposed. No motion carries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=917)|
| 0:15:26| Madam clerk on page 14 item 51 is a resolution approving a lease agreement in the amount of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=926)|
| 0:15:32| $2,000 per month with John Kay Chesney for the Carter convenience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=932)|
| 0:15:38| I think that's Commissioner Smith. Yes, sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=938)|
| 0:15:43| Before I say anything. I want everybody to know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=943)|
| 0:15:46| Especially you mr. Chairman that I have been many times to the Carter recycling solid waste facility and it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=946)|
| 0:15:53| Woefully inadequate and we do need to do something to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=953)|
| 0:15:57| Help the residents in that area to have a first-rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=957)|
| 0:16:00| Solid waste drop-off center. I I'm a little troubled by a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=960)|
| 0:16:05| Lease a 10-year lease where we wind up paying almost the value of the property. I want to make sure we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=965)|
| 0:16:12| Looked at everything we could to try to find a piece of property in that area to where we could actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=972)|
| 0:16:17| Build a facility because it's my understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=977)|
| 0:16:20| If we lease a piece of property we will develop it differently than if we own the piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=980)|
| 0:16:25| To some degree with the quality of the infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=985)|
| 0:16:29| Did we ever engage? I think about a year ago the county got a buyer's agent broker contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=989)|
| 0:16:37| Did we engage that that broker to seek out a piece of land for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=997)|
| 0:16:42| Recognized Dwight Vandervaet. Thank You. Mr. Vandervaet. Thank You. Mr. Chairman Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1002)|
| 0:16:47| I'm not sure. I'd probably need to defer to purchasing as to whether or not we use the broker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1007)|
| 0:16:51| I do know that purchasing did not one but two RF eyes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1011)|
| 0:16:56| where they posted the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1016)|
| 0:16:58| specific parameters that we were looking for in the area in which we were looking for potential sites and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1018)|
| 0:17:05| Received no responses to either one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1025)|
| 0:17:08| And we also did some staff searches just within the the radius or the area that we felt was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1028)|
| 0:17:15| the one that best served the needs of the community and avoid duplication with other centers and that sort of thing and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1035)|
| 0:17:21| Had a couple perspective sites, but none of those were for sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1041)|
| 0:17:25| and then one of the the ones that we did identify potentially and we thought about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1045)|
| 0:17:30| Approaching the owners turned out to have issues with the blue line stream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1050)|
| 0:17:33| so at the end of the day, we have we have put this under the lens for probably a period of about two years now and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1053)|
| 0:17:41| really struggled to find a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1061)|
| 0:17:43| suitable alternative to the site that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1063)|
| 0:17:46| Could someone please explain the RFI process and purchasing? Sure. I think Karen or Matt's here probably do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1066)|
| 0:17:55| Ben charbles here to not to overlook anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1075)|
| 0:17:58| Matt Myers knots County Procurement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1078)|
| 0:18:02| 1,000 North Central Street Commissioner Smith the RFI process is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1082)|
| 0:18:06| We'll send out to everybody that's in our vendor list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| We try to contact some of the other people who may be interested it lists what the county's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1089)|
| 0:18:15| Looking for it's not necessarily an RFP where we ask for price or bid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1095)|
| 0:18:21| We're just looking for pieces of property that may suit the needs that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1101)|
| 0:18:25| Pieces of property that may suit the needs that we have and as Dwight said nobody responded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1105)|
| 0:18:32| When you say you send it out to all of your vendors there any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1112)|
| 0:18:35| Realtor brokerage firms on that list. I don't have that list with me. I'd have to I can check for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1115)|
| 0:18:41| We've been said yes, we did. Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1121)|
| 0:18:45| Did we reach out we do have a contract for a buyer's agent that we put in place about a year ago. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1125)|
| 0:18:55| We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1135)|
| 0:18:58| Do and that happened to Ben charble supervisor property development it did happen a little less than a year ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1138)|
| 0:19:05| We put out a RFP for a term contract RFQ for a term contract for real estate brokerage services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1145)|
| 0:19:12| so we do have that on contract, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1152)|
| 0:19:15| The RFIs went out long before this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1155)|
| 0:19:18| That contract was put in place, but we never had that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1158)|
| 0:19:22| Vendor under contract do any searching for us, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1162)|
| 0:19:26| Okay, that one of the things that troubles me is I'm not a lease when you can buy kind of person and I wonder if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1166)|
| 0:19:34| If we have success in Midway and we have a lot of growth out there if we can't find a piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1174)|
| 0:19:39| Today, what are we going to do in 10 20 years the long range?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1179)|
| 0:19:44| Are we just passing this problem down to another administration to another Commission because none of us will be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1184)|
| 0:19:50| Is there any way when does our current lease expire?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1190)|
| 0:19:57| October of this coming year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1197)|
| 0:20:00| 2017 and how long would it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1200)|
| 0:20:05| So we have a roughly another year at our current site under its current size, correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1205)|
| 0:20:11| When does this lease take effect January 1 so we can build out correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1211)|
| 0:20:17| How long is the projected build-out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1217)|
| 0:20:25| Commissioner we're going to keep the center open during the time that we expand and improve it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1225)|
| 0:20:30| So it might be a little longer than you would think but I would say six to nine months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1230)|
| 0:20:35| Okay, I was just trying to see if maybe there was time we could search a little bit more before we make this 10-year commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1235)|
| 0:20:41| You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1241)|
| 0:20:44| If if I could share just a couple thoughts with you that that have come up actually commissioner since you and I talked about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1244)|
| 0:20:50| last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1250)|
| 0:20:52| One thing in terms of the lease rate that I know has been of concern to a couple members of the Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1252)|
| 0:20:58| And I think this has been a topic of discussion in the mayor's office as well. I would want to remind the Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1258)|
| 0:21:04| We're actually significantly expanding the footprint of property that we're leasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1264)|
| 0:21:09| Drew Thurman pointed out this morning that the actual cost per acre under the proposed lease is less than the cost per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1269)|
| 0:21:17| We're paying now the difference is we're leasing considerably more property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1277)|
| 0:21:21| But our actual hard cost per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1281)|
| 0:21:24| Under the terms of the new lease will be slightly less than the cost per acre that we're paying into the present lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1284)|
| 0:21:29| the other thing I'd ask you to think about when you think about a convenience center and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1289)|
| 0:21:35| Generally speaking if we could buy we would prefer we we did solicit the opportunity for mr. Chesney his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1295)|
| 0:21:43| Unwilling to subdivide the property to suit the county's needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1303)|
| 0:21:45| We would have to buy it in total and then subdivided ourselves. The property has existing businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1305)|
| 0:21:52| That would be impacted and the complexity of that is it's pretty substantial both for purchasing and it's certainly pretty substantial for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1312)|
| 0:21:59| And we definitely do not want to be in the the landlord business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1319)|
| 0:22:03| There's a mechanic shop and things like that out there that are unrelated to our needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1323)|
| 0:22:09| The the real asset that we're bringing to you in this lease is a site where we can manage the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1329)|
| 0:22:16| municipal waste stream of the constituents that live there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1336)|
| 0:22:20| Over the over the term of the lease those numbers are pretty substantial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1340)|
| 0:22:25| and I just wanted to run through those with you real quickly so you'd understand that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1345)|
| 0:22:29| The facility is the site or the host| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1349)|
| 0:22:31| But the real deliverable that we bring you is the ability to manage the garbage and the recyclables of the folks that live in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1351)|
| 0:22:39| Currently, we're turning about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1359)|
| 0:22:41| 3,700 visits a week. So just running the math out. That's almost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1361)|
| 0:22:46| 200,000 visits a year so we'd have almost 2 million visits over the 10 years that this lease would be in place. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1366)|
| 0:22:55| 2 million visits from Commissioner Wright's constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1375)|
| 0:22:59| Mr. Daley's constituents use the facility as well and then other folks that come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1379)|
| 0:23:07| Over the course of a year will process almost 4,000 tons of garbage. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1387)|
| 0:23:13| that's going to be 40,000 tons over the course of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1393)|
| 0:23:18| 10 years pretty substantial and and I just ask you to focus on the fact that that our delivery of the service is really what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1398)|
| 0:23:26| What the investment is not so much the real property because in the in the course of the 10 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1406)|
| 0:23:33| What matters most to us is the ability to give people a clean convenient and efficient place where they can come with their solid waste| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1413)|
| 0:23:40| and their recyclables, which we should always promote and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1420)|
| 0:23:44| And have all the services that the others do in the other six centers that we operate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1424)|
| 0:23:50| I wasn't questioning the need for the center or the volume of the disposal they do. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1430)|
| 0:23:57| again, I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| Would rather see taxpayers dollars put in this to a hard asset that if in 10 years we outgrow that site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| We have something to show for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1445)|
| 0:24:10| Commissioner Schoonmaker Thank You. Mr. Chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1450)|
| 0:24:13| How many acres do we have at the new Carnes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1453)|
| 0:24:17| Convenience Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1457)|
| 0:24:19| Let me ask Tom or drew to field that I don't recollect it's a slightly larger footprint than this one. I think it's about four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1459)|
| 0:24:30| Yeah, just slightly under four and how long did it take once you had possession of the property to do the completion at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1470)|
| 0:24:37| Took the probably the better part of a year to get it constructed, but it had a lot of site work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1477)|
| 0:24:43| There were a lot of topographical issues a lot of grading went on at the Carnes site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1483)|
| 0:24:49| So it had complexities in construction that the Carter site will not have and it's bigger to frankly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1489)|
| 0:24:54| Well, and that's that's my point is I think you set a standard of excellence there when you opened up that facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1494)|
| 0:25:01| It's awesome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1501)|
| 0:25:02| And people who have not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1502)|
| 0:25:03| Been out there need to drive by and see that and to see that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1503)|
| 0:25:07| Now we're going in a direction to less than half that size for our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1507)|
| 0:25:12| I just don't I just don't understand that I mean you what you've laid out in the way the solid waste department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1512)|
| 0:25:18| Did that facility should be a blueprint for the future of Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1518)|
| 0:25:22| I don't think we should be taking a step backwards putting it on a smaller site. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1522)|
| 0:25:28| Mean surely we can find four acres in the ninth district to hold a solid waste center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1528)|
| 0:25:34| Well, this one actually would serve the eighth district commissioner, but let me mention that that's what I meant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1534)|
| 0:25:41| This is this is actually a place where size is less relevant than design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1541)|
| 0:25:46| the highest volume center that we operate of the seven is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1546)|
| 0:25:51| Dutchtown it is the highest volume center that we operate in terms of tonnage. It is the highest volume center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1551)|
| 0:25:56| We operate in terms of visits. It is also physically the smallest site of the centers that we own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1556)|
| 0:26:02| and it runs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1562)|
| 0:26:04| Pretty efficiently it you know, it has its traffic challenges. Yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1564)|
| 0:26:08| It has its traffic challenges, there's no doubt but it manages a lot of visitors and a lot of waste| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1568)|
| 0:26:16| The biggest center that we operate is probably the Hall Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1576)|
| 0:26:20| It has a lot of acreage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| The case could be made that the acreage is actually slightly excessive in some cases because we use it to store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1583)|
| 0:26:29| Equipment that we otherwise couldn't store it Baxter Avenue and things like that simply because we have available space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1589)|
| 0:26:35| But we're confident for Carter that that we have more than enough space to accommodate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1595)|
| 0:26:41| Both current and future demands. I'm far less confident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1601)|
| 0:26:45| This is the the most recent of the last two centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1605)|
| 0:26:49| Carnes and Carter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| It should come as no surprise to this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1611)|
| 0:26:54| citing a convenience center is not an easy thing to do and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1614)|
| 0:26:59| people generally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1619)|
| 0:27:00| Everybody wants a convenience center, but nobody wants it as a neighbor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1620)|
| 0:27:04| everybody wants a convenience center, but nobody wants to be able to hear it see it or smell it and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1624)|
| 0:27:10| Citing one at a brand new location is not an easy thing to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1630)|
| 0:27:15| So I guess if Commission wants us to go in that direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1635)|
| 0:27:20| I would caution you that I think is going to be a multi-year commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1640)|
| 0:27:25| I don't know that I can even assure this body that it would be completed before the end of the mayor's term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1645)|
| 0:27:31| Well, if we had four acres at Dutchtown that would be an awesome facility and it would be handled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1651)|
| 0:27:38| smoothly and efficiently and you wouldn't have the backup and you'd have the area to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1658)|
| 0:27:44| have people unload in a you know, safe and proper manner, so I'm not a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1664)|
| 0:27:50| Kind of guess I agree with mr. Smith. I don't think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1670)|
| 0:27:54| you've got enough land to do what you need to do and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1674)|
| 0:27:57| To me I just hate for us to get into something that's a 10-year deal and then five years from now we find out we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1677)|
| 0:28:04| Messed up. Well, actually, I'm glad you mentioned that let me just remove I should remind Commission and I apologize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1684)|
| 0:28:10| I should have done this at the start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| We do have at any point in time a six-month right to cancel this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1692)|
| 0:28:15| I mean one of the things that you should always consider about a convenience center is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1695)|
| 0:28:19| That we can stand here with relative confidence and I can tell this Commission that the location in question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1699)|
| 0:28:25| Makes sense based on what we know today and we can reasonably project for the next five or ten years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1705)|
| 0:28:34| Personally, I think any forecast past ten years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1714)|
| 0:28:38| Becomes less of an educated guess and more of a guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1718)|
| 0:28:42| One of the reasons we were comfortable leasing when Carter is because there is an awful lot of undeveloped land more undeveloped land in Carter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1722)|
| 0:28:49| than there is in any other part of the county and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1729)|
| 0:28:51| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1731)|
| 0:28:52| Someday, obviously ten years from now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1732)|
| 0:28:55| Our successors may be sitting there looking at this site thinking it doesn't make the sense then that it does now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1735)|
| 0:29:01| So should five years from now this site not make sense or ten years from now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1741)|
| 0:29:07| This site not make sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1747)|
| 0:29:09| We do have the option to cancel the lease upon six months notice to the property owner and relocate the center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1749)|
| 0:29:16| Obviously, there's a cost associated with that and I wouldn't want to represent that there's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| But again, I'd ask you to focus on the fact that that Commissioner, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1759)|
| 0:29:25| Mr. Daly and other commissioners on the the fringe of the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1765)|
| 0:29:29| certainly even Commissioner Gill may have constituents that use these facilities and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1769)|
| 0:29:35| so the real asset is having that site where folks can go and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1775)|
| 0:29:40| And and manage their their their deeds in terms of their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1780)|
| 0:29:45| household waste| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1785)|
| 0:29:48| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1788)|
| 0:29:48| Commissioner Thomas. Thank you. Mr. Chairman. Mr. Vander Veidt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1788)|
| 0:29:52| That's why I was gonna bring up as I've read this you can get out of it at six months for any reason, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1792)|
| 0:29:58| Yes, sir. Yeah, that's what but they can as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| That's yeah, okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1801)|
| 0:30:03| But it's not like we're gonna be stuck in there for ten years or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1803)|
| 0:30:08| It is six months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1808)|
| 0:30:10| Let's say you did find the perfect piece of property is how fast could you move into or we take you six months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1810)|
| 0:30:17| You said six to nine months build-in, didn't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1817)|
| 0:30:20| Would we could if we found a piece of property and and started on day one to try to have it open in six months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1820)|
| 0:30:26| We would at least be able to handle garbage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| Yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1828)|
| 0:30:28| we might not have full compaction services for recyclables and things of that nature but garbage mixed metals and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1828)|
| 0:30:34| The core services that people count on certainly we could have it open and running in that right? Okay. Thank you very much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1834)|
| 0:30:41| Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1841)|
| 0:30:42| Thank You. Mr. Chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1842)|
| 0:30:44| The white house to the size I I do think two acres is is enough land that you can operate an efficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1844)|
| 0:30:52| solid waste site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1852)|
| 0:30:54| As to the sunken cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1854)|
| 0:30:57| What will we have in this piece of property to develop it out for a full operation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1857)|
| 0:31:04| Well, it'll yeah, obviously construction costs are an estimate but I would put it between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1864)|
| 0:31:09| 750,000 and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1869)|
| 0:31:11| $900,000 to get all the compactors in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1871)|
| 0:31:14| But those those are removable I'm talking about the infrastructure needed well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1874)|
| 0:31:19| Gosh, you know that I'd rather try to firm a figure up for you next week Commissioner some portions of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1879)|
| 0:31:24| Obviously can be moved but you know, they're there for 40 electrical systems that are in the ground in a center like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1884)|
| 0:31:31| There's reinforced concrete pads that in a center like this. Those are things that can't be moved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1891)|
| 0:31:35| Those truly are sunk costs compactors boxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1895)|
| 0:31:38| Heck even a little middle building that the operator sits in we can relocate all those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1898)|
| 0:31:44| The the electrical and the grade work and concrete things like that. Now those will be sunk costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1904)|
| 0:31:50| Okay, given given the where this site is and I'm by no means an expert on on Carter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1910)|
| 0:31:55| But I believe you have Asheville Highway Rutledge Pike and straw points all within a half mile right there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1915)|
| 0:32:02| Is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1922)|
| 0:32:03| Dave is it safe to say that that is probably going to be a pretty good location for a long time for this type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1923)|
| 0:32:08| service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1928)|
| 0:32:09| The current location is is the best we've come up with. Yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1929)|
| 0:32:15| One thing that does bother me as we go forward because you know, you mentioned it nobody wants one of these things next to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1935)|
| 0:32:22| as the Carter community grows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1942)|
| 0:32:26| On down the road. It's gonna be even harder to find a spot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1946)|
| 0:32:32| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1952)|
| 0:32:33| Don't disagree commissioner. It's been hard to find this one. We we've spent a lot of time looking and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1953)|
| 0:32:40| with purchasing support and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1960)|
| 0:32:43| Despite the fact that it is relatively undeveloped. It has been a tough place to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1963)|
| 0:32:48| To find one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| Carnes was very similar quite frankly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| If I didn't have a piece of property in the Forks of the River Industrial Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1972)|
| 0:32:55| That the owner of the Carnes property wanted we wouldn't have the Carnes Center today. He just wasn't gonna sell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1975)|
| 0:33:01| We traded for that site because we had a site that he wanted and that's the only way that we we ended up with a site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1981)|
| 0:33:08| That we did in Carnes. I would just say that to this Commission and and I think prospectively these things will probably get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1988)|
| 0:33:15| Increasingly difficult to site and commissioner Schoonmaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1995)|
| 0:33:18| I actually think that the public push will be to make them smaller and to reduce the footprint because again, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=1998)|
| 0:33:24| It's it's it's a facility everybody wants but nobody wants it near them and nobody wants to be able to see it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=2004)|
| 0:33:30| That's just in the nature of the garbage business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=2010)|
| 0:33:34| Commissioner Daly, thank you. Mr. Chair Dwight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=2014)|
| 0:33:39| The do we leasing do we lease any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=2019)|
| 0:33:43| Centers at this point in time. No, sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| this is the last one Carnes was previously a lease a site on Oak Ridge Highway and we traded for the new one and this will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=2025)|
| 0:33:51| be the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=2031)|
| 0:33:52| The last leased site that we have we have leased in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=2032)|
| 0:33:57| But this would currently be the only one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=2037)|
| 0:33:59| The the one it was John severe we own that that side at that point in time, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=2039)|
| 0:34:04| Yes, sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=2044)|
| 0:34:04| We own all the real property under every center except the Carter Center and it was closed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=2044)|
| 0:34:09| Like you said to go to Chapman Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| I guess my question is is I'm kind of concerned like Commissioner Smith about paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=2051)|
| 0:34:18| $240,000 for a piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=2058)|
| 0:34:20| Taxpayers money, but I know we got to have it. There's no the convenes. He's got to be there, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=2060)|
| 0:34:27| Hopefully that we can look forward in the future to find some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=2067)|
| 0:34:31| Convenient place to do that. Yes, sir. We'll we'll continue to be on the look and we did solicit the opportunity to buy this site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=2071)|
| 0:34:39| from mr. Chesney and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| Mr. Chesney did not feel that it was in his best interest to subdivide it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=2081)|
| 0:34:45| But but having said that let me say that we have leased to this site since the 1980s and mr| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=2085)|
| 0:34:51| Chesney has consistently dealt with us in good faith and gracious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=2091)|
| 0:34:56| Just could not ask for a better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| Business partner, so I just wouldn't want to put that on the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=2098)|
| 0:35:01| He doesn't want to subdivide it and sell us this footprint. It's his property. That's his prerogative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=2101)|
| 0:35:06| But in every respect he's negotiated with us in good faith and has been easy to work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=2106)|
| 0:35:13| As this particular issue has been before us for some years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=2113)|
| 0:35:20| Commissioner Anderson, I think it will agree with me and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=2120)|
| 0:35:26| as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=2126)|
| 0:35:27| we looked at the last two sites to be upgraded in Knox County was Carnes and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=2127)|
| 0:35:34| Carter first and they were also the worst to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=2134)|
| 0:35:38| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| Deal that was worked out to upgrade Carnes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=2140)|
| 0:35:43| Gave us money in hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=2143)|
| 0:35:46| That we've been trying to upgrade Carter ever since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=2146)|
| 0:35:50| It's not been something that is just coming on the agenda right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| This is something that's been being worked on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=2153)|
| 0:35:56| for years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=2156)|
| 0:35:59| Back at the time of which to do first I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=2159)|
| 0:36:03| committed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=2163)|
| 0:36:05| Commissioner Anders that I would travel to the site there in Carnes and and then I would give my opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=2165)|

| 0:48:38| Think the state will be trying to tackle internet internet sales tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=2918)|
| 0:48:43| Some are pushing back on it. I think as a body we need to let them know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=2923)|
| 0:48:49| Even though we're against all taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=2929)|
| 0:48:52| This is a tax. It's not a new a new new tax. This is a existing tax that needs to be collected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=2932)|
| 0:48:58| I think we were told at the last County Commissioners meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=2938)|
| 0:49:01| That the state's missing out on three to four hundred million dollars a year in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=2941)|
| 0:49:06| sales tax from the Internet if you look at Knox County and Knoxville, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=2946)|
| 0:49:11| Would say an easy estimate is that's 15 to 18 million dollars. We are missing out right here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=2951)|
| 0:49:16| We're 75 percent of that would go to our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=2956)|
| 0:49:20| Something's got to be done about the internet sales tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=2960)|
| 0:49:23| We live in a state where there are too many border towns that people can easily drive 10 miles for a lower sales tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=2963)|
| 0:49:31| We are a state that's limited to mainly our only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=2971)|
| 0:49:34| Revenue source is sales tax. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=2974)|
| 0:49:39| Think we need to try to push these guys to try to work within the borders to sure up something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=2979)|
| 0:49:49| Commissioner deal Thank You. Mr. Chairman. I have two issues. One is the broadband issue that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=2989)|
| 0:49:56| Will probably be on the agenda and the second one obviously concerns the issue of our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=2996)|
| 0:50:02| With the health costs that will increase for all teachers in this state at a minimum of 11%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3002)|
| 0:50:10| How are we going to pay for it? So that will impact a large amount of budget issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3010)|
| 0:50:18| that the school will have to bring forth to us because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3018)|
| 0:50:22| Mean I just I mean that is just the cost increase January the 1st the second one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3022)|
| 0:50:29| happens to be with obviously your teacher pay increase and how those two factors interplay with that, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3029)|
| 0:50:38| You know the issue of obviously education and vouchers and the impact of those issues are going to come before this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3038)|
| 0:50:45| Commissioner Carringer, thank you. Mr. Chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3045)|
| 0:50:53| Mine was about broadband also because when we were in Nashville for the County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3053)|
| 0:51:01| Conference that was a big topic and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3061)|
| 0:51:06| They had a whole section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| Just for that and and then to add to it that I've gotten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3069)|
| 0:51:14| Two three emails from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3074)|
| 0:51:16| People in my district and from outside the district where it doesn't so much impact Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3076)|
| 0:51:23| But it impacts the other counties that surround Knox County as a whole it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3083)|
| 0:51:30| Really affects the state of Tennessee so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3090)|
| 0:51:33| businesses can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3093)|
| 0:51:35| Produce that are already there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3095)|
| 0:51:37| but can't get broadband so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3097)|
| 0:51:41| And I know it came before state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3101)|
| 0:51:44| And last year and they turned it down so I feel sure that these other counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3104)|
| 0:51:51| Are going to push for them to bring it back up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3111)|
| 0:51:54| in this new year, so and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3114)|
| 0:51:58| Think that's important to see kind of why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3118)|
| 0:52:00| Why are where they're at on any of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3120)|
| 0:52:07| Thank You mr. Chair, I'd like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3127)|
| 0:52:09| Commissioner Bussler's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3129)|
| 0:52:11| Second is because being on BZA we and being out in the county we have a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3131)|
| 0:52:17| blighted properties that people are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3137)|
| 0:52:19| are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3139)|
| 0:52:20| Just letting run down their safety hazards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3140)|
| 0:52:25| The manufactured homes, there's no control over manufactured home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3145)|
| 0:52:29| We've made elderly people cry at BZA because we have no rules to govern them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3149)|
| 0:52:36| And they can come in and drop a mobile home. That's not inside the setbacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3156)|
| 0:52:41| and they have to come for a variance and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3161)|
| 0:52:44| You're putting the BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| Or not we it's putting a BZA in a position to where you do you deny an elderly couple's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3166)|
| 0:52:53| retirement income in a home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3173)|
| 0:52:55| because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3175)|
| 0:52:56| There's no really restrictions on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3176)|
| 0:52:59| The guy that drops the mobile manufactured mobile home off. He just drops it leaves. There's no recourse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3179)|
| 0:53:05| There's none of them rich enough to go out and sue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3185)|
| 0:53:08| You know that they got their life savings tied up already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3188)|
| 0:53:11| So that's very very important and I believe the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3191)|
| 0:53:15| I think coach has come before the law department trying to get a better teeth into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3195)|
| 0:53:21| Fines and things that to make these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3201)|
| 0:53:24| Step up and do what's right. Is that is that correct? Mr. Law Director? Do you remember that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3204)|
| 0:53:29| I know Roy Braden. I've talked to Roy Braden about it quite a bit a lot of these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3209)|
| 0:53:35| However are misdemeanors and they fall under the Sessions courts domain and that says constitutional limit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3215)|
| 0:53:42| the $50 fines that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3222)|
| 0:53:45| We you know, it just it is where it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3225)|
| 0:53:47| I don't know that the legislature would want to address the constitutional issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3227)|
| 0:53:52| But they may that would be the only way we could get to some of those civil fines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3232)|
| 0:53:57| Now, how does the city when they access access a fine or assess a fine or whatever that it's till| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3237)|
| 0:54:04| My understanding is until it's fixed. It could be per day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3244)|
| 0:54:07| Yeah for us in the county they have to go out every day and write a new citation every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3247)|
| 0:54:14| How can we fix it or can we fix that? I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3254)|
| 0:54:19| Don't know what they've been challenged on or how that they particularly done it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3259)|
| 0:54:23| But I do know that it is per incident and I don't think you can just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3263)|
| 0:54:28| Keep going out and having one citation and say it counts as 25| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3268)|
| 0:54:35| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3275)|
| 0:54:36| Look into that and see what they're doing, but I'm not so sure if that ran its course how far it would really get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3276)|
| 0:54:45| Commissioner nastum just to be brief to reference something we discussed previously in this session for the luncheon on Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3285)|
| 0:54:53| we may want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3293)|
| 0:54:55| Bring up what the focus points or what class is going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3295)|
| 0:54:59| Addressing when they're focusing on lobbying for our school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3299)|
| 0:55:02| That was the lobbyist group that our school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3302)|
| 0:55:04| Superintendent if they've got a particular agenda that they're going to be focusing on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3304)|
| 0:55:08| We may be able to help mirror or reflect. I think that might be helpful just to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3308)|
| 0:55:13| Get an update on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3313)|
| 0:55:16| if if we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3316)|
| 0:55:19| Look for things that affect the Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3319)|
| 0:55:22| I would hope that the Board of Education would bring that up as one of their two items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3322)|
| 0:55:26| Since we're since we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3326)|
| 0:55:29| We're all going to be there and we're going to be limited to I'm going to try to limit us to two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3329)|
| 0:55:37| Commissioner bustler I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3337)|
| 0:55:40| Was thank you. Mr. Chair. I was here earlier listening to the audit committee and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3340)|
| 0:55:46| They were talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3346)|
| 0:55:48| certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3348)|
| 0:55:50| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3350)|
| 0:55:51| Deflection or some things that they had that kept reoccurring in schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3351)|
| 0:55:56| One of the things that wasn't mentioned in the audit committee was charter schools now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3356)|
| 0:56:01| to my understanding charter schools are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3361)|
| 0:56:05| private schools for profit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3365)|
| 0:56:08| Yet we are forced if they wanted to to force a school in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3368)|
| 0:56:13| They said you have a charter school in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3373)|
| 0:56:16| That is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3376)|
| 0:56:18| taxpayers money going to a private industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3378)|
| 0:56:22| That we have no control over is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3382)|
| 0:56:26| there anything that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3386)|
| 0:56:27| We want to bring up about that because that's some big bucks if they drop a couple of schools in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3387)|
| 0:56:34| And we have no controls to make them follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3394)|
| 0:56:36| I guess state statutes on how they control their money inside those schools. So is that an issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3396)|
| 0:56:42| We want to try to tackle too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3402)|
| 0:56:45| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3405)|
| 0:56:46| Would offer to you that charter schools would probably be an issue raised by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3406)|
| 0:56:54| Local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3414)|
| 0:56:55| Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| We've sometimes entered into their work when we talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3417)|
| 0:57:02| Bricks and mortar, but we've never really entered into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3422)|
| 0:57:08| Curricula or how they operate but my point is is this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3428)|
| 0:57:14| We are spending taxpayers dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3434)|
| 0:57:19| For something we don't have we're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3439)|
| 0:57:24| We don't have any other course, but to fund the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3444)|
| 0:57:29| and they take the money with the kids that go to those schools and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3449)|
| 0:57:33| If it's going to a private school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3453)|
| 0:57:36| Which those are basically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3456)|
| 0:57:40| Do we have an obligation to fund that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3460)|
| 0:57:43| it's my question the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3463)|
| 0:57:45| The charter school that's in Knox County at the current time is not is a non-profit. Yeah, so it's not a private school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3465)|
| 0:57:54| It's not a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3474)|
| 0:57:55| Mr. Chairman, I can help answer that question because Knox County has charter schools is the issue of the voucher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3475)|
| 0:58:03| That is what I was speaking to earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3483)|
| 0:58:06| We actually have charter schools in Knox County the issue becomes the voucher because the money follows the child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3486)|
| 0:58:13| So that really is the issue you're concerned with and maybe Knox County schools will have that as one of their agenda items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3493)|
| 0:58:21| last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3501)|
| 0:58:23| we had a little bit more time to get prepared for this and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3503)|
| 0:58:26| the school board and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3506)|
| 0:58:29| County Commission had a list I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3509)|
| 0:58:31| seven eight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3511)|
| 0:58:33| Joint items that we both bodies unanimously approved. We don't have time to do that this year. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3513)|
| 0:58:39| Hope that the school system is coming up with their two major points and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3519)|
| 0:58:46| We should try to stick to things that affect the county more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3526)|
| 0:58:52| Commissioner Anders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| Yeah, I want to go a little bit back on what Randy was saying about sales tax and an internet tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3534)|
| 0:58:59| I think it's important that our delegation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3539)|
| 0:59:02| Hears us and understands that every tax decrease that they do on the state level funnels down to the local level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3542)|
| 0:59:08| Getting over it of the haul income tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3548)|
| 0:59:11| While to be celebrated it affects our bottom line, and they'll never make us whole on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3551)|
| 0:59:16| they say they will never have and so those are some of the things and then when you go back and you look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3556)|
| 0:59:22| The situs work for I mean we have to pay somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3562)|
| 0:59:27| To correct the count of the state's mistakes on paying our sales tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3567)|
| 0:59:32| Back into Knox County, and so I mean we're paying somebody that to fix their work because they won't release where the sales tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3572)|
| 0:59:39| Is coming from so every time they cut taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3579)|
| 0:59:43| Which you know is you know a celebrated thing it affects us and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3583)|
| 0:59:48| Well, I think they need to understand how it affects us and that sales tax the internet sales tax affects us greatly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3588)|
| 0:59:54| And so I think I think that needs to be a point of contention for our delegation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3594)|
| 0:59:58| But I think that contract calls for I think the first fifty thousand dollars recovered by that person that has that contract goes to that person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3598)|
| 1:00:05| Yeah, I mean they get exceedingly more than that, but why should we have to pay fifty thousand dollars for the state to give us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3605)|
| 1:00:11| Our sales tax money in the right place and so those are some things that we need to talk about I mean they started tech| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3611)|
| 1:00:17| Collecting business tax and our business tax revenues went way down since then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3617)|
| 1:00:21| So I mean there's a lot of you know cutting taxes and streamlining and on the on the state side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3621)|
| 1:00:27| And doing what they're doing. I mean they've taken away from us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3627)|
| 1:00:30| Real dollars which affects people at their doorstep, and I think they need to understand that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3630)|
| 1:00:36| Commissioner Thomas Thank You mr. Chairman. I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3636)|
| 1:00:39| remember last year we kind of felt like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3639)|
| 1:00:42| Money was coming to take care of our mental health issues in East Tennessee and that we do not need to use that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3642)|
| 1:00:48| As one of our topics is kind of what's been for this year that there's going to be a push for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3648)|
| 1:00:54| But I think we all need to make sure that all through the year or through their session that we really do make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3654)|
| 1:01:02| That's something that we're all on top of even if we don't talk about it next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3662)|
| 1:01:07| But it's something that we have to have and I know it's inferred again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3667)|
| 1:01:12| It's most likely gonna be in the budget this year, but I thought it was gonna be in the budget last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3672)|
| 1:01:17| So I think we just do need to stay on top of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3677)|
| 1:01:24| Any other items that people would like to mention for discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3684)|
| 1:01:31| If not let me run down, I've tried to keep up with them as they were offered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3691)|
| 1:01:37| Commissioner Bussler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3697)|
| 1:01:39| opened with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3699)|
| 1:01:41| What was what I refer to as fuel tax, but what I also call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3701)|
| 1:01:47| Roads and infrastructure of the two things that business come to Tennessee for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3707)|
| 1:01:55| The first thing they come for is an educated workforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3715)|
| 1:01:59| The second thing they come to Tennessee for is that they can have an ease of getting around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3719)|
| 1:02:05| Getting their product out of the state of Tennessee or into the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3725)|
| 1:02:09| That's the main reason people come to Tennessee. So I I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3729)|
| 1:02:15| Envision that speaking of roads, which is then followed by how do you fund them would be one of our number one product?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3735)|
| 1:02:23| Priorities if we're and I've got a limit us to two because that's what representative Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3743)|
| 1:02:29| Asked me for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3749)|
| 1:02:32| Moving on with Commissioner Bussler it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3752)|
| 1:02:35| school zonings I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3755)|
| 1:02:38| Believe that I would defer to the Board of Education when it comes to zoning schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3758)|
| 1:02:43| You spoke of how some codes affect us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3763)|
| 1:02:48| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3768)|
| 1:02:49| specifically went to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3769)|
| 1:02:50| manufactured housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3770)|
| 1:02:53| The the next was offered by Commissioner Smith, but also echoed by a couple of others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3773)|
| 1:02:59| relates to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3779)|
| 1:03:00| revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3780)|
| 1:03:02| Now where you want to call it sales tax or whether you want to call it anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3782)|
| 1:03:07| Revenue is a pretty big deal to us. If I go order a pair of boots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3787)|
| 1:03:14| And I go down to the local boot man and buy them. I pay sales tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3794)|
| 1:03:20| If I go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3800)|
| 1:03:22| Some place that comes by FedEx I may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3802)|
| 1:03:27| Illegally be able to avoid the collection of that tax. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3807)|
| 1:03:33| Don't think that that needs to be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3813)|
| 1:03:36| Situation that exists in Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3816)|
| 1:03:38| I believe that if you go buy something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3818)|
| 1:03:40| The way we in Tennessee would like to see it is that sales tax is paid on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3820)|
| 1:03:45| As is lawful is as is lawfully required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3825)|
| 1:03:49| So I sort of put a checkmark beside that one. We also spoke| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3829)|
| 1:03:55| Commissioner Gill spoke to broadband| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3835)|
| 1:03:58| school health dollars again the word school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3838)|
| 1:04:01| Commissioner Gill also spoke to teacher pay and and teacher pay increases as being a part of an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3841)|
| 1:04:09| MOU that exists and should be honored, but I don't know how we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3849)|
| 1:04:14| Approach the state legislature about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3854)|
| 1:04:20| Outside of the school district doing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3860)|
| 1:04:23| Again broadband was discussed by Commissioner Carringer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3863)|
| 1:04:28| mobile homes were brought up again by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3868)|
| 1:04:31| But it was as a result of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3871)|
| 1:04:34| speaking of code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3874)|
| 1:04:37| Commissioner Daly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3877)|
| 1:04:39| Spoke to class which is a part of the education system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3879)|
| 1:04:45| Bustler back to charter schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3885)|
| 1:04:48| Commissioner Anders spoke to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3888)|
| 1:04:52| Revenue and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3892)|
| 1:04:54| then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3894)|
| 1:04:55| Commissioner Thomas spoke to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3895)|
| 1:04:58| Dollars for mental health was that addressed in one of the weekly call one of the weekly TV programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3898)|
| 1:05:05| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3905)|
| 1:05:07| Think I heard a yes, I believe I saw that also Commissioner Smith. Yes representative Smith was I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3907)|
| 1:05:15| proposing three avenues for revenue source on this and I know that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3915)|
| 1:05:20| the mayor has had a meeting with a couple of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3920)|
| 1:05:24| Representatives from the Knox County delegation on this topic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3924)|
| 1:05:27| I think we're far more in front of it than we were this time last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3927)|
| 1:05:30| And I think that's a ball that's being carried by Eddie Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3930)|
| 1:05:34| Commissioner so the governor has lem I believe has worked out a deal with Amazon when they built to build this new distribution center in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3934)|
| 1:05:41| Murfreesboro Amazon does collect taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3941)|
| 1:05:47| Pardon me. We got it this year the money, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3947)|
| 1:05:50| So if that's not the issue the internet sales tax is not the issue that it used to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3950)|
| 1:05:56| That's it's a growing. No, it's a growing issue on large market, but they are not the entirety of the internet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3956)|
| 1:06:04| Amazon is a large market, but they're not the entirety of the of the internet market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3964)|
| 1:06:10| They're trying to go after companies who have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3970)|
| 1:06:13| $500,000 a year's sales in the state of Tennessee and up there's several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3973)|
| 1:06:21| Things about this that I think people need to understand we are a state that derives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3981)|
| 1:06:27| most of its general funds from sales tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3987)|
| 1:06:31| Also the aspect of supporting small businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3991)|
| 1:06:36| The bricks and mortars mom-and-pops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3996)|
| 1:06:39| Are at a disadvantage. We don't want those to be just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=3999)|
| 1:06:43| Retail places where you go to look at the shoe and then you go home and buy it and save 10%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=4003)|
| 1:06:48| What happens is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=4008)|
| 1:06:51| Eventually, we won't have any mom-and-pop bricks and mortar stores. They'll just be some giant warehouses everywhere and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=4011)|
| 1:06:58| That will affect our real estate tax base| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=4018)|
| 1:07:03| And and and that that's a problem we could see in the future and you know, I look at I look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=4023)|
| 1:07:10| Tax free on the internet kind of the same way. I look at a pilot and a tiff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=4030)|
| 1:07:16| These laws were enacted in the 90s to try and get the startup of the internet going to get retail commerce on the internet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=4036)|
| 1:07:24| Well all tips and pilots eventually expire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=4044)|
| 1:07:26| I think that the concept of buying things online has truly taken hold and doesn't need any more incentive anymore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=4046)|
| 1:07:38| Commissioner Bessler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=4058)|
| 1:07:39| The the thing I was mentioned about the gas tax in and for our infrastructure that we're going to be looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=4059)|
| 1:07:47| attacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=4067)|
| 1:07:49| The way that they add it to gasoline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=4069)|
| 1:07:52| Does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=4072)|
| 1:07:54| increase our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=4074)|
| 1:07:57| regenerate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=4077)|
| 1:07:58| Where we don't have to revisit it like a sales tax the more you sell the more money you've got coming in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=4078)|
| 1:08:05| Now cars are getting more efficient. You've got electric cars out on the road now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=4085)|
| 1:08:09| How do you address that because they're using the same roads that we're paying tax on is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=4089)|
| 1:08:14| There a way that there's a funding out there that will grow as the economy grows besides the sales tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=4094)|
| 1:08:21| Because gasoline you're using less of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=4101)|
| 1:08:24| You're going to be using less of it the other thing about the schools and things like this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=4104)|
| 1:08:28| we're are charged to make sure that the taxpayers money is spent the best way and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=4108)|
| 1:08:34| Some of these things that they've issued at a state level. We have no control over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=4114)|
| 1:08:40| And I know schools one reason why it's separated because we had a big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=4120)|
| 1:08:45| difference between the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=4125)|
| 1:08:47| County Commission and the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=4127)|
| 1:08:50| But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=4130)|
| 1:08:51| When the state comes in and starts giving us stuff to do and it's like a proclamation non-funded mandates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=4131)|
| 1:08:59| Then that's a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=4139)|
| 1:09:00| I see that we've got to address because we're supposed to be representing our people and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=4140)|
| 1:09:05| Making sure their money spent properly and that's the reason I brought those up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=4145)|
| 1:09:10| And I think that goes back to what Brad was saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=4150)|
| 1:09:13| in a lot of ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=4153)|
| 1:09:16| What seems to have brought up the most discussion has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=4156)|
| 1:09:21| Roads and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=4161)|
| 1:09:24| Revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=4164)|
| 1:09:28| Let's go with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=4168)|
| 1:09:31| Does anyone want to offer that we should do something besides roads and revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=4171)|
| 1:09:42| What's the point I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=4182)|
| 1:09:45| I can't hear you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=4185)|
| 1:09:47| We need if we're going to discuss that. What is our bullet points? What are we going to say? Boom. Boom. Boom. This is what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=4187)|
| 1:09:54| Talking about this is what we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=4194)|
| 1:09:59| For our County I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=4199)|
| 1:10:01| Mean do we have specific ideas from anybody else if those are the two ideas we're going to talk about what are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=4201)|
| 1:10:08| specifically going to hit them with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=4208)|
| 1:10:11| Commissioner Anders you're gonna have about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=4211)|
| 1:10:13| 15| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=4213)|
| 1:10:15| Maybe 20 minutes to talk about them. It's not even gonna be I mean, we're gonna plant things in their mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=4215)|
| 1:10:21| We're not gonna| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=4221)|
| 1:10:22| Solve the world's problems at one lunch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=4222)|
| 1:10:24| I mean we should probably have a lunch with them by ourselves without the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161212?start=4224)|
