| 0:02:36| As you all are very well aware, one week ago today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=156)|
| 0:02:39| we were all learning about the gut-wrenching details of yet another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=159)|
| 0:02:42| mass shooting in our country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=162)|
| 0:02:44| Nineteen students and two teachers were gunned down inside of Rob| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=164)|
| 0:02:47| Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=167)|
| 0:02:50| So I want to begin my Mayor's report tonight with a moment of silence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=170)|
| 0:02:52| for the victims of that shooting and for the teenagers still recovering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=172)|
| 0:02:56| from a weekend shooting in our sister city of Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=176)|
| 0:03:00| So a moment of silence, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=180)|
| 0:03:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=195)|
| 0:03:17| So coming off Memorial Day weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=197)|
| 0:03:18| I also want to take a moment once again to thank and remember all of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=198)|
| 0:03:22| who paid the ultimate price while serving our country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=202)|
| 0:03:25| and that includes Army Staff Sergeant Ryan Knauss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=205)|
| 0:03:28| The Gibbs High School graduate was honored yesterday as his name was added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=208)|
| 0:03:31| at the East Tennessee Veterans Memorial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=211)|
| 0:03:33| So again, to the Knauss family and to all military families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=213)|
| 0:03:37| we say thank you for your sacrifice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=217)|
| 0:03:40| So I also, on a lighter note,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=220)|
| 0:03:42| wanted to mention to Council that last week members of my administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=222)|

| 0:03:49| had the opportunity to travel to Birmingham, Alabama,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=229)|

| 0:03:58| This is the first of three meetings and we interacted with other cities to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=238)|
| 0:04:01| discuss equity and economic barriers in our communities and solutions to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=241)|
| 0:04:05| address these disparities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=245)|
| 0:04:06| And we're looking forward to continuing these conversations and we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=246)|
| 0:04:10| committed to implementing solutions for the people of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=250)|

| 0:17:15| We had a lot of great help from Carlene Malone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| was a great help to us getting set up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1038)|
| 0:17:21| and starting and the right way to do things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1041)|
| 0:17:24| And Larry Cox and several others and Jack was one of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1044)|
| 0:17:29| to make sure we did things the right way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1049)|
| 0:17:31| I think we've always kind of felt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1051)|
| 0:17:33| that we've given equal opportunity to anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1053)|
| 0:17:36| that we had, I won't say issues, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1056)|
| 0:17:42| that developments, anything that was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1062)|
| 0:17:46| And that was from great leadership people like Jack Sharp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1066)|
| 0:17:50| He was a great mentor to our group and association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1070)|
| 0:17:54| and the last years after he's been on council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1074)|
| 0:17:59| I've run into Jack so many times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1079)|
| 0:18:01| and we've just become good friends and I miss him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1081)|
| 0:18:04| He was a great man and I always enjoyed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1084)|
| 0:18:07| I couldn't go to the store without finding them both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1087)|
| 0:18:10| walking around at the same time and always together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1090)|
| 0:18:14| and stuff and I always enjoy just sitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1094)|
| 0:18:17| and talking with him and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1097)|
| 0:18:18| So much history with him and friendship and stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1098)|
| 0:18:22| and I just thought it was worth it to come down here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1102)|
| 0:18:24| just to speak about Jack, he was a great man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1104)|
| 0:18:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1108)|
| 0:18:30| Thank you, Mr. Collins, Vice Mayor, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1110)|
| 0:18:33| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1113)|
| 0:18:35| I also wanted to just thank Dora Sharp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1115)|
| 0:18:37| for being here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1117)|
| 0:18:40| All of us that are sitting up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1120)|
| 0:18:42| and anyone who's served on council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1122)|
| 0:18:44| understands the demands this job has for the families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1124)|
| 0:18:48| and so I just wanted to take a moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| and recognize everything that Doris has been there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1130)|
| 0:18:53| to support Jack throughout his time serving on council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1133)|
| 0:18:58| I also want to recognize that his nephew,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1138)|
| 0:19:00| Jack's nephew, Steve Sharp and his wife, Jeannie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1140)|
| 0:19:04| also in attendance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1144)|
| 0:19:06| Jack served on council for 28 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1146)|
| 0:19:09| the last 14 of which served as Vice Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1149)|
| 0:19:12| which is the longest serving Vice Mayor in the city's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1152)|
| 0:19:15| history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1155)|
| 0:19:17| Jack will be deeply missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1157)|
| 0:19:19| I remember, I can't think of meetings that I've gone to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1159)|
| 0:19:24| where I didn't see Jack there for a breakfast meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1164)|
| 0:19:28| Or a lunch meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1168)|
| 0:19:29| So he was very involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1169)|
| 0:19:31| He will be deeply missed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1171)|
| 0:19:32| and I always really admired his heart for service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1172)|
| 0:19:36| Just wanted to take a minute to thank him for all he did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1176)|
| 0:19:40| and all the support his family showed him and allowed him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1180)|
| 0:19:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1183)|
| 0:19:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1186)|
| 0:19:47| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1187)|
| 0:19:50| Just wanted to say that Jack was my client| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1190)|
| 0:19:53| for more than 20 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1193)|
| 0:19:55| while he served as Vice Mayor and as council member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1195)|
| 0:19:59| And I've never had a client that I enjoyed more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1199)|
| 0:20:03| had more fun with, or that racked me more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1203)|
| 0:20:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1209)|
| 0:20:10| I also had the opportunity to see him in action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1210)|
| 0:20:13| in his time on city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1213)|
| 0:20:15| but also in planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1215)|
| 0:20:17| And I just wanted to also say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1217)|
| 0:20:19| when I was running for office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1219)|
| 0:20:21| I knocked on the door of the Sharp family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1221)|
| 0:20:24| and it was a hot, hot day like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1224)|
| 0:20:26| My husband and I were campaigning together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1226)|
| 0:20:29| just like I'm sure you and Jack did at times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1229)|
| 0:20:32| And you welcomed us in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1232)|
| 0:20:34| you gave us something cold to drink,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1234)|
| 0:20:36| and then you regaled us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1236)|
| 0:20:37| with lots of interesting historical anecdotes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1237)|
| 0:20:41| about Knoxville and politics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1241)|
| 0:20:43| and the warmth of your marriage and your home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1243)|
| 0:20:47| was palpable and very much appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1247)|
| 0:20:51| And I know that he's very missed by you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1251)|
| 0:20:55| and by our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1255)|
| 0:20:56| So we're thankful for his service and for your family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1256)|
| 0:21:01| Go to council member Ryder and then council member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1261)|
| 0:21:06| Oh, I'm sorry, it was Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1266)|
| 0:21:08| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1268)|
| 0:21:09| I had the pleasure of serving with Jack| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1269)|
| 0:21:11| for his last two years on city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1271)|
| 0:21:14| And most of the time he was a ball of fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1274)|
| 0:21:17| I sat right here and Jack was sitting over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1277)|
| 0:21:20| I think where council member Custer sits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1280)|
| 0:21:23| And Jack and I would make eye contact with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1283)|
| 0:21:26| You could tell when he's up no good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| because of the glint in his eye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1288)|
| 0:21:30| But kind of like Ronnie Collins said earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1290)|
| 0:21:37| long before I even considered running for city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1297)|
| 0:21:41| when I volunteer time for my neighborhood organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1301)|
| 0:21:45| Jack was always so kind to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1305)|
| 0:21:48| He picked up the phone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1308)|
| 0:21:51| he would give me advice about how to lobby| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1311)|
| 0:21:53| for my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1313)|
| 0:21:55| He was always supportive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1315)|
| 0:21:58| Always supportive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| We got along great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1321)|
| 0:22:02| We didn't always agree on things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1322)|
| 0:22:06| Jack for a long time, even though he was at large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| if somebody called him with an issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1328)|
| 0:22:10| they'd go, well, you need to call Rob Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1330)|
| 0:22:12| That's who represents Mountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1332)|
| 0:22:14| So that happened time and time again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1334)|
| 0:22:18| I told the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1338)|
| 0:22:19| well, now Jack can help you out too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1339)|
| 0:22:20| You ought to call Jack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1340)|
| 0:22:21| Well, he said, well, you need to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1341)|
| 0:22:22| he said, they said, Jack said to call you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1342)|
| 0:22:26| So I just filed that in the back of my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| And then when Jack left office and got on MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1348)|
| 0:22:32| people would start calling me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1352)|
| 0:22:33| before something hit the council agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1353)|
| 0:22:34| I said, well, the first person you need to call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1354)|
| 0:22:37| is Jack Sharp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1357)|
| 0:22:38| And about the third or fourth time that that happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| Jack called me at the office just dying and laughing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1361)|
| 0:22:44| because he knew I'd been lying in wait for years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1364)|
| 0:22:47| to get him back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1367)|
| 0:22:48| And he really appreciated that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1368)|
| 0:22:49| But Jack, you know, a great person, a good friend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1369)|
| 0:22:55| I'll miss him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1375)|
| 0:22:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1377)|
| 0:23:00| Council Member Thomas, and then Testerman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1380)|
| 0:23:02| and then McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1382)|
| 0:23:04| Yes, I think what we're hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1384)|
| 0:23:05| this is just an example of the kind of broad sweep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1385)|
| 0:23:09| that Jack had influenced people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1389)|
| 0:23:12| for many years across the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1392)|
| 0:23:15| Many, many years ago, he gave me gentlemanly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1395)|
| 0:23:19| kindly advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1399)|
| 0:23:20| And in later years, he was a regular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1400)|
| 0:23:23| at the North Mounts Business and Professional Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1403)|
| 0:23:27| And just always presented a good example for people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1407)|
| 0:23:32| as far as how to present themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1412)|
| 0:23:35| but also had a tremendous wit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1415)|
| 0:23:40| I think he'll be missed for all of his other attributes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1420)|
| 0:23:44| but the wit, something that he would have had great timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1424)|
| 0:23:49| Sometimes needed a little levity when Jack would come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1429)|
| 0:23:54| and make everybody appreciate him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1434)|

| 0:24:11| I'm not sure that there's much more that I can say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1451)|
| 0:24:15| Although Jack was in and around my life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1455)|
| 0:24:18| for the majority of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| and just really want to extend my thoughts to the family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1460)|
| 0:24:25| I too would call him and ask for guidance and advice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1465)|
| 0:24:30| and he would just say, just do your thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1470)|
| 0:24:33| And just special man, special family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1473)|

| 0:24:43| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1483)|
| 0:24:44| I just wanna say that I didn't have to seek out his advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1484)|
| 0:24:47| In 2017, when I was running for office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1487)|
| 0:24:49| and had 12 other people running against me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1489)|
| 0:24:52| I saw him at a meeting and he gave me advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1492)|
| 0:24:56| And one of the things that I will never forget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| is that he said, you will do great things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1498)|
| 0:25:00| Always be true to yourself and stand your ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1500)|
| 0:25:03| And that resonated with me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1503)|
| 0:25:04| because as everyone shares fond memories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1504)|
| 0:25:07| we know that he served during a time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1507)|
| 0:25:09| when there was a lot of turbulence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1509)|
| 0:25:11| and a lot of change that was going on in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| And he was always a very fair person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1513)|
| 0:25:16| in how he presented policy and made decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1516)|
| 0:25:20| And so I so appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1520)|
| 0:25:21| And all of his kind words every time you see him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1521)|
| 0:25:24| he always had something encouraging to say to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1524)|
| 0:25:25| So to Ms. Sharp and his family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| thank you for sharing him with our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1527)|
| 0:25:30| He did great things and leaves a wonderful legacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1530)|
| 0:25:33| God bless you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1535)|

| 0:28:49| that we choose to invest the money on the back end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1729)|

| 0:28:59| have been able to create safe outdoor spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1739)|

| 0:29:40| they now have a place to take them to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| And it's not trying to force folks into shelters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1782)|
| 0:29:45| that don't work for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1785)|
| 0:29:47| but it's providing an outdoor space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1787)|
| 0:29:50| that has security, that's organized, that's clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1790)|
| 0:29:55| And we can do that with $400,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1795)|
| 0:29:58| We can at least start with $400,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1798)|
| 0:30:02| So I just, I wanted to raise that as an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1802)|
| 0:30:04| I don't plan to vote against this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| but I want to continue to challenge us as a city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| to think of how we can invest this money on the front end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1808)|
| 0:30:12| so that we don't have to do the remediation work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1812)|
| 0:30:15| on the back end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| Thank you, Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1817)|
| 0:30:19| I just would like to say that we do invest a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1819)|
| 0:30:21| on the front end, including showers and laundry services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1821)|
| 0:30:24| and the day space and support for our partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1824)|
| 0:30:27| like Volunteer Ministry Center and the McNabb Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1827)|
| 0:30:30| and Knoxville Leadership Foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1830)|
| 0:30:32| and Permanent Supportive Housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1832)|
| 0:30:33| millions and millions of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| And then we also, when there's contamination of creeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1835)|
| 0:30:39| we are required by state law, TDEC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1839)|
| 0:30:42| and other environmental laws to prevent the pollution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1842)|
| 0:30:46| if we can, but to clean it up if it happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1846)|
| 0:30:48| So just wanted to say that we are working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1848)|
| 0:30:50| on both sides of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1850)|
| 0:30:51| and investing in the prevention as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1851)|
| 0:30:54| Well, and to clarify my comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1854)|
| 0:30:57| invest on the front end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1857)|
| 0:30:58| when it comes to the outdoor encampment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| Just moving the encampments, clearing them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1861)|
| 0:31:04| putting up these measures underneath bridges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1864)|
| 0:31:10| is honestly a waste of money for the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1870)|
| 0:31:13| when it could be invested in providing security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1873)|
| 0:31:18| safe, clean spaces in an outdoor setting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1878)|
| 0:31:21| for those who are in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| or who are not able to access the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| So not all of the other investments in affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| but particularly investments in outdoor encampments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1888)|
| 0:31:33| so that folks can move from that space into city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1893)|
| 0:31:37| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1897)|
| 0:31:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1898)|
| 0:31:40| That's something that I think is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1900)|
| 0:31:42| And it's also something that I've been talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1902)|
| 0:31:44| to a lot of nonprofits because somebody has to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1904)|
| 0:31:49| So there are any nonprofits that are interested in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1909)|
| 0:31:52| please apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1912)|
| 0:31:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1913)|
| 0:31:56| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1916)|
| 0:31:57| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1919)|
| 0:32:00| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1920)|
| 0:32:01| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1921)|
| 0:32:03| 11F is a resolution authorizing the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1923)|
| 0:32:05| to execute an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1925)|
| 0:32:06| with Environmental Remediation Consultants Incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1926)|
| 0:32:09| in an amount not to exceed $200,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1929)|
| 0:32:12| to provide creek cleanup and maintenance services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1932)|
| 0:32:16| for the 2022 Creek Cleanup Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1939)|
| 0:32:20| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1940)|
| 0:32:21| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1941)|
| 0:32:23| I just have to say one more thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1943)|
| 0:32:25| and follow up to the comment that was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| There are groups in the community who want to do this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1947)|
| 0:32:30| The issue is that we need space to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1950)|
| 0:32:33| and we need laws in place that allow it to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1953)|
| 0:32:37| Right now, we do not have laws in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1957)|
| 0:32:39| that allow it to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| and we are struggling to find the space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| but we could actually use some of our city owned land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1963)|
| 0:32:48| to create a pilot project to show that this can work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1968)|
| 0:32:51| because it's worked in other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1971)|
| 0:32:52| So there are groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| and I can share their information with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1974)|
| 0:32:57| I mean, there's architectural designs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1977)|
| 0:32:59| of how these can be laid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| There's developers ready to build the structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| for individuals to live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1984)|
| 0:33:06| We just have to have the political will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1986)|
| 0:33:08| in the city to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1988)|
| 0:33:12| Any further questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=1996)|

| 0:33:27| to the five-year consolidated plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2007)|

| 0:33:33| and authorized the mayor to execute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2013)|
| 0:33:34| any required documents under the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2014)|

| 0:33:41| and emergency solutions grant programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2023)|
| 0:33:44| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2024)|
| 0:33:46| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2026)|
| 0:33:49| Council member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2029)|
| 0:33:52| It's very similar to my previous comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2032)|
| 0:33:55| but in comments that I've made in previous years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2035)|
| 0:33:58| but I just continue to be concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| with how we're allocating these resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2040)|
| 0:34:03| I actually have some questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2043)|
| 0:34:05| about the owner-occupied funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2045)|
| 0:34:08| And if you can help me understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2048)|
| 0:34:11| why the money from last year was unspent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2051)|
| 0:34:14| and if there are already projects identified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| for that kind of funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2057)|
| 0:34:19| Linda Rust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| Good evening, council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2061)|
| 0:34:21| Linda Rust, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2061)|
| 0:34:25| Yes, councilman Parker, appreciate your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2065)|
| 0:34:27| And a lot of those funds are actually already committed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2067)|
| 0:34:30| because construction projects don't run along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2070)|
| 0:34:33| a normal calendar year or program year timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2073)|
| 0:34:38| We can have applications that are in various stages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2078)|
| 0:34:41| of being approved and trying to get contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2081)|
| 0:34:45| to do the work, relocating owner-occupied homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2085)|
| 0:34:50| from their homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| So it's not something that happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2092)|
| 0:34:55| in a particularly organized way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2095)|
| 0:35:00| in the sense that we can predict it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2100)|
| 0:35:01| especially given some of the construction challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2101)|
| 0:35:05| we have right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2105)|
| 0:35:06| So a good portion of those funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2106)|
| 0:35:08| are actually already in progress of being committed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2108)|
| 0:35:12| Okay, because when we spoke last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| about the owner-occupied rehabilitation program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2115)|
| 0:35:18| there were no houses identified yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| There were no one on the waiting list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2120)|
| 0:35:23| but that program got a large chunk of funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2123)|
| 0:35:28| especially in comparison to those experiencing homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2128)|
| 0:35:31| And I see that trend again, where, for instance, ESG dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2131)|
| 0:35:36| I don't believe there was any money left over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| from the emergency solutions grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| that goes towards homeless services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| but a significant amount of money left over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| for the owner-occupied rehabilitation program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2144)|
| 0:35:49| And if we have already identified those projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| and they're moving forward, that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2151)|
| 0:35:54| But if we are going to experience another year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2154)|
| 0:35:57| of unspent funds, just as we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2157)|
| 0:36:00| with the non-congregate shelter funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2160)|
| 0:36:06| then we need to shift that funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| to where there is the most need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2168)|
| 0:36:10| and those dollars are being spent quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2170)|
| 0:36:16| Because it's just sitting there while folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2176)|
| 0:36:19| are hearing about so much federal assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2179)|
| 0:36:22| flowing into the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2182)|
| 0:36:23| but not seeing any results in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2183)|
| 0:36:26| And that's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2186)|
| 0:36:29| One other thing that I've read through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2189)|
| 0:36:35| to get a better understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2195)|
| 0:36:36| of what the approved uses of the funding would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2196)|
| 0:36:40| I found one approved use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| which is the provision of assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| to private for-profit entities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2205)|
| 0:36:49| when assistance appropriate to carry out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| an economic development project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2211)|
| 0:36:54| shall minimize displacement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| of existing businesses and jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| And if that ain't what's happening right now in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2219)|
| 0:37:04| I've heard so many community members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2224)|
| 0:37:06| ask for this type of assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2226)|
| 0:37:07| Local business owners were concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2227)|
| 0:37:10| about the infrastructure investments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2230)|
| 0:37:16| that the cities are making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2236)|
| 0:37:17| and how outside businesses are being attracted to the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2237)|
| 0:37:22| but they're worried about being displaced themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2242)|
| 0:37:25| And this is another set of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2245)|
| 0:37:31| that could be used to help prevent any displacement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2251)|
| 0:37:35| of our current businesses in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| as a lot of economic development happens in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2257)|
| 0:37:44| And so I wanted to highlight that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2264)|
| 0:37:46| because we keep talking about Burlington,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2266)|
| 0:37:47| we keep talking about different programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2267)|
| 0:37:50| that can help address the 42% black poverty rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2272)|
| 0:37:53| help address the lack of black business ownership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2273)|
| 0:37:56| in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| And part of that has to be preserving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2278)|
| 0:38:02| or preventing the displacement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2282)|
| 0:38:05| of a lot of our black-owned businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2285)|
| 0:38:06| and just a lot of our local businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| and neighborhoods that are experiencing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| a lot of development currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| So I just wanted to highlight that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2293)|
| 0:38:17| for this discussion that we have resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2297)|
| 0:38:22| that we can use to prevent displacement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2302)|
| 0:38:26| We have resources that we can use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2306)|
| 0:38:30| to better support those experiencing homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2310)|
| 0:38:33| in our society, in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2313)|
| 0:38:34| And I continue to be concerned about the level of funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2314)|
| 0:38:39| I mean, it's like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| I don't know if you remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2321)|
| 0:38:42| but there's something like 3 million to 300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2322)|
| 0:38:47| I mean, it's such a wide difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2327)|
| 0:38:49| between how much money is going to owner-occupied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2329)|
| 0:38:52| and how much money is going to homeless-occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2332)|
| 0:38:58| So I'm not able to support this annual action plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2338)|
| 0:39:04| And I just wanna encourage the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2344)|
| 0:39:05| that we've got to incorporate new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2345)|
| 0:39:08| we can't keep doing the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| We gotta do something new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2350)|
| 0:39:12| To address new needs in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2352)|
| 0:39:14| to address a growing population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2354)|
| 0:39:17| of people experiencing homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| And what I, and also bring in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2359)|
| 0:39:25| those grassroots service providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2365)|
| 0:39:29| I continue to meet, talk with, work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2369)|
| 0:39:34| grassroots service providers who are providing services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2374)|
| 0:39:39| to people experiencing homelessness in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2379)|
| 0:39:42| including housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2382)|
| 0:39:43| Who have major agencies referring people to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2383)|
| 0:39:49| for housing, people from the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2389)|
| 0:39:53| referring them for housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| And the city won't even acknowledge them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| It doesn't make any sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| And these folks don't even know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| that there's a mayor's round table on homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| We've gotta bring in all of these groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2404)|
| 0:40:07| We can't just work with the large agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2407)|
| 0:40:10| because the need is so great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| We have folks who are stepping it up in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2412)|
| 0:40:17| and they need our support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2417)|
| 0:40:20| They need our support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| And there's money coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| that the agencies who've gotten the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2424)|
| 0:40:27| can't figure out what to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2427)|
| 0:40:30| I mean, that's in the report, y'all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2430)|
| 0:40:32| The money's been allocated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2432)|
| 0:40:35| but we have agencies holding this money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2435)|
| 0:40:37| don't know what to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2437)|
| 0:40:39| Meanwhile, we got small grassroots groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2439)|
| 0:40:42| where folks are spending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2442)|
| 0:40:43| their own personal disability checks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2443)|
| 0:40:46| to buy food for other people because they care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2446)|
| 0:40:50| And these large agencies just hold money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2450)|
| 0:40:52| don't know what to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| I mean, y'all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2454)|
| 0:40:57| So no, we can do better and we've gotta do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2457)|
| 0:41:01| So no, no, I don't support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2461)|
| 0:41:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2465)|
| 0:41:06| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2466)|
| 0:41:07| Yeah, I just was gonna ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2467)|
| 0:41:10| like what are the restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2470)|
| 0:41:11| that shape how the money is used in the action plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2471)|
| 0:41:17| Ms. Russ?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2477)|
| 0:41:18| Yes, we do a five-year consolidated plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2478)|
| 0:41:21| and we last did that in 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2481)|
| 0:41:23| Which is what we're voting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| This is the action plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2485)|
| 0:41:26| So there's a five-year strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2486)|
| 0:41:29| We did, gosh, probably five months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2489)|
| 0:41:31| of community input for that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2491)|
| 0:41:35| And then each year we are told by HUD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2495)|
| 0:41:38| what our allocation is gonna be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2498)|
| 0:41:40| for our community development block grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2500)|
| 0:41:42| home investment partnership grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| and emergency solutions grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| So we know on a yearly basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| how much funding we're gonna get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| We do an application process based on the priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2510)|
| 0:41:53| that came out of the five-year strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2513)|
| 0:41:56| And also we do public meetings and consultation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2516)|
| 0:41:59| We did that in January, February, and April of this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2519)|
| 0:42:04| as well as a 30-day public comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2524)|
| 0:42:06| So we take all of that feedback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2526)|
| 0:42:08| as well as facts and data and information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2528)|
| 0:42:12| about what the needs are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| We have our 311, our 211 program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| that provides us data on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2536)|
| 0:42:19| what the needs that people have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| I also wanna speak to Councilwoman Parker's questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2541)|
| 0:42:27| and concerns about some of the funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| that are not part of the annual action plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2549)|
| 0:42:32| but these are those Supplemental CARES Act funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2552)|
| 0:42:35| that we still continue to reallocate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| And we will be coming back to you within about six weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2557)|
| 0:42:41| to talk with you about reallocating some of those funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2561)|
| 0:42:44| to meet the needs that you're speaking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2564)|
| 0:42:45| Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| But the action plan really has to do with the allocations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2567)|
| 0:42:51| and the funding that we received this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2571)|
| 0:42:54| and matching those to the community needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2574)|
| 0:43:00| that we've heard through our consultation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2580)|
| 0:43:01| and our public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2581)|
| 0:43:03| And we spoke with this body at the beginning of May| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2583)|
| 0:43:07| to hear some of your concerns as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2587)|
| 0:43:10| Can I answer it, Councilwoman Robertson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2590)|
| 0:43:13| I'll let my colleague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| Councilmember Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2595)|
| 0:43:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2596)|
| 0:43:17| Mr. Rust, I think what I'd like a little clearer definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2597)|
| 0:43:22| on what I think I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2602)|
| 0:43:24| and you correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2604)|
| 0:43:27| HUD sends us money in certain tranches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| and they tell us what that money is allowed to be used for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2610)|
| 0:43:34| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2614)|
| 0:43:35| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2615)|
| 0:43:36| So if there's leftover money in one of those tranches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2616)|
| 0:43:39| we cannot just decide to use it another way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2619)|
| 0:43:43| Is that why oftentimes we see like the rollover money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2623)|
| 0:43:47| because it's committed, HUD will let us roll over the funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2627)|
| 0:43:51| We cannot just reallocate them to a different use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2631)|
| 0:43:55| since they are federal funds, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2635)|
| 0:43:58| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2638)|
| 0:43:58| Each of the three programs that we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2638)|
| 0:44:01| do have requirements and regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2641)|
| 0:44:04| for how those funds can be spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| And if we can't make decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| really outside of those regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2648)|
| 0:44:12| but we can decide if there's funding that does get left over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2652)|
| 0:44:16| which we have every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2656)|
| 0:44:18| there may be funding that's left over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2658)|
| 0:44:20| and we can talk with the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| and go through a substantial amendment process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2662)|
| 0:44:25| And that's what we'll be doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2665)|
| 0:44:26| with some of our community development block grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2666)|
| 0:44:28| CV or CARES Act funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2668)|
| 0:44:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| Yeah, I just wanna clarify with Ms. Russ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| from the dinner meeting that we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| the anticipation for this year or the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| is to have less dollars than X, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2684)|
| 0:44:48| Or allotment is going to decrease?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2688)|
| 0:44:51| Yes and no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2691)|
| 0:44:52| We anticipated a 5% decrease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2692)|
| 0:44:55| in our community development block grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| but it was actually a 6.32% decrease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2697)|
| 0:45:01| So a little bit more than we had estimated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| And then in our home grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| we estimated that that would stay level funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| to the current year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2707)|
| 0:45:09| and we received a 6.65% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2709)|
| 0:45:13| And the home grant by its name can only be spent on housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2713)|
| 0:45:18| And then our emergency solutions grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2718)|
| 0:45:20| we expected a 1% increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2720)|
| 0:45:24| and we got a 1.5% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2724)|
| 0:45:27| But the total federal dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2727)|
| 0:45:28| that we are given specifically for homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2728)|
| 0:45:34| is about 152,500 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2734)|
| 0:45:38| In fact, city council and the mayor through the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2738)|
| 0:45:42| you approve more than that in local homeless general funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2742)|
| 0:45:47| that help to match that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2747)|
| 0:45:48| but you actually provide more funding than that locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2748)|
| 0:45:52| But we are able to use a certain percentage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2752)|
| 0:45:55| of our CDBG funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| a greater percentage of our Supplemental Cares Act funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2757)|
| 0:46:02| which again, we'll be bringing that substantial amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2762)|
| 0:46:05| back to you in a few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| But we're able to use that on public services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2767)|
| 0:46:10| which can include homeless services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2770)|
| 0:46:12| So the funding that you're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2772)|
| 0:46:13| what we're voting on this action plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2773)|
| 0:46:15| is a limit to how much can be used for emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2775)|
| 0:46:19| That's what you just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| Yes, we have some of our CDBG funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| a small amount that we have to be used for public services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2783)|
| 0:46:28| that address homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2788)|
| 0:46:29| But most and everything of our ESG funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2789)|
| 0:46:33| are homeless general funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| And then, but the biggest amount that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2795)|
| 0:46:38| is that Cares Act supplemental funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2798)|
| 0:46:41| Okay, and the funds that you're gonna be coming back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| with an amendment for that are unspent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2803)|
| 0:46:47| what are the reasons why it's unspent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2807)|
| 0:46:50| A lot of it was the capacity issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2810)|
| 0:46:53| with our nonprofit organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2813)|
| 0:46:54| They had a hard time getting programs off the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2814)|
| 0:46:58| We heard a lot of the same kind of problems that we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2818)|
| 0:47:02| We see in multiple industries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2822)|
| 0:47:04| So I think it was they had a difficult time hiring staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2824)|
| 0:47:09| You can't just hire any staff to do these programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2829)|
| 0:47:13| You need social workers who are skilled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2833)|
| 0:47:15| And so that is one of the things we heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| And in some places we were able to switch funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2837)|
| 0:47:20| where it made more sense to use funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2840)|
| 0:47:23| from one source versus another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2843)|
| 0:47:26| So we have tried to, we've been to you multiple times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2846)|
| 0:47:30| doing amendments for these Cares Act funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2850)|
| 0:47:32| And it's because we really tried to be responsive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| to the community need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2854)|
| 0:47:36| And we give the agency the support that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2856)|
| 0:47:39| so that they can get these funds off the ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2859)|
| 0:47:42| get these programs running,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2862)|
| 0:47:44| but it doesn't always work out the way that they plan to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2864)|
| 0:47:47| So rather than let them struggle for too long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2867)|
| 0:47:51| we can take some of those funds back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2871)|
| 0:47:53| we can take all of the funds back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2873)|
| 0:47:54| and then give them to the programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2874)|
| 0:47:56| that actually are spending the funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| quickly and efficiently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2878)|
| 0:48:01| I'll follow up with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2881)|
| 0:48:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2884)|
| 0:48:05| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2887)|
| 0:48:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2888)|

| 0:48:41| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2921)|
| 0:48:43| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=2923)|

| 0:50:24| Just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3024)|
| 0:50:26| Was this asked for by Chief Noel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3026)|
| 0:50:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3032)|
| 0:50:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3032)|
| 0:50:33| I just kind of wanted that out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3033)|
| 0:50:35| because it looked like they had worked in New Orleans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3035)|
| 0:50:38| so I assume that's someone he's familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3038)|
| 0:50:42| Was this a grant that was available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3042)|
| 0:50:45| at the East Tennessee Foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3045)|
| 0:50:47| or did someone, some benevolent donor-advised fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3047)|
| 0:50:52| agree to fund this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3052)|
| 0:50:54| It's a donor-advised fund that knew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3054)|
| 0:50:56| that it's supportive of our police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3056)|
| 0:50:59| and knew that Chief Noel wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3059)|
| 0:51:02| to have this outside assessment done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3062)|
| 0:51:03| before he got started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3063)|
| 0:51:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3065)|
| 0:51:05| I mean, I just want that clarified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3065)|
| 0:51:06| because the East Tennessee Foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3066)|
| 0:51:08| is not typically in the habit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3068)|
| 0:51:10| of putting out grant requests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3070)|
| 0:51:12| for police funding things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3072)|
| 0:51:14| so I assumed it was a donor-advised fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3074)|
| 0:51:16| and I know we can't know who that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3076)|
| 0:51:18| but Mr. McLemore, will you tell that donor thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3078)|
| 0:51:22| Mr. McLemore, did you want to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3082)|
| 0:51:26| You're with the East Tennessee Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3086)|
| 0:51:28| Did you want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3088)|
| 0:51:29| I'm with the McLemore East Tennessee Foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3089)|
| 0:51:32| 505 West Summit Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| I'm happy to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3094)|
| 0:51:39| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3099)|
| 0:51:40| Oh, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3100)|
| 0:51:41| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3101)|
| 0:51:42| I have a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3102)|
| 0:51:43| I just have a question about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3103)|
| 0:51:44| the city had done a study six, eight months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3104)|
| 0:51:48| on the culture of the city and it included KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3108)|
| 0:51:55| We had done a study that we monitored it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3115)|
| 0:51:58| and then there was policy coming out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3118)|
| 0:52:02| I'm not, I don't recall any culture study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3122)|
| 0:52:07| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3127)|
| 0:52:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| I'm just wondering what the similarities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3132)|
| 0:52:14| or the differences are between them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3134)|
| 0:52:16| We tried to research that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3136)|
| 0:52:17| I'm not familiar, off the top of my head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3137)|
| 0:52:19| I don't recall what the HR department did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| as a cultural study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3141)|
| 0:52:24| It was after we passed the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3144)|
| 0:52:26| about investigating claims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3146)|
| 0:52:31| Okay, I think that's still in process, David?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3151)|
| 0:52:34| It is, it's in process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3154)|
| 0:52:35| The law department, HMTAS, outside legal counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3155)|
| 0:52:39| are still working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| We're very separate from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| Mayor, if you or Mr. Klamrock may talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3163)|
| 0:52:46| the intent of this and what the new chief would like to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3166)|
| 0:52:50| Yeah, this is something Chief Noel and I spoke about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3170)|
| 0:52:53| but it's something that community members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3173)|
| 0:52:55| and council members have been talking about for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3175)|
| 0:52:58| And so I believe that now's the perfect time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3178)|
| 0:53:00| because one thing I know from Dr. Drummond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3180)|
| 0:53:03| and just experience is you don't wanna do a survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3183)|
| 0:53:07| until you're also ready to act on the results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3187)|
| 0:53:09| So now that Chief Noel's gonna be taking office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3189)|
| 0:53:12| in less than two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3192)|
| 0:53:15| you know, we'll hopefully conduct some of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3195)|
| 0:53:17| you know, get started on this cultural assessment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3197)|
| 0:53:20| before he starts and finish up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3200)|
| 0:53:22| within the first few weeks of his time as our chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3202)|
| 0:53:27| And then he can take those results| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| and have that as a baseline for working towards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3209)|
| 0:53:33| you know, constant improvement, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3213)|
| 0:53:35| I think this is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3215)|
| 0:53:36| It's a great way to start a relationship with Chief Noel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3216)|
| 0:53:39| I was just trying to figure out where the overlap was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3219)|
| 0:53:42| Yeah, that's, there's not overlapped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| That one is not really complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3224)|
| 0:53:48| Vice Mayor, I mean, Council Member McKenzie, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3228)|
| 0:53:51| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3231)|
| 0:53:51| And just to speak to Council Member Singh's comments as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3231)|
| 0:53:56| I do know that there was an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3236)|
| 0:53:58| for people to be able to leave comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| and that may be what you were referring to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3240)|
| 0:54:03| but I think this is gonna be a more in-depth survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3243)|
| 0:54:06| I think that it will be anonymous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3246)|
| 0:54:09| The feedback will be anonymous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3249)|
| 0:54:11| And so it will give employees of KPD more confidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3251)|
| 0:54:15| in being able to speak freely about the culture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3255)|
| 0:54:17| and what their experiences have been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3257)|
| 0:54:18| So I too am very excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3258)|
| 0:54:21| I'm very excited about the organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3261)|
| 0:54:23| that we've chosen as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3263)|
| 0:54:25| and look forward to getting this up and running| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3265)|
| 0:54:28| and the results coming back to Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3268)|
| 0:54:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3270)|
| 0:54:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3272)|
| 0:54:33| Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3273)|
| 0:54:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3274)|
| 0:54:36| First of all, I appreciate the Senesee Foundation's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3276)|
| 0:54:38| willingness to fund this culture assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3278)|
| 0:54:43| I'm struggling a little bit on the fact that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3283)|
| 0:54:47| I guess I personally feel like it's a little bit premature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3287)|
| 0:54:51| just coming in as a new leader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3291)|
| 0:54:53| I mean, the contract actually starts tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3293)|
| 0:54:56| two weeks before he even arrives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3296)|
| 0:54:59| or is sworn in, I should say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3299)|
| 0:55:00| But I don't know, I guess as a new leader,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3300)|
| 0:55:05| as chief of police or with any organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3305)|
| 0:55:08| to really be able to have the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3308)|
| 0:55:12| to first get to know your team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3312)|
| 0:55:15| There's going to be somebody who will be responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3315)|
| 0:55:20| for the culture of the organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| And there will be a culture shift| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3322)|
| 0:55:24| as comes with any change of that magnitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3324)|
| 0:55:28| And to establish those channels of communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3328)|
| 0:55:32| And I guess for me a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3332)|
| 0:55:35| an employee survey, an assessment coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3335)|
| 0:55:40| just in my experience has the potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3340)|
| 0:55:42| to work against you as you're establishing trust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3342)|
| 0:55:48| out of the gate a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3348)|
| 0:55:50| Also struggle just looking through this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3350)|
| 0:55:54| I see a lot of duplication of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3354)|
| 0:55:57| So if somebody wants to explain to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3357)|
| 0:56:00| I mean, you've got recruiting, hiring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3360)|
| 0:56:01| promotion, retention practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3361)|
| 0:56:03| I mean, we have a director of HR with a doctorate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3363)|
| 0:56:06| I think he's fully capable of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3366)|
| 0:56:08| We've got a director, a community safety director as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3368)|
| 0:56:14| And I just feel like I just need some clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3374)|
| 0:56:19| that was just brought up that I feel like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3379)|
| 0:56:21| again, there's some duplication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3381)|
| 0:56:24| police safety and wellness programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3384)|
| 0:56:27| My other question, again, you've got the strategic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3387)|
| 0:56:31| well, and this is further down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3391)|
| 0:56:33| but a proposed strategic plan focusing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3393)|
| 0:56:36| on building partnerships and addressing crime in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3396)|
| 0:56:39| And I guess my thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3399)|
| 0:56:40| that would be under the purview of Director Middlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3400)|
| 0:56:46| I just need, I would like some clarification around this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3406)|
| 0:56:48| And the full proposal is $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3408)|
| 0:56:51| I know that this is phase one of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3411)|
| 0:56:53| I would like to know what's the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3413)|
| 0:56:56| I mean, from a funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3416)|
| 0:57:00| is the intention to do the entire proposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3420)|
| 0:57:03| I'm struggling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3423)|
| 0:57:05| Well, I'm gonna let Mr. Swanson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3425)|
| 0:57:06| direct the legal contractual questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3426)|
| 0:57:09| and then I'll answer the broader ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3429)|
| 0:57:11| Yeah, with respect to the whole plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3431)|
| 0:57:15| no, we're not entering into that agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3435)|
| 0:57:17| This is just for that initial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3437)|
| 0:57:21| police department climate assessment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3441)|
| 0:57:24| which is simply a tool that is to be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3444)|
| 0:57:26| by the new leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3446)|
| 0:57:27| It's a tool that would be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3447)|
| 0:57:28| by the current leadership as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3448)|
| 0:57:31| to the extent that they're able to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3451)|
| 0:57:34| But the real difference here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3454)|
| 0:57:38| is that this is really focused on policing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3458)|
| 0:57:41| Policing is a very different aspect of government service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3461)|
| 0:57:47| And it has a lot of moving parts to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3467)|
| 0:57:51| And these are folks who are expert in those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3471)|
| 0:57:56| We have folks who are expert in the area of human relations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3476)|
| 0:57:59| We have experts in the area of general employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3479)|
| 0:58:03| For this type of particular study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3483)|
| 0:58:06| it really requires the expertise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3486)|
| 0:58:09| not just of human relations, but of policing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3489)|
| 0:58:13| We could not do, we cannot effectively do a study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3493)|
| 0:58:16| of the climate of the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3496)|
| 0:58:18| without using persons who are very cognizant of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3498)|
| 0:58:25| and have educated themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3505)|
| 0:58:27| about the expertise of policing itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3507)|
| 0:58:31| And this company has that expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3511)|
| 0:58:34| If you look at the qualifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3514)|
| 0:58:35| of the folks who would be doing the work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3515)|
| 0:58:38| you will find that there are very, very qualified folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3518)|
| 0:58:42| who have developed this over a significant period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3522)|
| 0:58:45| And they've been in for a number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3525)|
| 0:58:47| of other police organizations across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3527)|
| 0:58:50| And they've been successfully used for that purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3530)|
| 0:58:55| Council Member Tesseran, I would just add,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3535)|
| 0:58:57| just to clarify, the contract you're voting on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3537)|
| 0:59:00| well, this item is to accept a grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3540)|
| 0:59:05| from the East Tennessee Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3545)|
| 0:59:07| But the next item is just for the 40,000 climate assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3547)|
| 0:59:12| Once Chief Noel has an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3552)|
| 0:59:13| to take over the reins and start getting some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3553)|
| 0:59:16| of the results of that climate assessment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3556)|
| 0:59:19| then we'll decide whether there's a need for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3559)|
| 0:59:22| or interest in pursuing the strategic planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3562)|
| 0:59:26| and policy review and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3566)|
| 0:59:27| And I would just add that issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3567)|
| 0:59:33| at the police department with retention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| and recruitment have been an acute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3575)|
| 0:59:38| I would say, crisis situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3578)|
| 0:59:39| And so understanding the culture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3579)|
| 0:59:42| and making sure that we make it a place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3582)|
| 0:59:44| that people want to join and stay in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3584)|
| 0:59:47| and have top quality officers doing 21st century policing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3587)|
| 0:59:53| That happens to be the name that 21CP comes from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3593)|
| 0:59:57| That's a paramount importance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3597)|
| 0:59:59| And I'm also very grateful that I'm not coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3599)|
| 1:00:02| to council to ask for more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3602)|
| 1:00:03| We have these donors who are willing to fund this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3603)|
| 1:00:07| because they also understand that public safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3607)|
| 1:00:09| is essential to the health and welfare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3609)|
| 1:00:12| of our whole community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3612)|
| 1:00:13| And I do think that the policing situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3613)|
| 1:00:16| and circumstances are a unique part of our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3616)|
| 1:00:19| and having a specialized effort to help Chief Noel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3619)|
| 1:00:23| get off on the right foot is essential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3623)|
| 1:00:29| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3629)|
| 1:00:31| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3631)|
| 1:00:32| I just want to add a perspective on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3632)|
| 1:00:34| that I think we have a new chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3634)|
| 1:00:38| Chief Thomas did a great job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3638)|
| 1:00:40| but I think there are plenty of improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3640)|
| 1:00:41| that need to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3641)|
| 1:00:42| I have trouble second guessing the new chief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3642)|
| 1:00:46| on his first ask of kind of objective support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3646)|
| 1:00:50| I think there are variations of leadership style| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3650)|
| 1:00:53| that it seems like he's requesting a third party| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3653)|
| 1:00:57| come alongside him as he evaluates this department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3657)|
| 1:01:00| I think that out of the gate, I plan to support this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3660)|
| 1:01:04| because I think we've got real unique challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3664)|
| 1:01:08| in our police department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3668)|
| 1:01:09| and I think it requires a certain level of expertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3669)|
| 1:01:12| that maybe not everybody has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3672)|
| 1:01:14| With that said, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3674)|
| 1:01:16| I think that funding to implement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3676)|
| 1:01:19| a lot of those recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| I think there's plenty enough police budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3681)|
| 1:01:24| I don't necessarily know that we need to rely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3684)|
| 1:01:26| on third party funding in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3686)|
| 1:01:30| but I think a very narrow objective look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3690)|
| 1:01:35| to come alongside a new chief, I think is healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3695)|
| 1:01:39| But subsequent funding will be under,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3699)|
| 1:01:42| I think, different scrutiny, but that's my perspective on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3702)|
| 1:01:46| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3706)|
| 1:01:47| I mean, I'm sorry, Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3707)|
| 1:01:49| I'm so sorry, Vice Mayor Rivera, I'm just tired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3709)|
| 1:01:52| No worries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3712)|
| 1:01:53| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3713)|
| 1:01:54| And I just want to just follow up on some of the comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3714)|
| 1:01:57| by a Council Member Testerman in pointing out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3717)|
| 1:02:00| that we have the Office of Community Safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3720)|
| 1:02:04| We have a director in that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3724)|
| 1:02:05| We now have an HR department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3725)|
| 1:02:06| which are all steps in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3726)|
| 1:02:08| I think we all would be remiss if we did not acknowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3728)|
| 1:02:11| that we have had culture issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3731)|
| 1:02:13| at the KPD Council Police Department for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3733)|
| 1:02:17| And those started bubbling up here in the last two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3737)|
| 1:02:20| And I'm sorry, we cannot ignore those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3740)|
| 1:02:22| We're moving in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3742)|
| 1:02:24| I think with this new chief and following through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3744)|
| 1:02:26| I have always been an advocate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3746)|
| 1:02:27| and asked for an anonymous survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3747)|
| 1:02:30| so we can get to the root of how do employees at KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3750)|
| 1:02:34| really feel about the work environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3754)|
| 1:02:36| and the people that they're working for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3756)|
| 1:02:37| and the leadership there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3757)|
| 1:02:38| And again, this is a step in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3758)|
| 1:02:41| But again, it may not be the only step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3761)|
| 1:02:42| There may be some results that come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3762)|
| 1:02:44| that will say that we need to do some things differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3764)|
| 1:02:47| Chief Noel will come to us with some things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3767)|
| 1:02:50| and hopefully some very innovative ideas that he will have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3770)|
| 1:02:54| about how we can create a culture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3774)|
| 1:02:55| that is inclusive of all people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3775)|
| 1:02:58| to feel welcomed to work at KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3778)|
| 1:03:01| and to be able to voice their concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3781)|
| 1:03:02| and know that they're going to be heard and addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3782)|
| 1:03:04| And so again, I just wanted to mention that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3784)|
| 1:03:07| because I don't want us to sit around this table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3787)|
| 1:03:09| and think that everything's wonderful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3789)|
| 1:03:12| because we've made a few steps in progress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3792)|
| 1:03:15| in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3795)|
| 1:03:15| I do think we're moving in the right direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3795)|
| 1:03:17| but we do have to address these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3797)|
| 1:03:19| And this is one way of being able to get some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3799)|
| 1:03:22| hopefully truthful information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3802)|
| 1:03:24| and employees will feel good about sharing this information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3804)|
| 1:03:28| and seeing that we as a city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3808)|
| 1:03:29| and the mayor's administration is very serious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3809)|
| 1:03:32| about improving the working conditions at KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3812)|
| 1:03:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3815)|
| 1:03:36| And I'll just add that this in no way supplants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3816)|
| 1:03:38| the chief's intentions to get to know the department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3818)|
| 1:03:41| as best he can, as fast as he can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3821)|
| 1:03:44| This is just another tool for him to do so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3824)|
| 1:03:46| in an effective way and an objective way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3826)|
| 1:03:49| with the help of outside consultants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3829)|
| 1:03:50| who have done this in a very effective manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3830)|
| 1:03:54| throughout for departments across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3834)|
| 1:03:56| So it's gonna be a both and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3836)|
| 1:03:58| and it's gonna help him do his job even better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3838)|
| 1:04:03| and support him in understanding the strengths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3843)|
| 1:04:05| and opportunities that we have to continue to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3845)|
| 1:04:09| you know, make our department strong as it can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3849)|
| 1:04:11| Ms. Parker, and then back to Ms. Testimony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3851)|
| 1:04:17| I'm happy to see some effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3857)|
| 1:04:20| but as I read through the proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3860)|
| 1:04:24| I do think it's lacking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3864)|
| 1:04:28| I'm reading this as organizational culture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3868)|
| 1:04:33| processes, those types of things, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3873)|
| 1:04:37| But what we've been dealing with are employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3877)|
| 1:04:41| who are dealing with harassment and discrimination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3881)|
| 1:04:47| And so at minimum, we need this contractor to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3887)|
| 1:04:53| when looking at policies and practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3893)|
| 1:04:55| anti-harassment has to be on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3895)|
| 1:04:59| And I also see it, this project trying to kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3899)|
| 1:05:07| eventually address multiple issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3907)|
| 1:05:12| I see a lot of focus on internal culture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3912)|
| 1:05:16| but then a step in the process are these focus groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3916)|
| 1:05:21| community-based focus groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3921)|
| 1:05:24| And so I'm trying to understand if the focus of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3924)|
| 1:05:29| consultant will be on internal policies and practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3929)|
| 1:05:34| what will be that role of community-based organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3934)|
| 1:05:38| in this process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3938)|
| 1:05:42| My understanding is this is a climate assessment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3942)|
| 1:05:44| for the internal department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3944)|
| 1:05:46| And going forward, I mean, Chief Tom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3946)|
| 1:05:48| I mean, Chief Noel is very committed to communicating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3948)|
| 1:05:53| and building trust and where needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3953)|
| 1:05:55| restoring trust in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3955)|
| 1:05:57| But this is internal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3957)|
| 1:05:58| This is about the climate of KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3958)|
| 1:06:00| And that would be my concern is trying to do too much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3960)|
| 1:06:05| within this $40,000 contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3965)|
| 1:06:07| Let's do something well and move on to the next thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3967)|
| 1:06:10| and do it well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3970)|
| 1:06:12| But I just want to emphasize similar to the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3972)|
| 1:06:17| the schools are doing in terms of addressing school climate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3977)|
| 1:06:23| and making it a more culturally responsive environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3983)|
| 1:06:29| We have to think of the culture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3989)|
| 1:06:31| just not in terms of organizational processes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3991)|
| 1:06:35| but the people within that organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3995)|
| 1:06:37| and their experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3997)|
| 1:06:39| And I wasn't seeing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=3999)|
| 1:06:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4002)|
| 1:06:43| Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4003)|
| 1:06:46| So I guess just going back to the assessment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4006)|
| 1:06:52| and sort of what's outlined in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4012)|
| 1:06:54| and I get the internal stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4014)|
| 1:06:56| There seems to be a lot of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4016)|
| 1:06:58| I guess I'll just go back during the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4018)|
| 1:07:01| of seeking community input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4021)|
| 1:07:04| as the search for the chief started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4024)|
| 1:07:10| just trying to understand again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4030)|
| 1:07:11| from a community engagement standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4031)|
| 1:07:15| what would be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4035)|
| 1:07:16| I would also like to hear from Interim Chief Fortner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4036)|
| 1:07:19| kind of on your thoughts as he's presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4039)|
| 1:07:25| Yeah, so he wants to do this climate study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4045)|
| 1:07:28| to see where the department is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4048)|
| 1:07:30| and I think it's a good idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4050)|
| 1:07:32| because as Council Member McKimpy said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4052)|
| 1:07:36| we need some input from people who are anonymous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4056)|
| 1:07:40| to give us a true feeling of the new chief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4060)|
| 1:07:44| and see where he's at as far as personnel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4064)|
| 1:07:48| what's going good and what's not going good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4068)|
| 1:07:50| We need to improve on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4070)|
| 1:07:54| Again, thanks to East Tennessee Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4074)|
| 1:08:01| Seeing no further questions or discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4081)|
| 1:08:03| all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4083)|
| 1:08:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4084)|
| 1:08:05| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4085)|
| 1:08:06| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4086)|
| 1:08:08| Next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4088)|
| 1:08:09| 11L is a resolution authorizing the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4089)|
| 1:08:11| to execute a professional services agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4091)|
| 1:08:13| with 21 CP Solutions for performance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4093)|
| 1:08:17| of a climate assessment of the Knoxville Police Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4097)|
| 1:08:19| for an amount not to exceed $40,250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4099)|
| 1:08:22| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4102)|

| 1:10:24| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4224)|
| 1:10:25| There's a lot of good capital projects in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4225)|
| 1:10:28| and I plan to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4228)|
| 1:10:32| I do think that there's a significant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4232)|
| 1:10:35| not, I guess, significant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4235)|
| 1:10:36| but there needs to be slight adjustment in future budgets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4236)|
| 1:10:40| I think, towards neighborhood infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4240)|
| 1:10:43| particularly sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4243)|
| 1:10:44| I know sidewalks are expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4244)|
| 1:10:46| We want to move the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4246)|
| 1:10:47| We want to save roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4247)|
| 1:10:48| but I do think there's an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4248)|
| 1:10:53| to turn the dial a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4253)|
| 1:10:54| toward that neighborhood infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4254)|
| 1:10:56| I know there's a lot of wastewater budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4256)|
| 1:10:58| but particularly blighted property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4258)|
| 1:11:02| remediation, sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4262)|
| 1:11:04| and some of those neighborhood kind of infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4264)|
| 1:11:09| projects in the outlying areas of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4269)|
| 1:11:11| are extremely important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4271)|
| 1:11:13| and I think we should shift a little bit more budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4273)|
| 1:11:15| next year to those areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4275)|
| 1:11:16| but nonetheless, I'll support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4276)|
| 1:11:21| Thank you, Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4281)|

| 1:11:25| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4285)|
| 1:11:26| Well, I plan to vote against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4286)|
| 1:11:28| I just wanted to share a few reasons why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4288)|
| 1:11:32| One thing that the community has been calling for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4292)|
| 1:11:41| for quite a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4301)|
| 1:11:42| and it's similar to what Council Member Smith said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4302)|
| 1:11:45| but moving that investment outside of the downtown area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4305)|
| 1:11:49| but we just can't seem to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4309)|
| 1:11:54| and some of the projects that I've brought up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4314)|
| 1:11:56| over the last couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4316)|
| 1:11:57| I'm still looking for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4317)|
| 1:11:59| I still need to talk to finance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4319)|
| 1:12:00| and say these projects are in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4320)|
| 1:12:03| but they haven't started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4323)|
| 1:12:05| I see no improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4325)|
| 1:12:09| and I see the money being prioritized in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4329)|
| 1:12:13| for a certain area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4333)|
| 1:12:14| and we need a more equitable plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4334)|
| 1:12:16| for our capital improvement budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4336)|
| 1:12:20| so I'm not able to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4340)|
| 1:12:22| I do think it misses the mark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4342)|
| 1:12:25| on what our priorities should be this upcoming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4345)|

| 1:13:44| One, because when you guys did recode,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4424)|
| 1:13:47| RN-5 is really designed to be a transitional zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4427)|
| 1:13:51| It's designed for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4431)|
| 1:13:52| This isn't a transitional area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4432)|
| 1:13:55| You have commercial at the red light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4435)|
| 1:13:56| at Dutch Valley and Bruin Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4436)|
| 1:13:58| This is just a few hundred feet up the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4438)|
| 1:14:00| Past that, you get into more of the residential side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4440)|
| 1:14:03| single family duplexes and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4443)|
| 1:14:06| On page three, I even included a little map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4446)|
| 1:14:09| showing some of that transitional area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4449)|
| 1:14:12| Page four actually shows some of the commercial uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4452)|
| 1:14:14| that are in that area, the gas station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4454)|
| 1:14:18| There's pest control agency, a Dollar General store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4458)|
| 1:14:21| Again, these are only a few hundred feet away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4461)|
| 1:14:23| from the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4463)|
| 1:14:26| The second reason is the property's located in an area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4466)|
| 1:14:28| that's already got multifamily in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4468)|
| 1:14:31| It actually borders multifamily, literally, right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4471)|
| 1:14:34| On the page six, it'll show you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4474)|
| 1:14:38| where that bordering property is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4478)|
| 1:14:39| with the multifamily property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4479)|
| 1:14:43| Another one, there's another one 350 feet away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4483)|
| 1:14:45| another one 850 feet away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4485)|
| 1:14:47| and they're sporadically out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4487)|
| 1:14:50| Page seven, again, gives you an idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4490)|
| 1:14:52| of that multifamily that is bordering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4492)|
| 1:14:55| and or very close to the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4495)|
| 1:14:58| Number three reason I think they approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4498)|
| 1:15:00| or recommended approval is because it's within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4500)|
| 1:15:02| walking distance to two public parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4502)|
| 1:15:05| One is literally across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4505)|
| 1:15:07| Another one is just a few,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4507)|
| 1:15:09| less than 2,000 feet away in Sharp Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4509)|
| 1:15:12| Again, included a small map that has that explained on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4512)|
| 1:15:17| Page 10 actually shows some of the amenities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4517)|
| 1:15:20| at the park directly across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4520)|
| 1:15:21| the Kenskip Park pool, the concession stand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4521)|
| 1:15:24| playground, tennis courts, open spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4524)|
| 1:15:26| walking trails, that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4526)|
| 1:15:29| The number four reason I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4529)|
| 1:15:30| that they're recommending approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4530)|
| 1:15:32| is that it's only 450 feet or so away from a CAT bus line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4532)|
| 1:15:36| This allows quick access to any of the city services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4536)|
| 1:15:40| jobs, entertainment, shopping, public amenities as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4540)|
| 1:15:44| Again, have a map showing roughly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4544)|
| 1:15:46| where the CAT bus line runs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4546)|
| 1:15:49| The fifth reason I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4549)|
| 1:15:51| they've recommended approval on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4551)|
| 1:15:53| is that it's not constrained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4553)|
| 1:15:55| by the Hillside and Ridgeside Protection Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4555)|
| 1:15:57| and our plan, pardon me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4557)|
| 1:15:59| In 2011, the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4559)|
| 1:16:01| adopted the Hillside Protection Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4561)|
| 1:16:03| to help protect the natural beauty of our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4563)|
| 1:16:07| In doing so, this encourages good planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4567)|
| 1:16:09| by restricting the density on the steeper parcels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4569)|
| 1:16:14| pardon me, and by default,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4574)|
| 1:16:16| it should encourage density on flatter pieces of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4576)|
| 1:16:20| This parcel is, 100% of this parcel is less than 15% grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4580)|
| 1:16:24| so it doesn't fall under the purview of the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4584)|
| 1:16:26| so it is not in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4586)|
| 1:16:29| The sixth reason I think is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4589)|
| 1:16:31| because of the demand for housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4591)|
| 1:16:33| especially affordable housing in the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4593)|
| 1:16:36| is exceeding supply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4596)|
| 1:16:39| We looked up the 2022 State of Housing Report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4599)|
| 1:16:42| by the Knoxville Area Association of Realtors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4602)|
| 1:16:45| and it is showing that Knoxville and Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4605)|
| 1:16:47| currently has 17,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4607)|
| 1:16:50| a deficit of 17,000 housing units today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4610)|
| 1:16:54| and that doesn't include all the pressure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4614)|
| 1:16:56| that is coming from the newfound east Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4616)|
| 1:16:59| where everybody's moving down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4619)|
| 1:17:01| As far as apartment complexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4621)|
| 1:17:03| they are stating that the occupancy rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4623)|
| 1:17:05| of apartment complexes right now is 98.9%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4625)|
| 1:17:10| My point is, there's a tremendous amount of pressure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4630)|
| 1:17:12| for housing and the need for housing in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4632)|
| 1:17:17| The city of Knoxville's stock of land suitable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4637)|
| 1:17:19| for development is very limited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4639)|
| 1:17:20| especially ones that are flat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4640)|
| 1:17:21| and we need to manage those skillfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4641)|
| 1:17:23| In the past three years, Knoxville and Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4643)|
| 1:17:25| I think has done an excellent job in recruiting jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4645)|
| 1:17:28| and bringing people to the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4648)|
| 1:17:30| but we haven't been able to keep up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4650)|
| 1:17:31| with the building permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4651)|
| 1:17:33| Knoxville, let's see, employment in the Knoxville Metro| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4653)|
| 1:17:36| grew 170% of the rate of the building permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4656)|
| 1:17:39| so there's people moving in, there's jobs coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4659)|
| 1:17:43| but we don't have the housing for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4663)|
| 1:17:45| This is going to be an affordable housing complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4665)|
| 1:17:49| through THDA, we've got our application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4669)|
| 1:17:51| heading down to THDA now, but we just need the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4671)|
| 1:17:54| But I thought it was interesting that 70%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4674)|
| 1:17:56| of all affordable housing in the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4676)|
| 1:17:59| right now is over 40 years old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4679)|
| 1:18:02| it's 40 to 50 years old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4682)|
| 1:18:03| so we're talking about building brand new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4683)|
| 1:18:05| quality, good construction, affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4685)|
| 1:18:10| The mayor's office actually in 2019 even stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4690)|
| 1:18:13| that 56.5 of Knoxville households| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4693)|
| 1:18:16| are considered to be low income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4696)|
| 1:18:18| That's 80% or less of the area median income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4698)|
| 1:18:21| 35% of the households are paying more than 30%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4701)|
| 1:18:25| of their income towards housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4705)|
| 1:18:28| 25% of the households are paying 50% or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4708)|
| 1:18:32| Just in the last page, last two pages on there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4712)|
| 1:18:34| were just an example of an affordable housing project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4714)|
| 1:18:37| that I'm actually constructing right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| in West Knoxville off of Concord Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4719)|
| 1:18:42| So it'll be similar to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4722)|
| 1:18:45| but just wanted to pass that on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4725)|
| 1:18:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4729)|
| 1:18:50| Next person signed up to speak in favor of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4730)|
| 1:18:52| is John King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4732)|
| 1:18:55| I'm not speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4735)|
| 1:18:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4738)|
| 1:18:59| You're not speaking on this, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4739)|
| 1:19:02| Unless it's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4742)|
| 1:19:04| You're just representing him, got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4744)|
| 1:19:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4746)|
| 1:19:07| People signed up to speak in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4747)|
| 1:19:09| First person is Betty Jo Mahan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4749)|
| 1:19:12| Ms. Mahan, come up to the podium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4752)|
| 1:19:14| and state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4754)|
| 1:19:20| My name is Betty Jo Mahan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4760)|
| 1:19:22| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4762)|
| 1:19:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4763)|
| 1:19:24| 5325 Rowan Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4764)|
| 1:19:26| and I'm president of the Enskate Community Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4766)|
| 1:19:31| And we're really against the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4771)|
| 1:19:33| because it negates the 2013 general rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4773)|
| 1:19:38| that we did to have no more encroachment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4778)|
| 1:19:40| And as somebody said that Jack Sharp said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4780)|
| 1:19:43| we're trying to stand our ground and not make it change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4783)|
| 1:19:47| because we still have too much density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4787)|
| 1:19:51| And the small area plan back in 2011| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4791)|
| 1:19:55| recommended that there was down zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4795)|
| 1:19:58| needed to take place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4798)|
| 1:20:00| because we have so much multifamily already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4800)|
| 1:20:04| And the one-year plan designated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4804)|
| 1:20:07| low density residential has been in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4807)|
| 1:20:10| since the last plan update of 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4810)|
| 1:20:13| So there's no error in the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4813)|
| 1:20:15| and affordable housing is a necessity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4815)|
| 1:20:18| And Enscape has its fair share of multifamily time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4818)|
| 1:20:21| That's the whole issue here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4821)|
| 1:20:23| Affordable housing should be considered housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4823)|
| 1:20:27| not multifamily dwellings, that's what we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4827)|
| 1:20:31| That would more closely match the density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4831)|
| 1:20:33| of the neighborhood and be more compatible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4833)|
| 1:20:36| Because this would not be compatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4836)|
| 1:20:37| with the single family housing surrounding the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4837)|
| 1:20:40| other than there's a small condo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4840)|
| 1:20:42| and apartment complex behind it that's been there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4842)|
| 1:20:44| I can't remember, a long time as far as I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4844)|
| 1:20:48| So that R and five is not present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4848)|
| 1:20:50| in this little portion of the Enscape area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4850)|
| 1:20:52| other than the KCDC North Ridge Crossing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4852)|
| 1:20:55| which is across the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4855)|
| 1:20:57| and not really considered in the Enscape area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4857)|
| 1:21:01| And there are R and four and five multifamily properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4861)|
| 1:21:04| scattered about Enscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4864)|
| 1:21:07| And these are due to the many apartments and complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4867)|
| 1:21:10| already overbuilt in the Enscape area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4870)|
| 1:21:12| before the general zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4872)|
| 1:21:14| The majority of medium density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4874)|
| 1:21:16| is located in this area on Dutch Valley Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4876)|
| 1:21:19| on the outskirts of Enscape,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4879)|
| 1:21:21| I think that he was pointing out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4881)|
| 1:21:23| The roads and infrastructure of this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4883)|
| 1:21:26| have not changed any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4886)|
| 1:21:27| Bruin Road is a major collector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4887)|
| 1:21:29| but it's still narrow and curvy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4889)|
| 1:21:31| and has a hill right above the property at Broadview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4891)|
| 1:21:35| Accidents occur at this intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4895)|
| 1:21:37| and we are concerned with the safety of children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4897)|
| 1:21:41| crossing to go to the pool and park, which is across it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4901)|
| 1:21:45| So basically, we'd like you to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4905)|
| 1:21:47| to help stabilize the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4907)|
| 1:21:49| and keep this property low density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4909)|
| 1:21:53| or at least limit the density, any amount that's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4913)|
| 1:21:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4919)|
| 1:22:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4920)|
| 1:22:01| Next person signed up to speak is Patricia Dodd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4921)|
| 1:22:05| If you could come to the podium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4925)|
| 1:22:06| and you'll have up to five minutes to speak to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4926)|
| 1:22:13| I'm Patricia Dodd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4933)|
| 1:22:15| I live at 514 Broadview Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4935)|
| 1:22:17| My property is adjacent to the subject property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4937)|
| 1:22:21| This property has been scrutinized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4941)|
| 1:22:24| This is the fourth time since 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4944)|
| 1:22:29| And it has been downsized by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4949)|
| 1:22:33| That doesn't mean that it always has to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4953)|
| 1:22:37| We feel that amending the maps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4957)|
| 1:22:39| confers special privileges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4959)|
| 1:22:41| to the applicant and the investors involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4961)|
| 1:22:45| Why do we set zoning rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4965)|
| 1:22:48| if we are not going to abide by them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4968)|
| 1:22:51| There were no omissions or errors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4971)|
| 1:22:54| no changed conditions in at least 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4974)|
| 1:23:01| There's no changes in the city policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4981)|
| 1:23:03| to warrant amendments to the zoning maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4983)|
| 1:23:06| None.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4986)|
| 1:23:08| The property is not a transitional property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4988)|
| 1:23:10| between a commercial node.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4990)|
| 1:23:13| It isn't adjacent to a commercial node.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4993)|
| 1:23:16| We have a neighborhood bar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4996)|
| 1:23:18| and a pest control on the corner of Dutch Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=4998)|
| 1:23:21| It is not near that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5001)|
| 1:23:24| So why are we even here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5004)|
| 1:23:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5007)|
| 1:23:28| Affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5008)|
| 1:23:31| Someone has decided that that is a good piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5011)|
| 1:23:35| to build affordable housing on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5015)|
| 1:23:37| We're not against affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5017)|
| 1:23:40| Everybody needs an affordable place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5020)|
| 1:23:43| But do we drive through our small neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5023)|
| 1:23:45| and select every vacant piece of property that we come upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5025)|
| 1:23:49| and build an apartment building on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5029)|
| 1:23:52| That is not growing, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5032)|
| 1:23:57| The RN-5 MDRO is an extreme land use in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5037)|
| 1:24:02| It is a low-density residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5042)|
| 1:24:06| There are no sidewalks in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5046)|
| 1:24:08| only drain culverts on the side of the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5048)|
| 1:24:11| for pedestrians to walk in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5051)|
| 1:24:14| It is not really on a transit line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5054)|
| 1:24:17| It is near a transit line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5057)|
| 1:24:19| but it will be treacherous for anyone walking to the transit stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5059)|
| 1:24:25| The property isn't near grocery stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5065)|
| 1:24:28| It isn't near the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5068)|
| 1:24:30| It's not near shopping or employment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5070)|
| 1:24:34| or emergency medical services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5074)|
| 1:24:38| The nearest Walmart is in Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5078)|
| 1:24:42| Inskipp Elementary School already has three temporary buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5082)|
| 1:24:47| due to overcrowding on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5087)|
| 1:24:50| Significant grading will have to occur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5090)|
| 1:24:54| in retaining walls built to hold the soil in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5094)|
| 1:24:58| According to the topography map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5098)|
| 1:25:02| it is sloping more than 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5102)|
| 1:25:07| The drop is 60 foot from north to the south side of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5107)|
| 1:25:13| The property is in no way relatively flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5113)|
| 1:25:17| The neighborhood will honestly be adversely affected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5117)|
| 1:25:20| by sound, by sight, by lights, and property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5120)|
| 1:25:26| It is a very small neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5126)|
| 1:25:29| What about the renters on this small 4.6 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5129)|
| 1:25:33| which shares a property line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5133)|
| 1:25:35| with an already existing apartment building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5135)|
| 1:25:38| built in 1977, which had been grandfathered in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5138)|
| 1:25:43| This area in no way can support the amount of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5143)|
| 1:25:47| in the center of a small city block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5147)|
| 1:25:51| We believe the zoning ordinances and regulations are in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5151)|
| 1:25:57| to help protect neighborhoods such as ours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5157)|
| 1:26:01| as well as for planned growth of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5161)|
| 1:26:06| Let's work at planning the growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5166)|
| 1:26:08| instead of having developers and investors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5168)|
| 1:26:12| drive through our neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5172)|
| 1:26:14| seeking out any size parcel of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5174)|
| 1:26:17| to throw as many affordable housing units on it as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5177)|
| 1:26:21| There are larger parcels of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5181)|
| 1:26:23| available for this type of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5183)|
| 1:26:26| It might be the cheapest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5186)|
| 1:26:28| but not the best place for an RN-5 MDRO development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5188)|
| 1:26:34| We don't believe people are flocking to Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5194)|
| 1:26:36| to live in these conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5196)|
| 1:26:39| Actually, according to the demographics for Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5199)|
| 1:26:44| only 53.41% of affordable properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5204)|
| 1:26:50| which already exist are being rented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5210)|
| 1:26:55| We are astounded by that fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5215)|
| 1:26:58| We ask that you deny the application for map amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5218)|
| 1:27:02| and rezoning based on the zoning rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5222)|
| 1:27:05| and regulations set forth by city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5225)|
| 1:27:10| This property can be developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5230)|
| 1:27:12| and provide housing for many people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5232)|
| 1:27:15| Thank you for your time and for the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5235)|
| 1:27:18| which allows us to voice our remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5238)|

| 1:27:23| Next person signed up to speak is Alex Dodd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5243)|
| 1:27:34| My name is Alex Dodd, and I live at 514 Broadview Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5254)|
| 1:27:41| Ladies and gentlemen of city council, American Cannon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5261)|
| 1:27:44| I thank you for your time and attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5264)|
| 1:27:47| I oppose the rezoning of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5267)|
| 1:27:50| and the development of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5270)|
| 1:27:52| because I think it will set a bad precedent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5272)|
| 1:27:56| encouraging development over personal safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5276)|
| 1:28:02| As Mr. Huber noted, this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5282)|
| 1:28:05| will be directly across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5285)|
| 1:28:08| from Inskip Community Park and Pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5288)|
| 1:28:11| I love that park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5291)|
| 1:28:14| It has what Mr. Huber said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5294)|
| 1:28:17| It has tennis courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5297)|
| 1:28:18| It has a big picnic shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5298)|
| 1:28:21| It has a playground, a walking trail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5301)|
| 1:28:23| Frisbee golf, and the pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5303)|
| 1:28:27| Well, I think everybody who wants to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5307)|
| 1:28:30| should be allowed to enjoy that park, and that's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5310)|
| 1:28:35| Every Saturday and Sunday through the summer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5315)|
| 1:28:38| when the pool is open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5318)|
| 1:28:39| there's no parking available at the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5319)|
| 1:28:42| It's all full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5322)|
| 1:28:43| The only access to the park is on foot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5323)|
| 1:28:47| walking on narrow two-lane Bruin Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5327)|
| 1:28:52| that has no shoulder, just drainage ditches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5332)|
| 1:28:57| To be perfectly honest, when he builds this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5337)|
| 1:29:01| it's going to increase the number of traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5341)|
| 1:29:05| on Bruin Road and the number of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5345)|
| 1:29:08| who are going to want to go over to the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5348)|
| 1:29:12| Unless the city of Knoxville is willing to invest the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5352)|
| 1:29:16| in redoing Bruin Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5356)|
| 1:29:18| unless Mr. Huber is willing to invest the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5358)|
| 1:29:21| to build a pedestrian bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5361)|
| 1:29:24| that will allow people living in his development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5364)|
| 1:29:27| to safely cross Bruin Road to the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5367)|
| 1:29:31| we are just encouraging development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5371)|
| 1:29:34| at the risk of people's lives, and that's just a tragedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5374)|
| 1:29:39| Again, like I said, thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5379)|
| 1:29:43| Thank you, council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5383)|
| 1:29:44| That concludes the people signed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5384)|
| 1:29:45| to speak to this agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5385)|
| 1:29:50| There's nobody else signed up to speak to this agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5390)|
| 1:29:58| I'm sorry, it's you have to sign up with each new meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5398)|
| 1:30:02| so plus the council rules are three in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5402)|
| 1:30:06| and three opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5406)|
| 1:30:07| That's the council rules, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5407)|
| 1:30:10| Did we make a motion to amend the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5410)|
| 1:30:16| to let the gentleman speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5416)|
| 1:30:18| If he was signed up earlier when it was postponed last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5418)|
| 1:30:24| I know we all need to follow the rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5424)|
| 1:30:26| but I'm thinking that this might be one of those times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5426)|
| 1:30:29| when you can sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5429)|
| 1:30:30| Because I understand he was here last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5430)|
| 1:30:34| he didn't know he needed to sign up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5434)|
| 1:30:37| Okay, Mr. Thomas has moved to suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5437)|
| 1:30:44| It's been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5444)|
| 1:30:46| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5446)|
| 1:30:47| All those in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5447)|
| 1:30:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5450)|
| 1:30:50| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5450)|
| 1:30:51| Okay, if you could come to the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5451)|
| 1:30:53| state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5453)|
| 1:30:55| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5455)|
| 1:30:59| Okay, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5459)|
| 1:31:00| My name is Ralph Siglin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5460)|
| 1:31:02| I live at 518 Broadview Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5462)|
| 1:31:05| You should have a paperwork like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5465)|
| 1:31:11| and there are two maps, and I'd like to refer to the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5471)|
| 1:31:15| One map is 4A22SP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5475)|
| 1:31:20| and the other map is 4A22RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5480)|
| 1:31:25| Those are the two maps I'd like to refer to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5485)|
| 1:31:29| Okay, as it's already been said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5489)|
| 1:31:32| there's already a plan, a small area plan for INSTIT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5492)|
| 1:31:36| And when you look at the recommendations of the council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5496)|
| 1:31:42| it's like they didn't even know it was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5502)|
| 1:31:45| But if you read, and I sent each of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5505)|
| 1:31:47| and I hope you got the email,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5507)|
| 1:31:49| I sent each of you an email highlighting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5509)|
| 1:31:53| some of the things that were in that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5513)|
| 1:31:55| All right, the plan itself was approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5515)|
| 1:32:01| by this council on April 19th, 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5521)|
| 1:32:06| And then we did re-coding of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5526)|
| 1:32:10| You also approved it on April 13th, 2019| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5530)|
| 1:32:15| by no changes to it, so there was no changes in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5535)|
| 1:32:20| A couple of things that the original plan said was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5540)|
| 1:32:23| and I'd just like to read this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5543)|
| 1:32:25| unfortunately, when we went to the new code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5545)|
| 1:32:28| we changed what the numbers and letters meant, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5548)|
| 1:32:34| On pages nine and 11, it's talking about zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5554)|
| 1:32:39| and it says 57% of the land is zoned R2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5559)|
| 1:32:43| which could be zoned to low density residential areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5563)|
| 1:32:46| such as R1 or R1A, which I believe now is R2 and R1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5566)|
| 1:32:52| would be more consistent with the existing housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5572)|
| 1:32:58| And it also talks about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5578)|
| 1:33:00| there's people have asked to have down zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5580)|
| 1:33:04| and it says this approach is used in the area of Innscape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5584)|
| 1:33:07| where zoning is inconsistent with the character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5587)|
| 1:33:09| of the neighborhoods, which would help protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5589)|
| 1:33:12| low density residential areas from the encroachment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5592)|
| 1:33:16| of apartment complexes or high density development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5596)|
| 1:33:21| that are not compatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5601)|
| 1:33:23| with the existing development pattern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5603)|
| 1:33:27| That's what the council approved in 2011, and again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5607)|
| 1:33:34| All right, it also talks, pages 21 and 22,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5614)|
| 1:33:37| it says the one-year plan is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5617)|
| 1:33:40| The section plan needs to be updated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5620)|
| 1:33:42| to reflect the proposal of the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5622)|
| 1:33:46| These changes will be corrected as part of the approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5626)|
| 1:33:50| of the Innscape small area plan, which you did in 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5630)|
| 1:33:56| Also, decades ago, R2 zoning was placed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5636)|
| 1:34:01| over the Innscape area with little regard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5641)|
| 1:34:03| for existing building environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5643)|
| 1:34:06| This is not atypical for older residential neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5646)|
| 1:34:11| in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5651)|
| 1:34:12| However, most of the other neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5652)|
| 1:34:15| have already been rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5655)|
| 1:34:17| to a low density residential district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5657)|
| 1:34:20| such as Orphan Gill, Old Knoxville, or an overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5660)|
| 1:34:26| which has helped protect the characteristics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5666)|
| 1:34:29| of the neighborhood, such as Fort Sanders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5669)|
| 1:34:33| Lonsdale, and Oakwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5673)|
| 1:34:35| All right, quickly moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5675)|
| 1:34:37| What are we talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5677)|
| 1:34:39| So if we take all the houses, and if you look at the map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5679)|
| 1:34:43| if you find Broadview Drive, so we're doing Broadview Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5683)|
| 1:34:48| we're doing Costner, and we're doing Greenland Dam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5688)|
| 1:34:53| All right, if you look at that map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5693)|
| 1:34:55| if you notice, there's two MDRs in there, two, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5695)|
| 1:35:03| Everything else is, and if you look at the other map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5703)|
| 1:35:07| everything else is R2, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5707)|
| 1:35:13| So what's the breakdown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5713)|
| 1:35:14| Presently, there are a total of 142 residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5714)|
| 1:35:19| that's apartment, individual apartments, et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5719)|
| 1:35:24| All right, this plan wants to add 120.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5724)|
| 1:35:28| If you put 2.5 people in each of the apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5728)|
| 1:35:32| okay, you're gonna come up with 300 people, all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5732)|
| 1:35:37| What can be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5737)|
| 1:35:38| Well, if it's left RN1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5738)|
| 1:35:40| we can put at least 15 homes on that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5740)|
| 1:35:44| or if you go to RN2, because the lots are smaller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5744)|
| 1:35:47| you can put at least 30 homes in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5747)|
| 1:35:51| So we, as a community, would like this to stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5751)|
| 1:35:54| the way we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5754)|
| 1:35:57| There is gonna be houses put there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5757)|
| 1:36:00| The question is, we're hopeful there'll be houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5760)|
| 1:36:05| not what we're going to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5765)|
| 1:36:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5769)|
| 1:36:11| Thank you, council, that concludes public forum on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5771)|
| 1:36:16| Looking for any discussion from the council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5776)|
| 1:36:19| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5779)|
| 1:36:21| Just a couple of questions from planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5781)|
| 1:36:26| We heard from the residents about kind of a long history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5786)|
| 1:36:31| of zoning in this neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5791)|
| 1:36:34| perhaps to keep it down-zoned more or less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5794)|
| 1:36:38| to make it more friendly, I suppose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5798)|
| 1:36:42| My understanding of documents that I received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5802)|
| 1:36:46| staff, they,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5806)|
| 1:36:49| claims that 2014,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5809)|
| 1:36:55| the county was made to rezone RN1A to RN2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5815)|
| 1:37:01| That was denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5821)|
| 1:37:07| And then, later, in 2016,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5827)|
| 1:37:12| there was another county that was made to rezone it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5832)|
| 1:37:17| from RN1A to RN2 again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5837)|
| 1:37:21| That was turned down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5841)|
| 1:37:24| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5844)|
| 1:37:27| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5847)|
| 1:37:31| It is a six-year policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5851)|
| 1:37:39| It's not even up to RN2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5859)|
| 1:37:49| So, as recently as six years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5869)|
| 1:37:51| the policy was not even to go up to RN2 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5871)|
| 1:37:57| And now, we're making this leap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5877)|
| 1:37:59| and there has not been significant changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5879)|
| 1:38:03| in that neighborhood all the way from R1 to RN5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5883)|
| 1:38:12| And that is contrary according to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5892)|
| 1:38:15| in line with what the neighbors have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5895)|
| 1:38:17| we've been involved in this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5897)|
| 1:38:21| and have lived in that neighborhood for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5901)|
| 1:38:25| So, this is an abrupt change in longstanding policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5905)|
| 1:38:32| about the amount of density and zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5912)|
| 1:38:37| in that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5917)|
| 1:38:40| Now, these were designed that denied at RN2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5920)|
| 1:38:46| My assessment, talking to neighbors at the present time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5926)|
| 1:38:51| is probably that zoning now is RN2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5931)|
| 1:38:58| And that would be a upgrade and increase in density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5938)|
| 1:39:05| to what we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5945)|
| 1:39:08| But it would be a manageable increase in density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5948)|
| 1:39:12| And we all on this council are passionate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5952)|
| 1:39:18| about housing and affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5958)|
| 1:39:22| And my votes indicate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5962)|
| 1:39:26| And recently, I supported and moved for affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5966)|
| 1:39:35| in Enskip, not very far in this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5975)|
| 1:39:40| for over 70 units that would go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5980)|
| 1:39:43| through the affordable housing program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5983)|
| 1:39:46| Another example is in my own neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5986)|
| 1:39:49| Oakwood Lincoln Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5989)|
| 1:39:51| I've supported rezoning for multi-unit housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5991)|
| 1:39:57| on Oswald Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5997)|
| 1:39:59| So, not carte blanche against housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=5999)|
| 1:40:03| I'm really for it and more of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6003)|
| 1:40:06| But it has to be site-specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6006)|
| 1:40:11| And we don't need to undermine existing neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6011)|
| 1:40:19| to try to accommodate something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6019)|
| 1:40:22| when there are other locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6022)|
| 1:40:26| and actually more suitable locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6026)|
| 1:40:29| for this type of housing that would benefit the residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6029)|
| 1:40:33| of that housing even more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6033)|
| 1:40:36| This area here, the proposal would introduce 120 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6036)|
| 1:40:48| on a two-lane road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6048)|
| 1:40:52| The road has no shoulders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6052)|
| 1:40:55| It would be an engineering feat to expand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6055)|
| 1:40:58| I've been out there as recently as this morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6058)|
| 1:41:01| just to make sure you know what I knew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6061)|
| 1:41:05| There's banks there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6065)|
| 1:41:08| It's gonna be a traffic nightmare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6068)|
| 1:41:12| The estimate is that 1,200 trips per day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6072)|
| 1:41:20| would result in this here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6080)|
| 1:41:23| The infrastructure is not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6083)|
| 1:41:26| The trend that this council has been supporting recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6086)|
| 1:41:30| and it's the right trend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6090)|
| 1:41:32| is you put multifamily unit in dense housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6092)|
| 1:41:37| in places where the infrastructure is in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6097)|
| 1:41:42| or can be adjusted slightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6102)|
| 1:41:46| Building it inside traditional neighborhood zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6106)|
| 1:41:49| is just asking for problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6109)|
| 1:41:52| It's asking for more expense from the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6112)|
| 1:41:55| to make adjustments to increase density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6115)|
| 1:41:59| to where it shouldn't be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6119)|
| 1:42:02| And so I'm gonna open it up, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6122)|
| 1:42:05| to comments from the council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6125)|
| 1:42:07| but I am strongly, strongly inclined to deny this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6127)|
| 1:42:18| And number one, we can talk about this more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6138)|
| 1:42:21| but I don't even think that it meets the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6141)|
| 1:42:26| the requirements of the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6146)|
| 1:42:29| or the requirements of the one-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6149)|
| 1:42:34| even before we get to the issue of zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6154)|
| 1:42:37| Thank you for your patience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6157)|
| 1:42:38| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6158)|
| 1:42:39| I look forward to hearing from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6159)|
| 1:42:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6162)|
| 1:42:43| Council Member McKenzie, Singh, Parker, then Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6163)|
| 1:42:49| We're saying, okay, Council Member Singh was first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6169)|
| 1:42:51| I didn't, I hadn't, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6171)|
| 1:42:53| Council Member Singh, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6173)|
| 1:42:54| Yes, I have a couple questions for MDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6174)|
| 1:42:58| What was the, it was a unanimous vote in favor of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6178)|
| 1:43:02| for MDC, and the staff also supported this change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6182)|
| 1:43:06| What was the thinking behind that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6186)|
| 1:43:08| when previously we are in two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6188)|
| 1:43:14| I will say with the adoption of the new zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6194)|
| 1:43:17| we have a wide variety of zone districts now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6197)|
| 1:43:21| for residential zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6201)|
| 1:43:23| whereas before we had much more limited ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6203)|
| 1:43:27| This one, we were looking at the amenities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6207)|
| 1:43:31| that were in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6211)|
| 1:43:32| So the park, the, there are two, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6212)|
| 1:43:37| CAT lines that are in relative close proximity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6217)|
| 1:43:41| to this site as well in comparison to a lot of other areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6221)|
| 1:43:46| You know, staff feels that the infrastructure that's there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6226)|
| 1:43:50| and the fact that the sidewalk plan for the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6230)|
| 1:43:53| also mentions the need for a proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6233)|
| 1:43:56| for a sidewalk on Bruin Road as being part of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6236)|
| 1:44:00| justification for the increased in zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6240)|
| 1:44:02| and the change in the plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6242)|
| 1:44:04| Ms. Albertson, I know Director Brooks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6244)|
| 1:44:06| couldn't be here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6246)|
| 1:44:07| Could you just give us, introduce yourself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6247)|
| 1:44:09| and what your role is with the planning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6249)|
| 1:44:11| Yes, I'm Liz Albertson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6251)|
| 1:44:13| I'm a principal planner with Knott's Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6253)|
| 1:44:15| Thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6255)|
| 1:44:16| Ms. Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6256)|
| 1:44:17| Mr. Huber, how did you choose this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6257)|
| 1:44:22| for this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6262)|
| 1:44:23| Well, that's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6263)|
| 1:44:26| Truthfully, it's available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6266)|
| 1:44:28| I mean, there's a lot of places that you could try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6268)|
| 1:44:30| to put affordable housing, as Mr. Thomas said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6270)|
| 1:44:34| but they're not always for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6274)|
| 1:44:35| That's the hard, you know, hard position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6275)|
| 1:44:38| Isn't there also, does the state has recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6278)|
| 1:44:42| or certain areas where you can apply for the tax credits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6282)|
| 1:44:46| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6286)|
| 1:44:47| I think you're, what you're referring to is a QCT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6287)|
| 1:44:50| or a Qualified Census Tract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6290)|
| 1:44:52| They do, HUD and THDA do classify different areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6292)|
| 1:44:59| of Qualified Census Tract saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6299)|
| 1:45:00| we feel like there is more of a need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6300)|
| 1:45:03| for affordable housing in these certain areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6303)|
| 1:45:06| So we would prefer that you put affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6306)|
| 1:45:09| in those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6309)|
| 1:45:10| And the Bruin Road area is in one such QCT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6310)|
| 1:45:14| that they support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6314)|
| 1:45:15| We talked about sidewalks a bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6315)|
| 1:45:17| which I'll let some other people ask questions about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6317)|
| 1:45:22| Probably get back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6322)|
| 1:45:24| Yeah, and if I may, with the sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6324)|
| 1:45:27| we talked about it a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6327)|
| 1:45:28| We've got about 550 linear feet of road on Bruin Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6328)|
| 1:45:34| And part of our plan, once it gets done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6334)|
| 1:45:36| will include us installing at our cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6336)|
| 1:45:39| a sidewalk, the first one that we're going to install| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6339)|
| 1:45:42| and us installing at our cost, a sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6342)|
| 1:45:46| the full length of the property for 550 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6346)|
| 1:45:48| Now, granted, it does not go down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6348)|
| 1:45:50| all the way down to Dutch Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6350)|
| 1:45:52| because I don't have control over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6352)|
| 1:45:54| But I can control what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6354)|
| 1:45:57| That's 550 feet that we will install sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6357)|
| 1:46:01| Thank you, Council Member McKenzie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6361)|
| 1:46:03| and then Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6363)|
| 1:46:04| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6364)|
| 1:46:06| For the planning staff, I see here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6366)|
| 1:46:09| here are some notes under someone who spoke| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6369)|
| 1:46:13| at the meetings and public comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6373)|
| 1:46:15| that brought up also the need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6375)|
| 1:46:18| for potentially a second entrance, Sharp Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6378)|
| 1:46:23| Could you validate if that would be accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6383)|
| 1:46:30| Sharp Lane does, quote, unquote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6390)|
| 1:46:32| get into the backside of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6392)|
| 1:46:35| But at this point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6395)|
| 1:46:36| we have not seen the development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6396)|
| 1:46:38| or the City of Knoxville has not seen a development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6398)|
| 1:46:40| that would say he'd use it or not to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6400)|
| 1:46:42| But we just noted that as reference that it does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6402)|
| 1:46:45| Sharp Lane does, but the backside of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6405)|
| 1:46:49| Would it be appropriate for a traffic study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6409)|
| 1:46:50| to be done adding this number of units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6410)|
| 1:46:55| He has been requested to do a traffic impact analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6415)|
| 1:46:59| So I think that is either started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6419)|
| 1:47:01| or will be underway shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6421)|
| 1:47:03| And then as it relates to sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6423)|
| 1:47:05| what is the timeline for sidewalks on Brown Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6425)|
| 1:47:11| Does anyone have that information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6431)|
| 1:47:15| Harold Cannon, Director of Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6435)|
| 1:47:18| I'll try to call it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6438)|
| 1:47:19| but for some reason I'm locked out right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6439)|
| 1:47:21| but I will get that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6441)|
| 1:47:23| Okay, if you could share that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6443)|
| 1:47:24| with maybe all the council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6444)|
| 1:47:26| I think one really important fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6446)|
| 1:47:31| that was brought up around safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6451)|
| 1:47:33| we're looking at a family property across from a park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6453)|
| 1:47:37| with a road that sounds like it has quite a bit of traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6457)|
| 1:47:41| that already flows through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6461)|
| 1:47:42| I am somewhat concerned about the safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6462)|
| 1:47:45| of people crossing that road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6465)|
| 1:47:47| especially children as relates to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6467)|
| 1:47:51| Definitely not opposed to affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6471)|
| 1:47:54| but I do think that we have to be really intentional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6474)|
| 1:47:56| and look at all the factors that go into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6476)|
| 1:48:00| I'm also curious as my colleague, Council Member Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6480)|
| 1:48:04| the fact that this has been denied for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6484)|
| 1:48:07| And then, I mean, I know that things change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6487)|
| 1:48:09| visions change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6489)|
| 1:48:11| but the history that it had been denied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6491)|
| 1:48:14| is very interesting as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6494)|
| 1:48:15| So I just wanted to put that out there, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6495)|
| 1:48:18| Thank you, Council Member McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6498)|
| 1:48:19| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6499)|
| 1:48:22| Yeah, so we're trying to get one device powered up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6502)|
| 1:48:25| Director Cannon, so I could see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6505)|
| 1:48:27| I had texted you and asked you about the sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6507)|
| 1:48:30| but I feel like I brought up the wrong document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6510)|
| 1:48:34| There's a couple of different documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6514)|
| 1:48:35| about the sidewalk study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6515)|
| 1:48:36| There's like an executive summary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6516)|
| 1:48:38| and then there's the full 268 pages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6518)|
| 1:48:40| and I can't do a control find on this iPad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6520)|
| 1:48:45| So the one I was looking at didn't show it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6525)|
| 1:48:47| in the fifth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6527)|
| 1:48:48| And I think what's curious to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6528)|
| 1:48:51| is that we have city-owned property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6531)|
| 1:48:54| on a full side of Bruin there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6534)|
| 1:48:57| So right now, I'm just commenting on the sidewalk issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6537)|
| 1:49:00| And from what I could see, I may be wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6540)|
| 1:49:03| because I'm not looking at the full document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6543)|
| 1:49:05| because somebody mentioned Bruin being in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6545)|
| 1:49:07| for sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6547)|
| 1:49:09| I don't see it in the sidewalk study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6549)|
| 1:49:11| but it might be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6551)|
| 1:49:12| It would make sense to me that it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6552)|
| 1:49:13| I will comment that the roadway is marked with sharrows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6553)|
| 1:49:21| The roadway is marked with sharrows for cycling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6561)|
| 1:49:25| I would not ride my bike on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6565)|
| 1:49:27| And that comes from somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6567)|
| 1:49:28| who used to ride 350 miles a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6568)|
| 1:49:31| I just don't find that to be a safe place to ride a bike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6571)|
| 1:49:34| So I think we really, regardless of the zoning discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6574)|
| 1:49:40| I think we have a workshop coming up on the sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6580)|
| 1:49:42| I would highly look at that area as a place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6582)|
| 1:49:45| to have a sidewalk and or a greenway there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6585)|
| 1:49:49| because you've got a greenway in that park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6589)|
| 1:49:51| and then you've got a DARE park down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6591)|
| 1:49:53| and you've got a bus line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6593)|
| 1:49:55| And I did see a guy walking, I think it's on Coster today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6595)|
| 1:50:00| walking on the white line ditch, trying to get somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6600)|
| 1:50:06| And so there are pedestrians that are walking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6606)|
| 1:50:10| to get places to their home, to their jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6610)|
| 1:50:13| And so there's a great need there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6613)|
| 1:50:15| Unfortunately, we can't afford all the things that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6615)|
| 1:50:19| To the subject matter at hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6619)|
| 1:50:20| I would like to ask the Planning Commission staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6620)|
| 1:50:24| about a small area plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6624)|
| 1:50:27| So the most current small area plan for this area is 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6627)|
| 1:50:35| That seems approximate by 2011, 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6635)|
| 1:50:38| Sector plan is, I think, probably 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6638)|
| 1:50:41| The in-script was 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6641)|
| 1:50:44| I'm sorry, I'm Jeff Welch, Planning Department staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6644)|
| 1:50:47| So the small area plan is 2011?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6647)|
| 1:50:50| I believe so, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6650)|
| 1:50:51| Okay, and so that was during the recession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6651)|
| 1:50:54| There wasn't a lot of building go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6654)|
| 1:50:56| There wasn't a lot of demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6656)|
| 1:50:57| There weren't things selling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6657)|
| 1:51:00| I will say, we do have a significant change right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6660)|
| 1:51:04| If you own property to rent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6664)|
| 1:51:07| you got a line of people trying to rent from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6667)|
| 1:51:10| I mean, we are really hard-pressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6670)|
| 1:51:12| to have enough housing here, and that's the struggle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6672)|
| 1:51:16| But one of the questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6676)|
| 1:51:17| I had a conversation with Director Cannon this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6677)|
| 1:51:20| One of my concerns, to tag onto what Councilman Thomas says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6680)|
| 1:51:26| is like, okay, I think it's great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6686)|
| 1:51:28| the idea of having apartments right across from a park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6688)|
| 1:51:32| but I'm not sure there hasn't been a traffic study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6692)|
| 1:51:34| to look at how do you get those kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6694)|
| 1:51:36| across the street to the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6696)|
| 1:51:39| They're going to build a sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6699)|
| 1:51:40| but we need to build the complementary sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6700)|
| 1:51:43| going the different directions to make that feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6703)|
| 1:51:46| And so it's kind of a quandary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6706)|
| 1:51:50| So I think I have other colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6710)|
| 1:51:53| that are left yet to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6713)|
| 1:51:56| and so I'll leave it at that for the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6716)|
| 1:51:59| Council Member Fugate, your line is not working again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6719)|
| 1:52:01| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6721)|
| 1:52:02| I'm pulling on the wire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6722)|
| 1:52:04| I'm about to take it personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6724)|
| 1:52:05| But, I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6725)|
| 1:52:07| Then we'll go back to Council Member Smith in testimony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6727)|
| 1:52:11| Just a quick question, or a couple of comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6731)|
| 1:52:14| One, I do think the change in situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6734)|
| 1:52:18| is the housing crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6738)|
| 1:52:21| The city of Knoxville is in a housing crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6741)|
| 1:52:23| as is Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6743)|
| 1:52:27| And every time we meet as a council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6747)|
| 1:52:31| there's discussion about more money for affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6751)|
| 1:52:35| Where do we find places to put more housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6755)|
| 1:52:39| The city isn't like the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6759)|
| 1:52:41| We don't have a lot of wide open spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6761)|
| 1:52:44| to build housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6764)|
| 1:52:45| So that is a fact, and that makes it hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6765)|
| 1:52:49| So I struggle with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6769)|
| 1:52:51| because I share your sentiments, Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6771)|
| 1:52:55| But my other question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6775)|
| 1:53:02| what do you mean by affordable housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6782)|
| 1:53:04| I mean, one of the things I hear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6784)|
| 1:53:06| because people assume Section 8 vouchers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6786)|
| 1:53:09| they think it's KCBC housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6789)|
| 1:53:12| My understanding is this is a project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6792)|
| 1:53:14| that we get THDA tax credits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6794)|
| 1:53:17| which would make your ability to build a housing complex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6797)|
| 1:53:22| an apartment complex, cheaply enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6802)|
| 1:53:25| that the rents could be lower than they would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6805)|
| 1:53:30| if you built it without any subsidy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6810)|
| 1:53:34| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6814)|
| 1:53:35| Yes, that is correct in a nutshell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6815)|
| 1:53:38| THDA, it's called the tax credit program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6818)|
| 1:53:40| where if it is, as Ms. Singh was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6820)|
| 1:53:44| in a certain area, in the QCT area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6824)|
| 1:53:47| they will allow tax credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6827)|
| 1:53:50| If you put all the boxes, check all the boxes in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6830)|
| 1:53:54| they will award that project tax credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6834)|
| 1:53:57| We monetize those tax credits on the secondary market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6837)|
| 1:54:01| and take whatever money that we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6841)|
| 1:54:03| and put it directly into the construction side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6843)|
| 1:54:06| which lowers our permanent loan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6846)|
| 1:54:08| and hence allows us to lower the rent prices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6848)|
| 1:54:12| for that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6852)|
| 1:54:14| Thank you for explaining that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6854)|
| 1:54:15| because I think sometimes people hear affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6855)|
| 1:54:18| and it means all kinds of things to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6858)|
| 1:54:20| but there are different ways to do affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6860)|
| 1:54:23| The THDA way with tax credits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6863)|
| 1:54:25| makes your carrying costs for the loan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6865)|
| 1:54:29| cheap enough or cheaper so that rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6869)|
| 1:54:32| does not have to be what it would be otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6872)|
| 1:54:35| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6875)|
| 1:54:37| When is the application due for the tax credits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6877)|
| 1:54:41| We must turn this in with zoning and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6881)|
| 1:54:44| The package together has to be in the first week of July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6884)|
| 1:54:48| Okay, so zoning must come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6888)|
| 1:54:51| before you even apply for the tax credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6891)|
| 1:54:53| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6893)|
| 1:54:54| They won't accept the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6894)|
| 1:54:56| unless we can show that the zoning is in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6896)|
| 1:54:58| Okay, and what would be the financial impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6898)|
| 1:55:04| to the project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6904)|
| 1:55:05| Would a project be feasible with R2 zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6905)|
| 1:55:10| Unfortunately not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6910)|
| 1:55:13| Yeah, part of it is economies to scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6913)|
| 1:55:17| with the construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6917)|
| 1:55:18| Another part is the type of construction it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6918)|
| 1:55:22| which is apartments versus duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6922)|
| 1:55:25| I mean, RN2 does allow duplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6925)|
| 1:55:28| but the density would be much lower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6928)|
| 1:55:31| and the construction costs would be much higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6931)|
| 1:55:33| So we're trying to fit it in, make it affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6933)|
| 1:55:38| I mean, I just share everyone's concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6938)|
| 1:55:41| and frustration as you talk about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6941)|
| 1:55:43| because you can only buy land that is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6943)|
| 1:55:46| And that makes this very difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6946)|
| 1:55:49| because we don't have much land in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6949)|
| 1:55:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6952)|
| 1:55:54| Thank you, Council Member Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6954)|
| 1:55:55| and then Council Member Testimony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6955)|
| 1:55:58| I believe there was 120 units proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6958)|
| 1:56:00| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6960)|
| 1:56:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6962)|
| 1:56:03| That was the initial proposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6963)|
| 1:56:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6965)|
| 1:56:06| And another question for planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6966)|
| 1:56:07| What is the maximum number of units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6967)|
| 1:56:11| that could be built on RN2 versus RN5?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6971)|
| 1:56:16| It's a difficult question to answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6976)|
| 1:56:18| just because of the variety of setbacks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6978)|
| 1:56:19| but we think somewhere maybe in the 30 to 40 range| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6979)|
| 1:56:23| might be, but again, the setbacks are different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6983)|
| 1:56:28| in the type of development that you put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6988)|
| 1:56:30| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6990)|
| 1:56:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6991)|
| 1:56:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6992)|
| 1:56:34| I appreciate your willingness to give the number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6994)|
| 1:56:36| because I know planners don't just don't like to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6996)|
| 1:56:38| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6998)|
| 1:56:39| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=6999)|
| 1:56:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7000)|
| 1:56:41| Every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7001)|
| 1:56:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7001)|
| 1:56:44| Is there a sidewalk or infrastructure plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7004)|
| 1:56:47| to support this in addition to what the applicant has said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7007)|
| 1:56:54| I had some folks have my back and they say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7014)|
| 1:56:57| it is or should be in the plan, the thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7017)|
| 1:57:00| and we will get that information to Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7020)|
| 1:57:02| as well as to the applicant, just so they had requested it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7022)|
| 1:57:05| I'll make sure that they have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7025)|
| 1:57:08| There's another component to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7028)|
| 1:57:10| that I'm obligated to let you all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7030)|
| 1:57:12| and that is the draft priority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7032)|
| 1:57:15| of what that sidewalk would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7035)|
| 1:57:16| This study was done prior to a proposal like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7036)|
| 1:57:20| We need to see what the priority is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7040)|
| 1:57:22| and just remembering that in this overall study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7042)|
| 1:57:25| there's $2 billion worth of sidewalk needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7045)|
| 1:57:28| throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7048)|
| 1:57:30| So you can adjust the priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7050)|
| 1:57:32| A billion with a B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7052)|
| 1:57:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7054)|
| 1:57:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7054)|
| 1:57:35| And you all will have the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7055)|
| 1:57:39| to look at those priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7059)|
| 1:57:41| and reset these or draft priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7061)|
| 1:57:42| but we owe that information to you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7062)|
| 1:57:45| One of the reasons, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7065)|
| 1:57:48| One of the reasons I brought up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7068)|
| 1:57:49| sidewalk infrastructure earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7069)|
| 1:57:50| that led to the capital improvement plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7070)|
| 1:57:52| is that public infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7072)|
| 1:57:55| is a significant barrier to housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7075)|
| 1:57:57| We all wish there was more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7077)|
| 1:57:58| There's a billion dollar list of sidewalks to build,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7078)|
| 1:58:01| but sidewalks are not just for safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7081)|
| 1:58:04| They are legitimately a barrier for density in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7084)|
| 1:58:10| Haven't seen enough of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7090)|
| 1:58:11| Some in the first district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7091)|
| 1:58:13| people are much more likely to go along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7093)|
| 1:58:14| with greater density in their legacy neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7094)|
| 1:58:18| when there's infrastructure around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7098)|
| 1:58:19| to walk around safely across the street back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7099)|
| 1:58:22| So public infrastructure, particularly sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7102)|
| 1:58:26| is a barrier to housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7106)|
| 1:58:27| I just want to say that for everybody that will listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7107)|
| 1:58:38| I know affordable housing is important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7118)|
| 1:58:39| to everybody on this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7119)|
| 1:58:41| We've committed $50 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7121)|
| 1:58:42| in an affordable trust housing fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7122)|
| 1:58:46| We've voted multiple times to support affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7126)|
| 1:58:51| particularly in corridors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7131)|
| 1:58:52| but also I think in areas where there is comparable density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7132)|
| 1:58:58| or slightly lesser density than what's been proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7138)|
| 1:59:01| So jumping from RN1 to RN5 is quite a leap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7141)|
| 1:59:05| from 30 to 40 units to 120 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7145)|
| 1:59:08| I just think that's a lot of shock to the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7148)|
| 1:59:11| So I think incremental density is healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7151)|
| 1:59:15| I think particularly in a circumstance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7155)|
| 1:59:17| where this has been assessed multiple times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7157)|
| 1:59:20| neighborhood is weighed in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7160)|
| 1:59:22| they may never support any more density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7162)|
| 1:59:25| but I think asking folks to walk one square on a sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7165)|
| 1:59:31| is different than asking them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7171)|
| 1:59:32| to take a big leap across a road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7172)|
| 1:59:35| So also want to kind of advocate for plan development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7175)|
| 1:59:38| So I know that doesn't work everywhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7178)|
| 1:59:40| but I think one of the issues with increasing density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7180)|
| 1:59:45| where this is such a high level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7185)|
| 1:59:49| is that what you're proposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7189)|
| 1:59:51| is not the only thing that could ever go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7191)|
| 1:59:53| The properties will be sold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7193)|
| 1:59:54| or if a deal falls through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7194)|
| 1:59:56| or the tax increment financing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7196)|
| 1:59:57| this body will have approved that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7197)|
| 1:59:59| and then whoever buys it next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7199)|
| 2:00:01| can do something different than what you propose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7201)|
| 2:00:03| So we've got a new plan development process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7203)|
| 2:00:08| It's in action across the city in a few different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7208)|
| 2:00:10| So I would just advocate for where there is density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7210)|
| 2:00:14| beyond one step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7214)|
| 2:00:16| I think the plan development's a good way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7216)|
| 2:00:18| to secure promises made and fulfill promises made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7218)|
| 2:00:25| So I'll let my colleagues ask some more questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7225)|
| 2:00:28| but this is quite a big leap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7228)|
| 2:00:30| from 30 to 40 units to 100 in front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7230)|
| 2:00:34| Thank you, Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7234)|
| 2:00:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7236)|
| 2:00:39| One thing that I'll say is I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7239)|
| 2:00:41| that it's a little bit concerning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7241)|
| 2:00:44| that we've got our Knoxville-Knox County Planning Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7244)|
| 2:00:51| We have a planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220531?start=7251)|
