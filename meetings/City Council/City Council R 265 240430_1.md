| 2:49:41| a more responsible and equitable approach to the city addressing the city's financial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10181)|
| 2:49:45| challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10185)|
| 2:49:46| Taxpayers should not be held responsible for the city's fiscal mismanagement and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10186)|
| 2:49:50| is imperative that the council explores alternative solutions that do not place undue burden on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10190)|
| 2:49:56| residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10196)|
| 2:49:57| Let us work together to ensure that the city's finances are managed in a responsible, transparent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10197)|
| 2:50:01| and accountable manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10201)|

| 2:50:27| What's good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10227)|
| 2:50:27| It's Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10227)|
| 2:50:28| I live somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10228)|
| 2:50:30| Council members, distinguished guests, today I stand before you to vehemently oppose the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10230)|
| 2:50:39| passage of Ordinance 12B, which seeks to levy a tax on all taxable properties within the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10239)|
| 2:50:44| city of Knoxville to fund the General Fund and Debt Service Fund operations and obligations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10244)|
| 2:50:50| for the upcoming fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10250)|
| 2:50:53| This ordinance represents an unjust burden on the hard-working citizens of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10253)|
| 2:50:58| who should not be forced to bear the consequences of our city's financial mismanagement and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10258)|
| 2:51:03| poor budgeting decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10263)|
| 2:51:05| First and foremost, let's address the fundamental principle at stake here, accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10265)|
| 2:51:10| It is unconscionable to ask the citizens of Knoxville to foot the bill for the city's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10270)|
| 2:51:15| financial woes, which are largely the result of mismanagement, overspending, and a lack| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10275)|
| 2:51:20| of fiscal responsibility on the part of city officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10280)|
| 2:51:24| Rather than imposing additional taxes on already burdened taxpayers, we must demand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10284)|
| 2:51:28| accountability from those responsible for overseeing the city's finances and demand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10288)|
| 2:51:33| transparency in the budgeting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10293)|
| 2:51:36| Moreover, the passage of Ordinance 12B sends a clear message to the citizens of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10296)|
| 2:51:41| that their voices and concerns are being disregarded in favor of maintaining the status quo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10301)|
| 2:51:46| By imposing additional taxes without addressing the underlying issues of waste, inefficiency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10306)|
| 2:51:51| and bloated bureaucracy within city government, we further erode public trust and confidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10311)|
| 2:51:56| in our elected officials and perpetuate a cycle of disenchantment and apathy among our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10316)|
| 2:52:01| constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10321)|
| 2:52:12| Where was I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10332)|
| 2:52:14| Furthermore, it is essential to recognize the regressive nature of this taxation and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10334)|
| 2:52:19| its disproportionate impact on low-income and marginalized communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10339)|
| 2:52:23| For many residents of Knoxville, especially those living on fixed incomes or struggling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10343)|
| 2:52:27| to make ends meet, any increase in property taxes represents a significant financial burden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10347)|
| 2:52:33| that may force them to choose between paying for basic necessities like food, health care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10353)|
| 2:52:37| and housing, or paying for their taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10357)|
| 2:52:39| We cannot in good conscience place such a heavy burden on those who can least afford it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10359)|
| 2:52:45| Additionally, the proposed tax increase fails to address the root causes of the city's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10365)|
| 2:52:50| financial challenges and instead relies on a Band-Aid solution that will only serve to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10370)|
| 2:52:55| exacerbate existing inequalities and hardships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10375)|
| 2:52:58| How about, rather than resorting to quick fixes that place the burden on taxpayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10378)|
| 2:53:02| we prioritize comprehensive reforms that address inefficiencies, streamline operations, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10382)|
| 2:53:08| ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent responsibly and effectively?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10388)|
| 2:53:12| Moreover, it is worth noting that the burden of taxation falls disproportionately on homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10392)|
| 2:53:17| and property owners, while large corporations and wealthy individuals often exploit tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10397)|
| 2:53:22| loopholes and exemptions to avoid paying their fair share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10402)|
| 2:53:25| Rather than burdening ordinary citizens with additional taxes, we must demand that corporations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10405)|
| 2:53:30| and the wealthy contribute their fair share to the upkeep of our city and the provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10410)|
| 2:53:35| of essential services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10415)|
| 2:53:36| In conclusion, I urge each and every one of you to reject Ordinance 12B and demand accountability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10416)|
| 2:53:44| transparency, and responsible stewardship of taxpayer dollars from our city officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10424)|
| 2:53:49| The citizens of Knoxville should not be forced to shoulder the burden of the city's financial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10429)|
| 2:53:54| mismanagement and poor budgeting decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10434)|
| 2:53:57| It is time for our elected officials to prioritize the needs of the people over the interests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10437)|
| 2:54:02| of special interest groups and corporate entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10442)|
| 2:54:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10446)|

| 2:54:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10448)|

| 2:54:15| Mr. Evans, will you confirm for me that the tax rate that we are voting on is the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10455)|
| 2:54:23| tax rate that we have had?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10463)|
| 2:54:26| The last two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10466)|

| 2:54:36| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10476)|
| 2:54:36| And can you also confirm that the source of revenue for the city, unlike the federal government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10476)|
| 2:54:45| we do not get income tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10485)|
| 2:54:47| Our revenue sources are property tax and sales tax revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10487)|
| 2:54:52| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10492)|

| 2:54:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10497)|

| 2:56:13| Ladies and gentlemen, I come, today I come before you to discuss the importance of Ordinance 12C,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10573)|
| 2:56:19| which means to amend Chapter 2, Article 3, Division 2, Section 2-49, 2-450, and 2-458,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10579)|

| 2:56:37| workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10597)|

| 2:56:44| employees for their hard work and commitment, we must also acknowledge the pressing reality that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10604)|
| 2:56:49| thousands of Knoxvillians are facing a cost of living crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10609)|
| 2:56:53| Therefore, as we consider this ordinance, it is imperative that not only do we provide the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10613)|
| 2:57:00| needs of our city workers, but also advocate for measures that support non-city workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10620)|
| 2:57:04| who are struggling to make ends meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10624)|
| 2:57:08| First and foremost, paying our city workers fair wages is not just a matter of fairness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10628)|
| 2:57:13| it is a matter of justice and respect for their contributions to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10633)|
| 2:57:17| Our city employees work tirelessly to provide essential services, maintain public infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10637)|
| 2:57:24| and ensure the safety and well-being of our residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10644)|

| 2:57:41| Moreover, raising the issue of the cost of living crisis facing thousands of Knoxvillians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10661)|
| 2:57:47| is essential as we consider this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10667)|
| 2:57:50| While we recognize the importance of paying our city workers competitive wages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10670)|

| 3:20:38| I was going to start this statement off with good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12038)|
| 3:20:42| I probably should change that to good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12042)|
| 3:20:44| My name is Clay Collins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12044)|
| 3:20:46| I've been a firefighter for 19 years with the City of Knoxville Fire Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12046)|
| 3:20:50| The reason I'm here today is because many firefighters don't agree with the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12050)|
| 3:20:54| proposal due to the unequal investment into our public safety departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12054)|
| 3:21:00| During the course of the last budget year, we saw increases in call volumes along with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12060)|
| 3:21:05| the unprecedented ambulance response times, which led to extreme on-scene wait times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12065)|
| 3:21:11| accompanied by never-before-seen amounts of mandatory overtime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12071)|
| 3:21:15| just to cover shifts due to staffing shortages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12075)|
| 3:21:20| This led to burnout and low morale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12080)|
| 3:21:23| Better opportunities for jobs in the emergency services with higher wages and benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12083)|
| 3:21:28| resulted in 15 firefighters resigning during the budget year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12088)|
| 3:21:32| Sadly, we expect more to leave even before the new budget is implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12092)|
| 3:21:38| Without better pay and compensation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12098)|
| 3:21:41| the department will continue to struggle with recruitment and retention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12101)|
| 3:21:46| Even with all this adversity, the men and women of KFD still showed up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12106)|
| 3:21:50| put on their firefighting boots, and answered a call for service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12110)|
| 3:21:54| We respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12114)|
| 3:21:56| We respond early in the morning, in the middle of the night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12116)|
| 3:21:59| We respond to alarms, accidents, EMS calls, fire, and anything else you might call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12119)|
| 3:22:06| 911 to need help with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12126)|
| 3:22:08| We respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12128)|
| 3:22:09| We work 48 and even 72 hours in a row due to mandatory overtime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12129)|
| 3:22:14| In some cases, we work six 24-hour shifts straight to serve the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12134)|
| 3:22:19| We missed holidays, time with our family, and even time to decompress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12139)|
| 3:22:25| as we continue to serve the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12145)|
| 3:22:28| The 2024-2025 budget has been set and cannot be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12148)|
| 3:22:33| That being said, the first step to solving any problem is recognizing there is a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12153)|
| 3:22:42| Now that we recognize there is a problem, I suggest we go boldly in our solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12162)|
| 3:22:47| In the 2025-2026 budget, the public safety department should have paid parity between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12167)|
| 3:22:53| both departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12173)|
| 3:22:54| You may ask, what does that look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12174)|
| 3:22:57| The answer is more simple than what you think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12177)|
| 3:22:59| If a KPD has a recruit starting at $51,000, KFD should have a recruit starting at $51,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12179)|
| 3:23:09| When the recruit becomes a firefighter, the pay should be $56,885, the same as when a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12189)|
| 3:23:16| recruit becomes a police officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12196)|
| 3:23:18| And as they progress using the same structure as the police department pay grades, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12198)|
| 3:23:23| will solve two problems immediately, by increasing recruitment and retention rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12203)|
| 3:23:28| By doing this, Knoxville will become a shining example of how public safety should be valued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12208)|
| 3:23:32| for others to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12212)|
| 3:23:34| We are a city of leaders, not followers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12214)|

| 3:24:35| First off, at the park meeting last Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12275)|
| 3:24:41| um, during our public forum time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12281)|
| 3:24:49| we had questions, several of us had questions for Chief Noel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12289)|
| 3:24:53| And he was surprised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12293)|
| 3:24:56| I mean, he's expressed it pretty much early on after he was hired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12296)|
| 3:25:03| He actually, it was a funny thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12303)|
| 3:25:07| He turned to some, I guess it was another officer or whatever, and he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12307)|
| 3:25:11| what the hell is this with this public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12311)|
| 3:25:17| Okay, that's your hire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12317)|
| 3:25:19| Now, it's not anything personal against Chief Noel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12319)|
| 3:25:23| but he basically repeated the same sentiment Thursday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12323)|
| 3:25:28| when I asked him some questions about what happened about five, what, four weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12328)|

| 3:26:01| As a reminder, Mr. Roach, public forum is a one-way thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12361)|
| 3:26:05| It's not a dialogue, it's a monologue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12365)|
| 3:26:06| Well, that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12366)|
| 3:26:07| It's a good thing because your silence speaks volumes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12367)|
| 3:26:10| You have three minutes and 18 seconds left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12370)|

| 3:26:27| That city council meeting with the empty balcony, I asked Chief Noel on the break as he stood there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12387)|
| 3:26:36| and he said, can't talk to you right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12396)|
| 3:26:38| I'm watching the people walk out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12398)|
| 3:26:42| Because I asked him the question of, who ordered the balcony shut down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12402)|
| 3:26:50| When I asked him, who ordered the balcony shut down, he said, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12410)|
| 3:26:55| When I was kept out in the lobby and I was scheduled to speak on four different ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12415)|
| 3:27:03| on second reading, I was excluded from doing that because the order had been changed and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12423)|
| 3:27:09| I guess there was a consent agenda passed all of a sudden because in anticipation of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12429)|
| 3:27:18| the all the interested people in the crowd and y'all knew y'all weren't going to do anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12438)|
| 3:27:25| in the first damn place, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12445)|
| 3:27:29| Because none of you had the guts to second the resolution, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12449)|
| 3:27:36| Yeah, you can shake your head financially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12456)|
| 3:27:37| You can shake your head all you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12457)|
| 3:27:38| I don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12458)|
| 3:27:39| This is my public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12459)|
| 3:27:40| I like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12460)|
| 3:27:44| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12464)|
| 3:27:44| Let's be real here, people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12464)|

| 3:27:57| See, I'm coming from my own experience as a native Knoxvillian who has watched changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12477)|
| 3:28:06| happen over and over again and for particular communities, it's still the same stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12486)|
| 3:28:12| And I'm going to keep saying this until it sinks in, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12492)|
| 3:28:18| We've got debates going on about whether or not $42 million should be considered as part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12498)|

| 3:28:30| I call it restoration funds, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12510)|
| 3:28:33| We can't even say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12513)|
| 3:28:34| We can't even say that because y'all don't want to deal with the history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12514)|
| 3:28:39| Y'all don't want to deal with the history and how it connects directly into today, what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12519)|
| 3:28:45| going on today, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12525)|
| 3:28:51| Y'all know me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12531)|

| 3:29:01| And I've watched things come and go and people be ill-served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12541)|
| 3:29:05| And it's getting, it is getting old, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12545)|
| 3:29:10| Because some of y'all are getting paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12550)|
| 3:29:12| I'm going to say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12552)|
| 3:29:13| Some of y'all are getting paid, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12553)|
| 3:29:18| Because nothing's happening for the people that need it the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12558)|
| 3:29:22| That's where you should be focusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12562)|
| 3:29:26| Bye-bye, Ms. Ruth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12566)|

| 3:29:49| You might not know it, but there is a problem with the way that I talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12589)|
| 3:29:54| By now, you might not know it, but there is a pretty easy way to get me and my comrades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12594)|
| 3:30:01| to stop showing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12601)|
| 3:30:03| All you have to do is pass a symbolic permanent ceasefire resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12603)|
| 3:30:10| Now, now, now, now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12610)|
| 3:30:12| I know your tricks by now, City Council and Mayor Kincannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12612)|
| 3:30:16| I know that you believe that Knoxville does not have a foreign policy and that belief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12616)|

| 3:30:31| Don't you think it's ironic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12631)|
| 3:30:32| No, hypocritical that you would say Knoxville doesn't have a foreign policy after directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12632)|
| 3:30:39| taking action in, you guessed it, foreign affairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12639)|
| 3:30:45| If we can have a mayor take part in foreign affairs once, why can't we have it again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12645)|
| 3:30:51| Especially when the people are demanding it this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12651)|
| 3:30:54| Is it because you're scared?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12654)|
| 3:30:57| Seema, I know you said that you were scared after March 16th, which again, I find very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12657)|
| 3:31:02| ironic because for me and everyone here, we have never felt safer than when we were in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12662)|
| 3:31:08| the presence of our Palestinian brothers and sisters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12668)|

| 3:31:16| You want to know why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12676)|
| 3:31:18| It's because we stand together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12678)|
| 3:31:21| We know right from wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12681)|

| 3:31:26| We know that at the end of the day, we have each other's backs, that we are in this struggle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12686)|
| 3:31:31| together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12691)|
| 3:31:33| So if you really felt scared on March 16th up until now, I want you to take a moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12693)|
| 3:31:40| to think of why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12700)|

| 3:31:49| Are you scared of what will happen when the people realize that power, that you'll be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12709)|
| 3:31:54| voted out of office, that you will face public shame and ridicule, that your lives will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12714)|
| 3:31:59| forever changed because you refuse to stand with those who needed it most?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12719)|

| 3:32:22| you truly do not give one singular damn about what the community has to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12742)|
| 3:32:29| For example, last time we met, Tommy, you had the opportunity to allow more speakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12749)|
| 3:32:36| at public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12756)|

| 3:32:39| You silenced ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12759)|
| 3:32:42| Then you blamed it on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12762)|
| 3:32:44| Instead of looking inward and asking yourself, hmm, why did I do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12764)|
| 3:32:50| I represent these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12770)|

| 3:32:57| That, above all else, has proven to me, my comrades, and the community that you would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12777)|
| 3:33:05| rather blame the community's outcry for justice than take the blame yourself for your actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12785)|
| 3:33:11| You would rather not have to listen to our demands than take responsibility for the voices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=12791)|
