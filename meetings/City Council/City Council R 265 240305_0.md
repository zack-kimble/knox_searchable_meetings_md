| 0:07:33| council meeting, that SEMA had made a motion for the owner to still also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=453)|
| 0:07:42| occupy the property, if that is in this amendment that you're signing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=462)|
| 0:07:46| or going to approve tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=466)|
| 0:07:51| Yeah, the short answer is yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=471)|

| 0:08:00| Next person signed up to speak in favor of this is Arbentley Marlowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=480)|
| 0:08:04| Mr. Marlowe, are you present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=484)|
| 0:08:09| Anybody see Mr. Marlowe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=489)|
| 0:08:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=492)|
| 0:08:13| Next is Parker Bartholomew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=493)|
| 0:08:15| Mr. Bartholomew, are you present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=495)|
| 0:08:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=497)|
| 0:08:18| If you could come to the podium, state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=498)|
| 0:08:20| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=500)|
| 0:08:29| Parker Bartholomew, 5406 Summit Ridge, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=509)|
| 0:08:33| Two weeks ago, everyone said that they want to help renters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=513)|
| 0:08:36| But somehow they also said that we need to prevent investors from creating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=516)|
| 0:08:39| housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=519)|
| 0:08:41| How do you expect to help renters when you're preventing to increase the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=521)|
| 0:08:45| supply?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=525)|
| 0:08:46| By the very definition of a renter, it also means that there's a landlord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=526)|
| 0:08:50| We cannot punish landlords while at the same time punishing renters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=530)|
| 0:08:54| while without the same time punishing renters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=534)|
| 0:08:56| It was said that we do not want investors to own all of our housing in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=536)|
| 0:09:00| Knoxville, and we cannot allow ADUs to be built by non-owner occupants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=540)|
| 0:09:05| It was also said that ADUs will not be affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=545)|
| 0:09:08| Let's see what the data says and not the fear-mongering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=548)|
| 0:09:11| In 2018, following legislative changes at the state level which permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=551)|
| 0:09:14| ADUs by right and eliminated the owner occupancy requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=554)|
| 0:09:19| a study was done in California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=559)|
| 0:09:24| It found that most of the ADUs, 41% were completed at homes valued over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=564)|
| 0:09:28| $775,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=568)|
| 0:09:31| High-end neighborhoods, the ones that we're trying to protect or saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=571)|
| 0:09:35| that we're trying to protect, did not think that it lowered their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=575)|
| 0:09:38| values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=578)|
| 0:09:40| 41% were rented at either low or low to middle rental rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=580)|
| 0:09:45| Only 28% were rented for high rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=585)|
| 0:09:48| They did provide an affordable housing option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=588)|
| 0:09:52| In California, 17% of single-family homes are owned by companies or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=592)|
| 0:09:57| evil investors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=597)|
| 0:09:59| Only 8% of ADUs are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=599)|
| 0:10:02| So the fear of investors taking over because ADUs is not justified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=602)|
| 0:10:06| So the data shows that ADUs do not drop home values, are rented for lower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=606)|
| 0:10:11| rates, and do not create a rush of institutional buyers that push out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=611)|
| 0:10:15| locals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=615)|
| 0:10:17| New homes or apartments cannot come close to the low cost of ADUs per unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=617)|
| 0:10:22| There is not a single family house in Knox County that's under $250,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=622)|
| 0:10:27| that's for sale that's a new construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=627)|
| 0:10:29| One-bedroom apartments cost over $400,000 to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=629)|
| 0:10:33| That includes free land and $30,000 from our affordable rental program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=633)|
| 0:10:38| Over half of our city rents and most of them cost burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=638)|
| 0:10:42| There's no way to limit the supply of homes and not be pro-renters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=642)|
| 0:10:47| ADUs can cost as little as $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=647)|
| 0:10:54| I'd love to show you, but I'm not allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=654)|
| 0:10:56| I can literally create housing that would be rented for $500 per month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=656)|
| 0:11:00| but you all will not allow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=660)|
| 0:11:02| Believe it or not, there's homes that are being built in Tennessee right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=662)|
| 0:11:05| that will cost less than half that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=665)|
| 0:11:07| Yes, $25,000 for the same amount of money that is spent per door on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=667)|
| 0:11:12| affordable rental program, you could buy an entire house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=672)|
| 0:11:15| There are churches and non-profits in town that want to build ADUs to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=675)|
| 0:11:19| provide housing to all types of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=679)|
| 0:11:21| They're not allowed to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=681)|
| 0:11:23| Why are we not allowing those folks to provide the most cost-effective housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=683)|
| 0:11:28| Our zoning and building code is the number one reason for lack of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=688)|
| 0:11:31| affordable housing in this city, and it's something that you all in this room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=691)|
| 0:11:34| can change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=694)|
| 0:11:35| It's 100% in your hands to fix, and for some reason, we're not doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=695)|
| 0:11:40| Right now, ordinances are being enforced that are against state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=700)|
| 0:11:44| Ordinances like owner occupancy requirements skirt the Fair Housing Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=704)|
| 0:11:48| A pattern can be shown that we go out of our way to prevent affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=708)|
| 0:11:52| From how we calculate a family to the number of bedrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=712)|
| 0:11:57| owner occupancy requirements, fire protection interpretations, easements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=717)|
| 0:12:02| stormwater requirements, energy code interpretations, rights-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=722)|
| 0:12:06| word maps, tax freezes, congregate living, and many more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=726)|
| 0:12:10| All of these are directly in your all's purview, and all of them increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=730)|
| 0:12:14| the cost of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=734)|
| 0:12:15| Tonight, you have the opportunity to remove the owner occupancy requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=735)|
| 0:12:19| A vote that leaves the owner occupancy requirement in place is a vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=739)|
| 0:12:22| for housing discrimination and against any hope of affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=742)|
| 0:12:26| in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=746)|
| 0:12:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=747)|
| 0:12:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=749)|
| 0:12:31| Mr. Marlow, I see that you've entered the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=751)|
| 0:12:33| Do you still wish to speak on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=753)|
| 0:12:35| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=755)|
| 0:12:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=756)|
| 0:12:37| Please come to the podium, and you'll have up to five minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=757)|
| 0:12:39| to address the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=759)|
| 0:12:43| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=763)|
| 0:12:44| Arbently Marlow, Mechanicsville, 322 Douglas Avenue, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=764)|
| 0:12:50| So, yeah, so this is before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=770)|
| 0:12:53| This started using the procedures that you or previous councils| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=773)|
| 0:12:57| approved in recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=777)|
| 0:12:59| I think from discussion last meeting, it's a bit unfair to say that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=779)|
| 0:13:03| is a non-proper channel or an improper way to present a zoning change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=783)|
| 0:13:07| because previous councils saw fit to include this very mechanism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=787)|
| 0:13:11| Not only did I follow the rules of the mechanism and pay the fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=791)|
| 0:13:14| planning violated those rules by sidestepping not this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=794)|
| 0:13:19| but some of the other ones, and then it came here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=799)|
| 0:13:21| and then I requested that they all be sent back, which they were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=801)|
| 0:13:24| and then they had a second bite at the apple,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=804)|
| 0:13:26| and planning once again saw fit to bring this to you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=806)|
| 0:13:30| as a proposed ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=810)|
| 0:13:32| I believe that is twice now that planning has indicated that this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=812)|
| 0:13:37| what they believe in their expertise, which is planning and land use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=817)|
| 0:13:40| to be the appropriate way forward, and specifically that is to remove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=820)|
| 0:13:44| the owner-occupied restriction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=824)|
| 0:13:47| I have no doubt that Mr. Parker's history lesson from last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=827)|
| 0:13:51| was reiterated again this week, and a lot of the opposition we're hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=831)|
| 0:13:55| is coming from a select few neighborhoods in Mr. Roberto's district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=835)|
| 0:13:59| the second district, the most affluent district in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=839)|
| 0:14:03| I'm unaware that they're here tonight, but I just got here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=843)|
| 0:14:06| so they may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=846)|
| 0:14:09| But I think that it's something that should give pause to all of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=849)|
| 0:14:13| that in a city that's 52% renters, that from the observations of last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=853)|
| 0:14:20| three neighborhoods each sent one representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=860)|
| 0:14:23| and basically they advocated based on fear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=863)|
| 0:14:27| and fear that professional data does not support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=867)|
| 0:14:30| Our own Optico's report, the expert that we chose, we hired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=870)|
| 0:14:34| does not support the fears that they're espousing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=874)|
| 0:14:38| It seems very similar, like Mr. Bartholomew said last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=878)|
| 0:14:42| It sounds a lot like the fears that were based in the pigmentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=882)|
| 0:14:45| and coloring of skin 60 to 75 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=885)|
| 0:14:48| And I think enough is enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=888)|
| 0:14:50| I think we've moved on, and I think we need to leave those days in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| They are the darkest days of some of our history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=893)|
| 0:14:56| particularly our most recent history, post-World War II,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=896)|
| 0:14:58| and it's time for that to end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=898)|
| 0:15:00| We need to be ruling and making decisions for this city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=900)|
| 0:15:03| based on the best interest of all of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=903)|
| 0:15:05| not select few neighborhoods that have the most wealthy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=905)|
| 0:15:09| and homogeneous makeup of the entire city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=909)|
| 0:15:12| So I would urge you to reconsider putting back in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=912)|
| 0:15:16| as planning has now suggested twice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=916)|
| 0:15:18| removing the owner-occupied restriction to the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=918)|
| 0:15:22| And I also believe that we should seriously call it what it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=922)|
| 0:15:26| that this is not an inappropriate mechanism to bring it before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=926)|
| 0:15:29| There was nothing short-sighted or short-circuiting public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=929)|
| 0:15:33| I paid the fee, followed the rules that some of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=933)|
| 0:15:37| and certainly prior council during recode enacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=937)|
| 0:15:40| So here I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=940)|
| 0:15:42| I think it should be an up or down vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=942)|
| 0:15:45| and I look forward to further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=945)|
| 0:15:47| But I remind you, all of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=947)|
| 0:15:49| that the future of housing requires reforming our zoning code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=949)|
| 0:15:53| and that is done by the nine of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=953)|
| 0:15:56| It does not require the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=956)|
| 0:15:58| It does not require public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| It does not require public referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=960)|
| 0:16:02| It requires the vote, and vote your conscience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=962)|
| 0:16:04| each and every one of the nine of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=964)|
| 0:16:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=966)|
| 0:16:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=969)|
| 0:16:10| Council members, that concludes the people signed up to speak to Item 9B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=973)|
| 0:16:21| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=981)|
| 0:16:25| I just wanted to speak to a couple of the comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=985)|
| 0:16:27| that were shared tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=987)|
| 0:16:33| And I did not come prepared to do a full history lesson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=993)|
| 0:16:36| but what keeps being shared conflicts with my own understanding of history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=996)|
| 0:16:50| As for me, when I am thinking about zoning changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1010)|
| 0:16:56| especially broad zoning changes in our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1016)|
| 0:17:02| and we are looking at making changes to increase affordable housing in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1022)|
| 0:17:15| However, the tools and the strategies that we are contemplating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1035)|
| 0:17:22| we will fully admit will likely produce housing that does not serve the working class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1042)|
| 0:17:33| that we are saying that we are changing these policies for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1053)|
| 0:17:39| And in my experience, you must put forward policies that have a specific intent behind them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1059)|
| 0:17:57| And if we are putting policies forward that do not produce affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1077)|
| 0:18:03| then we have to recognize what are going to be the consequences of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1083)|
| 0:18:07| and how do we then respond to these new conditions that we have created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1087)|
| 0:18:17| When I think about urban removal and the policies that were put into place then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1097)|
| 0:18:25| a lot of the arguments that were being made at the time were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1105)|
| 0:18:31| these are substandard housing, the plumbing is not up to code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1111)|
| 0:18:37| and everyone deserves to live in quality housing of a good standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1117)|
| 0:18:45| And so housing was taken away from folks, we can say purchased, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1125)|
| 0:18:51| and folks were moved into public housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1131)|
| 0:18:55| And so I take issue with how it seems like my community specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1135)|
| 0:19:03| continues to be used as an excuse for policy changes that we admit aren't going to benefit them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1143)|
| 0:19:13| most likely aren't going to benefit them, at least in the immediate, maybe at some point down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1153)|
| 0:19:21| I take offense to that, as my community continues to be used to justify policies that are not designed to help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1161)|
| 0:19:31| And in fact, we've talked about naturally occurring affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1171)|
| 0:19:39| We're making a lot of these zoning changes and seeing new development and activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1179)|
| 0:19:45| in lower income neighborhoods where we do have this naturally occurring affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1185)|
| 0:19:51| where for at least the last few generations, poor parts of our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1191)|
| 0:20:01| were able to find a house and become a homeowner in neighborhoods that were less desirable than other parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1201)|
| 0:20:12| Now we're going into those very neighborhoods and making zoning changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1212)|
| 0:20:18| that could push these folks out of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1218)|
| 0:20:24| I am open to a longer discussion about some of these zoning changes, including owner-occupied ADUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1224)|
| 0:20:37| But unfortunately, what's come before us hasn't been put through that rigor that I would appreciate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1237)|
| 0:20:50| And so I'm not able to support it because we're not thinking about the unintended consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1250)|
| 0:20:56| We're not thinking about how this will impact our naturally occurring affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1256)|
| 0:21:03| and the ability of individuals in our community to eventually become homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1263)|
| 0:21:08| When we started a lot of these conversations four or five years ago, at least on this council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1268)|
| 0:21:14| others on council have been having these conversations long before me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1274)|
| 0:21:18| we were talking about the wealth gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| We were talking about the lack of homeownership in the African-American community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| We were talking about all these issues that deserved a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1284)|
| 0:21:28| But what we focused on is how to bring more market-rate housing into our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1288)|
| 0:21:35| Councilmember Parker, I'll come back to you after some of your other colleagues have had a chance to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1295)|
| 0:21:42| Councilmember McKendry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1302)|
| 0:21:45| Thank you, Mary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1305)|
| 0:21:46| Just well said to this point, Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1306)|
| 0:21:51| But I do want to be really clear that it's just not members of the affluent neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1311)|
| 0:21:56| who are concerned about owner-occupied ADUs and what that could potentially look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1316)|
| 0:22:03| There are people who are in other parts of the community, up to and including parts of my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1323)|
| 0:22:10| who are very much concerned about what that would look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1330)|
| 0:22:13| and some of the consequences that could result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1333)|
| 0:22:18| Those folks don't always have the luxury to be able to come down to council meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1338)|
| 0:22:22| and to sign up and speak at public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1342)|
| 0:22:24| and therefore they look to those of us that sit around this table every other week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1344)|
| 0:22:31| to be able to advocate and to speak on their behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1351)|
| 0:22:34| And so as we sit here and we listen to some of the things that are said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1354)|
| 0:22:40| some things seem to cross the line a little bit as it relates to some comments this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1360)|
| 0:22:47| And so I just want to be clear that, yes, folks who are in more affluent communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1367)|
| 0:22:53| have the ability to be able to come to the meetings and to speak out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1373)|
| 0:22:56| but please do not take that as if homeowners and residents in other parts of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1376)|
| 0:23:03| that are not as affluent don't have opinions and don't look to us to be able to speak on their behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1383)|
| 0:23:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1389)|
| 0:23:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1391)|
| 0:23:12| Councilmember Ryder and then Councilmember Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1392)|
| 0:23:16| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1396)|
| 0:23:18| Yeah, I just want to confirm what my colleague, Councilperson McKenzie, just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1398)|
| 0:23:24| In my district, of course, we have people of all levels of incomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1404)|
| 0:23:27| but we also have some of the lower-income neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1407)|
| 0:23:31| and I have gotten extreme strong opposition to removing these requirements in my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1411)|
| 0:23:40| So it's not an affluent versus lower-income issue at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1420)|
| 0:23:46| So I just wanted to say that I'm having the same experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1426)|
| 0:23:51| and getting the same feedback that my colleague is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1431)|
| 0:23:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1436)|
| 0:23:57| Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1437)|
| 0:23:58| Yeah, I would say that while many of the facts that Mr. Bartholomew shared with us I do agree with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1438)|
| 0:24:10| there were a couple of other things that were said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| Mr. Marlowe, specifically, you made comments about the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1452)|
| 0:24:18| and how the ability to pay to have something heard was part of the recode process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1458)|
| 0:24:23| and that is factually true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1463)|
| 0:24:26| And there were a couple of comments about the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1466)|
| 0:24:29| So I think it needs to be clarified that there is the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1469)|
| 0:24:34| formerly known as MPC, the staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1474)|
| 0:24:38| and then there's the planning commissioners who vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1478)|
| 0:24:42| The planning staff recommendation was not to reverse owner-occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1482)|
| 0:24:49| I'm not commenting on my own feelings about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1489)|
| 0:24:51| I'm just saying that that was one piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1491)|
| 0:24:53| And then the planning commissioners chose to remove that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1493)|
| 0:24:57| That was their vote, and it was a very split vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1497)|
| 0:25:00| I think for public record it needs to be noted that that was not widely unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1500)|
| 0:25:09| It was quite the split vote, and there were members that were not present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1509)|
| 0:25:13| that would have voted the other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1513)|
| 0:25:15| It was a tight margin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1515)|
| 0:25:17| And one thing that I think distinctly needs to be noted is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1517)|
| 0:25:23| when missing middle housing came through planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1523)|
| 0:25:28| the planning commissioners, not to be confused with the planning staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1528)|
| 0:25:33| specifically put a pause and postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1533)|
| 0:25:36| and gave the city administration the directive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1536)|
| 0:25:40| to take missing middle housing back out to the neighborhoods for additional input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1540)|
| 0:25:45| and go make round-robin meetings with our neighborhood groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1545)|
| 0:25:50| So one of the comments that you made, Mr. Marlowe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1550)|
| 0:25:54| was that we need to make the decision that our heart tells us to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1554)|
| 0:25:57| and we don't need to include public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1557)|
| 0:26:00| I may not agree with all the public input that I have that I receive on any side of an issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1560)|
| 0:26:07| but I take offense at the I don't need to consider public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1567)|
| 0:26:12| So I hope that maybe I've misunderstood what you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1572)|
| 0:26:17| but I think that for the public record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| and I believe that is what some of my colleagues are saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1579)|
| 0:26:22| is the public input that we are getting is not necessarily from one neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1582)|
| 0:26:28| Missing middle housing, even though that was controversy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1588)|
| 0:26:31| and there were plenty of neighborhoods that were not okay with that change as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1591)|
| 0:26:35| there was input that was in opposition to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1595)|
| 0:26:38| It still passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1598)|
| 0:26:39| It was shopped around and spoken to at length with neighborhoods per the commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1599)|
| 0:26:46| who apparently didn't think that this component needed to be gone out to the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1606)|
| 0:26:51| So juxtaposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1611)|
| 0:26:55| I'm going to stick with what we passed last time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1615)|
| 0:26:57| and stick with the same vote that I had last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1617)|
| 0:27:00| I think that if in the future we decide this needs to be looked at and studied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1620)|
| 0:27:05| I believe that's what we said in the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1625)|
| 0:27:07| We talked about with or there were comments to Miss Brooks or to city staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1627)|
| 0:27:12| about looking at and doing a better review of what other cities do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1632)|
| 0:27:17| The majority of cities do require owner-occupied with ADUs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1637)|
| 0:27:22| although I will point out that owner-occupied with ADUs is not a whole lot different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1642)|
| 0:27:29| when at this moment you can do a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1649)|
| 0:27:32| So don't do an ADU. Do a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1652)|
| 0:27:35| Get a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1655)|
| 0:27:36| It's not a whole lot different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1656)|
| 0:27:39| I also have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| Number one, because we just don't have a mechanism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1661)|
| 0:27:44| there's no deed restrictions tied to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1664)|
| 0:27:47| for city staff to be monitoring who lives in the houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1667)|
| 0:27:53| and at what point they're sold, who lives in the houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1673)|
| 0:27:57| That is something that we haven't mastered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1677)|
| 0:28:03| and we haven't built into the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1683)|
| 0:28:06| And just for levity and facts, on a closing comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1686)|
| 0:28:13| I'll point out that in Australia they refer to these as Fonzie Flats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1693)|
| 0:28:18| because, if everyone remembers, the Cunninghams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1698)|
| 0:28:21| they were worried that their hardware store was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1701)|
| 0:28:23| apparently they hit rough times and they needed additional revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1703)|
| 0:28:26| And so they built an apartment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| and there was apparently an older lady that they were going to rent to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1708)|
| 0:28:31| and I believe she had difficulty with the stairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1711)|
| 0:28:33| or had a reason that she couldn't go up to the garage apartment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| That was Fonzie's mother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| It didn't work for her, so she said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1718)|
| 0:28:40| how about you rent to my son, Fonzie, and then, you know, there you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1720)|
| 0:28:44| In looking this up, there were a lot of TV shows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1724)|
| 0:28:48| where there was some element of somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1728)|
| 0:28:51| living in a garage apartment carriage house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1731)|
| 0:28:54| So there's my piece of levity to tack on to all our commentary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1734)|
| 0:28:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1738)|
| 0:28:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1739)|
| 0:29:00| Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| Thank you, Mayor, and I just want to thank my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1742)|
| 0:29:05| for their comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1745)|
| 0:29:09| You know, we certainly heard from a variety of neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| in our emails, not just the 2nd District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1751)|
| 0:29:15| and I appreciate all of you talking about that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1755)|
| 0:29:19| This is not about, you know, one neighborhood or a few neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1759)|
| 0:29:26| It's about, you know, people who own their homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| and are concerned about what unintended consequences might come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1768)|
| 0:29:33| I do also appreciate the pushback on attempts at making things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1773)|
| 0:29:41| about, you know, owners versus renters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1781)|
| 0:29:45| and this part of the town versus that part of the town of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1785)|
| 0:29:50| because I don't think that's helpful in trying to solve problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1790)|
| 0:29:53| and I appreciate all of you chiming in to that effect as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1793)|
| 0:30:00| I wanted to also address what Ms. Phillips, who came from Norwood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1800)|
| 0:30:06| had to say about when she came earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1806)|
| 0:30:10| And, yes, just like the Mayor said, just so everyone's clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1810)|
| 0:30:15| owner occupancy is still in what's being considered to be voted for today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1815)|
| 0:30:19| The language that's in there says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1819)|
| 0:30:21| one of the dwelling units must be occupied by the owner of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1821)|
| 0:30:25| That language is still in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1825)|
| 0:30:27| so passage of this on second reading maintains owner occupancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1827)|
| 0:30:33| just so it's clear for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1833)|
| 0:30:36| The other part that I just wanted to mention, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| is there are mechanisms for having additional units on a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1838)|
| 0:30:46| in an R and 1 or an R and 2, and that's doing a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1846)|
| 0:30:51| And that you can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1851)|
| 0:30:53| You have to go through and collect public input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| and we have a public process called the special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1856)|
| 0:30:59| That's how that goes through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1859)|
| 0:31:01| ADUs don't have a special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1861)|
| 0:31:04| It's a use by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1864)|
| 0:31:06| So that means that you can just get a permit and build it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1866)|
| 0:31:10| There's no public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1870)|
| 0:31:12| And so I thought the comments about public input were particularly important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1872)|
| 0:31:16| because I think it is important to have public input on those kinds of decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1876)|
| 0:31:22| So there are differences between ADUs and other types of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1882)|
| 0:31:27| and I think this council is taking action to preserve this protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1887)|
| 0:31:32| because I think you can go talk to any realtor right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1892)|
| 0:31:35| and they'll tell you they've got 15, 20 investors lined up to buy anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1895)|
| 0:31:39| that goes on the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1899)|
| 0:31:41| And we want to make sure that people can own homes, too, not just investors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1901)|
| 0:31:47| It's not about investors against anyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1907)|
| 0:31:51| It's about making sure that the rules are fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1911)|
| 0:31:54| so that everybody has an opportunity to be an owner if they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1914)|
| 0:31:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1918)|
| 0:32:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1920)|
| 0:32:01| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1921)|
| 0:32:03| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1923)|
| 0:32:06| In our e-mails that we got, especially two weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1926)|
| 0:32:08| and then they've still been dribbling in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1928)|
| 0:32:12| it was from a variety of neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| There were a few neighborhoods that were heavy on the e-mails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1934)|
| 0:32:19| But what I also noticed is that I didn't go through and count,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1939)|
| 0:32:24| but I don't know how many e-mails were from renters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1944)|
| 0:32:28| I think they were all from homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1948)|
| 0:32:30| Not all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1950)|
| 0:32:31| Mostly from homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1951)|
| 0:32:33| So when we're getting public input, we're only getting, what is it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1953)|
| 0:32:37| 53% of the city is renters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1957)|
| 0:32:40| So they're half the people that are not in this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1960)|
| 0:32:44| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1964)|
| 0:32:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1966)|
| 0:32:47| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1967)|
| 0:32:50| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1970)|
| 0:32:53| Just to follow up with what Council Member Singh said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| I think the reason why we're not hearing from renters is because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1978)|
| 0:33:02| they fully believe this conversation isn't about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1982)|
| 0:33:07| They need something today, tomorrow, in the next six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1987)|
| 0:33:13| We're talking about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1993)|
| 0:33:18| changes to zoning that the staff, city staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=1998)|
| 0:33:23| have promised us is a slow drip that's going to happen in neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2003)|
| 0:33:30| That's what the community is hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2010)|
| 0:33:32| We're spending, how long have we been working on these issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2012)|
| 0:33:36| A couple of years to get a slow drip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2016)|
| 0:33:42| So renters are waiting to hear about the windfall, the windfall of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2022)|
| 0:33:48| Not us pat ourselves on the back for continuing to push affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2028)|

| 0:34:03| What I wanted to respond to was the comment about the Opticos report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2043)|
| 0:34:08| and my concerns about some of these changes that we're making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2048)|
| 0:34:12| I believe we've already, as a city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2052)|
| 0:34:16| dipped our toes into middle housing with the South Waterfront,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2056)|
| 0:34:24| with the foreign-based code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| But we've refused, as a city, to evaluate it, as a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2067)|
| 0:34:33| There's a working group looking at foreign-based code, suggesting changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2073)|
| 0:34:40| When I had a conversation about missing middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2080)|
| 0:34:42| there were a couple of lessons learned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2082)|
| 0:34:45| The administrative review process is going to be a little bit different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2085)|
| 0:34:49| But I don't feel comfortable that we are actually following the advice of Opticos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2089)|
| 0:34:58| If we were following the advice of Opticos,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2098)|
| 0:35:00| we would have spent more time reviewing what was done on the South Waterfront| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2100)|
| 0:35:05| and how that's impacted various neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2105)|
| 0:35:10| And there are some people who are happy with what's happened on the South| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2110)|
| 0:35:14| Waterfront, but there are lots who are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2114)|
| 0:35:19| There are good parts of it to me, but, man, there are really bad parts of it to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2119)|
| 0:35:24| Someone who went to South Knoxville Elementary grew up walking up Davenport,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2124)|
| 0:35:28| living on Sherrod Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2128)|
| 0:35:29| That's the neighborhood I grew up in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2129)|
| 0:35:35| And so my preference would be that we learn from situations before we move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2135)|
| 0:35:44| with wide-sweeping policy changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2144)|
| 0:35:49| But I haven't seen us willing to do that, and so that's why I didn't support missing middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2149)|
| 0:35:53| and that's why I'm not willing to support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2153)|
| 0:35:56| I'm actually uncomfortable with some of the changes that we've made to this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2156)|
| 0:36:01| but I'm willing to compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| But not on the owner occupancy, because we haven't discussed it enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2165)|
| 0:36:11| those unintended consequences, and we haven't gone back to our original stated goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2171)|
| 0:36:18| of addressing the affordable housing crisis, of addressing the growing wealth gap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| of addressing the lack of homeownership among certain portions of our population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2182)|
| 0:36:27| Last thing I heard about the homeownership piece was we were going to give some money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2187)|
| 0:36:32| to the Urban League for financial consulting on how to purchase a home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2192)|
| 0:36:39| and I found that so insulting, knowing what market we're in right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2199)|
| 0:36:45| knowing the history of racial discrimination in our housing market in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2205)|
| 0:36:52| and our only focus is on some financial coaching for members of our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2212)|
| 0:36:59| who've been unable to purchase a home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2219)|
| 0:37:03| So I support an incentive program for ADUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2223)|
| 0:37:12| I support very intentional policy changes and programs that work to help us build healthy neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2232)|
| 0:37:23| that aren't majority investment owned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2243)|
| 0:37:28| But I don't support and I don't really appreciate the comments that have been made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2248)|
| 0:37:35| about these decisions being discriminatory, because at least from my perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2255)|
| 0:37:44| I am thinking about those low-income folks, those racial minorities who've been blocked out of the housing market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2264)|
| 0:37:50| and need our support and assistance to address those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2270)|
| 0:37:56| Thank you, Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| Councilmember Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2278)|
| 0:38:00| Yes, just a few brief comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2280)|
| 0:38:02| I haven't said a lot during these discussions, and part of it is because I had pretty much been confirmed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2282)|
| 0:38:08| with my position of the owner occupancy being retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2288)|
| 0:38:15| And it's not because I'm closed-minded or anything, but I've been through this vetting process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2295)|
| 0:38:20| or been through the process of evaluating this before, and the city has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2300)|
| 0:38:24| And it wasn't that too long ago that we had lots of public input, a previous body evaluated this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2304)|
| 0:38:33| and it became pretty much established that owner occupancy was the way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2313)|
| 0:38:41| And I haven't heard anything since then, or my constituents haven't prevailed on me to change my mind in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2321)|
| 0:38:49| So I feel very confident that keeping the owner occupancy has followed all the processes beforehand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2329)|
| 0:38:58| and that it's the right thing to do, and I think it's been vetted by both previous administrations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2338)|
| 0:39:04| our administration, the planning staff, and the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2344)|
| 0:39:08| So I will continue to vote for this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2348)|
| 0:39:13| Vice Mayor Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2353)|
| 0:39:14| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2354)|
| 0:39:15| Just a quick comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2355)|
| 0:39:16| I don't have anything really unique to add, but I'll reiterate the point I made a couple weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2356)|
| 0:39:22| I think it's really important as zoning proposals come before this council in the midst of a housing crisis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2362)|
| 0:39:28| that we don't feel that every policy change carries the burden of the entire housing challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2368)|
| 0:39:36| So rightly or wrongly, a lot of times we're asked to put the whole weight of our housing challenge on one specific vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2376)|
| 0:39:41| as if it's going to solve everything, and I just want to reiterate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2381)|
| 0:39:45| Based on our workshop recently, based on a lot of comments we've all had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2385)|
| 0:39:48| each housing policy fits a need in the housing ecosystem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2388)|
| 0:39:53| One policy doesn't solve them all, and so I just want to refresh that for this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2393)|
| 0:39:59| This council has approved a diverse number of pilots, other zoning changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2399)|
| 0:40:05| and so we've 20-plus zoning or housing-related changes over just the past two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2405)|
| 0:40:13| so I don't think it's on us to take every measure or every vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2413)|
| 0:40:21| and put the blanket weight of the entire housing crisis on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2421)|
| 0:40:24| So I think where we landed last council meeting is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2424)|
| 0:40:27| I think where we are today for this vote is appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2427)|
| 0:40:30| and I'll be supporting this amended version from last week, our last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2430)|
| 0:40:36| Thank you. Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2436)|
| 0:40:39| Vice Mayor, your light is still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2439)|

| 0:43:35| and welcome to the City Council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2615)|
| 0:43:39| You'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2621)|
| 0:43:42| Thank you, members of City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2622)|
| 0:43:44| We're asking for your support to help move Knox County forward by approving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2624)|
| 0:43:48| the proposed Growth Policy Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| In 2021, Knox County started the process to create a new comprehensive land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2630)|
| 0:43:54| use and transportation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| This came after the Growth Policy Committee reconvened in 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2636)|
| 0:44:00| and at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2640)|
| 0:44:01| Knoxville and Farragut leaders asked us to update our general plan to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2641)|
| 0:44:05| the infrastructure concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| In other words, it was suggested that we take a proactive approach rather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2647)|
| 0:44:11| than be reactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| We agreed and also decided to take it a step further and create our first land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2653)|
| 0:44:17| use and transportation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| Knox County in the past had never looked at land use and infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2659)|
| 0:44:23| together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2663)|
| 0:44:24| We then spent the past couple of years holding numerous rounds of public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2664)|
| 0:44:28| meetings and compiling data from our technical committee members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2668)|
| 0:44:32| stakeholders, utility providers, and subcommittees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2672)|
| 0:44:35| all leading to the creation of a future land use map and comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2675)|
| 0:44:40| That data, which helps align infrastructure and land use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2680)|
| 0:44:43| has led to the proposed amendment that is on your agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2683)|
| 0:44:46| We have done a lot of work, but we still have more ahead of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2686)|
| 0:44:50| Your approval of the Growth Policy Plan is simply the first step in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2690)|
| 0:44:54| adoption process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2694)|
| 0:44:55| I would like to refer you to the Knoxville and Knox County Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2695)|
| 0:44:59| Relationship of Plans document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2699)|

| 0:45:04| the plan that determines where growth boundaries are before the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2704)|
| 0:45:09| Commission can approve the future land use map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2709)|
| 0:45:13| The County Commission has already signed off on the Growth Policy Plan in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2713)|
| 0:45:17| unanimous 11-0 vote during their February 26th meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2717)|
| 0:45:21| but it was contingent on the adoption of the comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2721)|
| 0:45:24| This means the Growth Policy Plan will not go into effect until the Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2724)|
| 0:45:28| Commission and the County Commission have approved and adopted the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2728)|
| 0:45:31| comprehensive plan and future land use map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2731)|

| 0:45:50| approving the proposed Growth Policy Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2750)|
| 0:45:53| This will allow us to take the next step in adopting our future land use map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2753)|
| 0:45:57| and comprehensive plan and to create a coordinated approach to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2757)|
| 0:46:00| infrastructure and land use, mindful growth, and a roadmap for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2760)|
| 0:46:05| Thank you for your support. Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2765)|
| 0:46:08| Thank you. Next person in the Senate to speak in favor of this is Amy Nolan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2768)|
| 0:46:24| Thank you, Mayor, members of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2784)|

| 0:46:31| The Knoxville Chamber, as part of per state law, was represented on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2791)|
| 0:46:35| Growth Policy Committee and voted to approve Knox County Mayor Glenn Jacobs'| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2795)|
| 0:46:40| proposed amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2800)|
| 0:46:42| The chamber recognizes that the current guidelines developed more than 20 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2802)|
| 0:46:46| ago have led, in many cases, to sprawling subdivisions that consume green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2806)|
| 0:46:52| space and farmland without the proper roads and commercial hubs to support them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2812)|
| 0:46:58| What is before you tonight is an effort to extend the planned growth area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2818)|
| 0:47:02| which will result in a variety of housing styles not currently possible in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2822)|
| 0:47:06| county and allow less development in the rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2826)|
| 0:47:12| The amendment was developed after two years of meetings of stakeholders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2832)|
| 0:47:17| intergovernmental technical committees, as well as many surveys publicly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2837)|
| 0:47:22| advertised meetings and targeted workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2842)|
| 0:47:25| I think a planning commission today, the county mentioned that they had over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2845)|
| 0:47:29| 5200 touches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2849)|
| 0:47:31| Some of those might have been the same people, but that's how many touches they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2851)|
| 0:47:35| had from surveys, meetings, and the like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2855)|
| 0:47:39| Consultants and staff were left with really two with dueling priorities to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2859)|
| 0:47:45| create more housing and preserve green space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2865)|
| 0:47:49| We believe this amendment strikes that balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2869)|
| 0:47:52| Keeping the status quo is estimated to result in an annual $2 million deficit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2872)|
| 0:47:58| as infrastructure struggles to keep up with sprawl, which is what the current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2878)|
| 0:48:03| plan allows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2883)|
| 0:48:05| This plan would save the county nearly $5 million money that could be used to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2885)|
| 0:48:10| invest in education, infrastructure, and parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2890)|

| 0:48:24| Many more opportunities will exist for the public to engage in the details, to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2904)|
| 0:48:29| advocate for changes in the details, including approval of a comprehensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2909)|
| 0:48:34| future land use map and a unified building code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2914)|
| 0:48:38| Tonight's vote is an important first step to ensuring that Knox County will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2918)|
| 0:48:43| grow with appropriate infrastructure, more variety in housing, and at a cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2923)|
| 0:48:48| that is not burdened for taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2928)|
| 0:48:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2931)|

| 0:49:08| growth policy amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2948)|
| 0:49:10| I do want to first, I think it's always important to preface these conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2950)|
| 0:49:13| with data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2953)|
| 0:49:14| As you all know, housing costs have significantly outpaced incomes over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2954)|
| 0:49:18| past five years, and we're in a situation affordability-wise that's pretty much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2958)|
| 0:49:23| similar to the 1980s when mortgage rates were 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2963)|
| 0:49:27| And it's the most acute crisis we've faced in a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2967)|
| 0:49:31| In 2023, families needed an annual income of over $94,000 to purchase the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2971)|
| 0:49:37| median-priced home, and the median household income in Knox County is just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2977)|
| 0:49:42| $70,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2982)|
| 0:49:44| So as a result, roughly two in three residents in Knox County cannot afford to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2984)|
| 0:49:48| purchase a home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| It's a crisis that's most acute for many of our city's and county's most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2990)|
| 0:49:54| essential workers, and the data really bears this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2994)|
| 0:49:57| The starting salary for a KPD officer, it's enough to afford 2% of the homes on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=2997)|
| 0:50:04| the market on any given day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3004)|
| 0:50:05| So I submit to you what happens when our police officers can't afford to live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3005)|
| 0:50:09| in the community in which they serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3009)|
| 0:50:12| The starting salary for a teacher is, again, enough to afford 2% of homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3012)|
| 0:50:16| So what happens when we don't have enough teachers to teach our kids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3016)|
| 0:50:20| The median salary for a registered nurse, enough to afford 5% of homes on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3020)|
| 0:50:25| market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3025)|
| 0:50:26| And many of us have seen over the last few years firsthand what happens when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3026)|
| 0:50:30| hospital emergency rooms are understaffed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3030)|
| 0:50:32| These are the people who are hurt the worst and the most when we fail to plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3032)|
| 0:50:37| for growth and to assure that our land use policies reflect the current needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3037)|
| 0:50:41| and priorities of our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3041)|
| 0:50:43| And if we are actually to address the housing crisis, we cannot continue to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3043)|
| 0:50:47| rely on plans that are more than 20 years old and reflect the needs and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3047)|
| 0:50:52| priorities of our community from 20 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3052)|
| 0:50:56| It's also important to remember the proposed amendments are a healthy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3056)|
| 0:50:59| compromise intended to promote responsible growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3059)|
| 0:51:03| The first part of that is preserving our county's rural landscape by reducing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3063)|
| 0:51:07| density from three units an acre to two in all of the rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3067)|
| 0:51:12| And, in fact, 93% of the rural areas right now will stay rural and have their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3072)|
| 0:51:19| density reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3079)|
| 0:51:20| And I can assure you that this will be the first and the last time I ever come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3080)|
| 0:51:23| before you and advocate for reducing density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3083)|
| 0:51:27| The amendments, secondly, will work to address our growing housing crisis by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3087)|
| 0:51:32| moving 7% of the land that's currently rural into the planned growth areas and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3092)|
| 0:51:37| expanding development potential in the areas that are well served by existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3097)|
| 0:51:41| infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3101)|
| 0:51:42| These areas, some people say these aren't the right areas, but it's important to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3102)|
| 0:51:47| recognize these are the areas that were identified through a rigorous planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3107)|
| 0:51:50| process that included eight different utility providers, including KUB, TVA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3110)|

| 0:52:01| Together, these changes will discourage sprawl by making it more expensive to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3121)|
| 0:52:05| develop in rural places and less expensive to develop in places where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3125)|
| 0:52:09| infrastructure exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3129)|
| 0:52:11| It's basic economics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3131)|
| 0:52:13| And maybe it might also spur some development on those commercial corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3133)|
| 0:52:17| we've all been talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3137)|
| 0:52:19| We must also remember that these amendments didn't just come out of nowhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3139)|
| 0:52:23| They are the direct result of a rigorous two-year public planning process which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3143)|
| 0:52:28| engaged thousands of city and county residents alike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3148)|
| 0:52:32| And voting to reject the growth plan would amount to council overriding this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3152)|
| 0:52:36| very long and intensive public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3156)|
| 0:52:40| Lastly, it's also important to consider the facts and the reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3160)|
| 0:52:44| Mayor Jacobs has stated publicly that he will not reconvene the Growth Policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3164)|
| 0:52:49| Coordinating Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3169)|
| 0:52:50| So, really, we have one choice tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3170)|
| 0:52:53| It's to vote to approve the growth policy plan as proposed or to reject the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3173)|
| 0:52:58| growth policy plan and force the county to use a 20-year-old growth map that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3178)|
| 0:53:03| represents where we thought growth would occur 20 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3183)|
| 0:53:08| So, remember, those who are asking you to reject the plan or postpone are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3188)|
| 0:53:11| in fact, asking you to force the county to rely on a 20-year-old plan that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3191)|
| 0:53:17| created the problem that we're trying to achieve in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3197)|
| 0:53:21| In other words, rejecting the growth policy plan is tantamount to maintaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3201)|
| 0:53:26| the status quo and continuing the sprawl that these amendments are designed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3206)|
| 0:53:32| address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3212)|
| 0:53:33| We can't forget that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3213)|
| 0:53:34| For these reasons, our association asks that you vote to approve the plan before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3214)|
| 0:53:38| you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3218)|
| 0:53:39| It's something that's necessary and it's the first step in addressing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3219)|
| 0:53:42| housing situation that we have all been facing for the last five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3222)|
| 0:53:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3227)|
| 0:53:48| Council members, there's two people who signed up to speak and they're neutral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3228)|
| 0:53:55| or in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3235)|
| 0:53:57| It's a little ambiguous, so I'll go ahead and call on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3237)|
| 0:54:00| First is Kevin Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3240)|
| 0:54:02| Mr. Murphy, are you present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3242)|
| 0:54:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3244)|
| 0:54:06| Next is Wolf Najeli.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3246)|
| 0:54:13| Go ahead, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3253)|
| 0:54:14| If you could start by stating your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3254)|
| 0:54:16| you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3256)|
| 0:54:18| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3258)|
| 0:54:19| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| I'm here neutral and slash in support of this growth plan amendment that's in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3261)|
| 0:54:26| front of you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3266)|
| 0:54:28| This is a much better amendment than this council saw about four or five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3268)|
| 0:54:32| ago that came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3272)|
| 0:54:33| I'm very happy about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3273)|
| 0:54:36| The one issue that I do want to talk and just bring your attention to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3276)|
| 0:54:40| really does impact the city of Knoxville the most is probably the 4,800 acres of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3280)|
| 0:54:44| planned growth expansion in the northeast county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3284)|
| 0:54:48| That large area of planned growth expansion is pretty much dependent on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3288)|
| 0:54:54| traveling through city-owned infrastructure to reach most of the employment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3294)|
| 0:54:59| centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3299)|
| 0:55:00| The reason why it's important is northeast Knox and the northeast Knox sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3300)|
| 0:55:05| doesn't have a lot of employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| I was just looking at the northeast Knox sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3307)|
| 0:55:09| and these figures are from 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3309)|
| 0:55:12| Take them with a little bit of salt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3312)|
| 0:55:14| But there are about five, at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3314)|
| 0:55:18| about 95% of residents in the northeast Knox sector commuted outside of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3318)|
| 0:55:23| sector for work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3323)|
| 0:55:26| When you add residents in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3326)|
| 0:55:30| a lot of the employment and transport is going out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3330)|
| 0:55:33| Now that hits three or four major city-owned corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3333)|
| 0:55:37| The city, as annexed, has Tassel Pike out to about Murphy Road or maybe a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3337)|
| 0:55:42| little bit past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3342)|
| 0:55:43| You have Washington Pike to Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3343)|
| 0:55:45| You have Millertown Pike from the interstate out to the Norfolk Southern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3345)|
| 0:55:49| Railroad Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3349)|
| 0:55:50| And then you have Rutledge Pike as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3350)|
| 0:55:54| I was looking roughly, trying to figure out where are we with traffic counts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3354)|
| 0:55:59| and where are you with that infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3359)|
| 0:56:02| Millertown Pike, which I think if any of you remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3362)|
| 0:56:05| the city did a lot of work on Millertown Pike about five or six years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3365)|
| 0:56:09| through the mall area, which has helped some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3369)|
| 0:56:12| But I just looked at the trip count, and last year it was 17,800 in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3372)|
| 0:56:18| section between Kensal Way and Loves Creek Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3378)|
| 0:56:21| Two-lane road with turn lanes feels really congested at about 18,000 cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3381)|
| 0:56:26| So you're really maxed out on Millertown Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3386)|
| 0:56:29| The second one, Washington Pike, obviously you're well aware that you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3389)|
| 0:56:32| spending a lot of money to improve that and that design capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3392)|
| 0:56:38| Still, though, I was looking at Washington Pike between Mill Road and Target,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3398)|
| 0:56:42| which is going to be three lanes with a turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3402)|
| 0:56:44| That right now is at 14,200 cars, so you're getting close already to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3404)|
| 0:56:48| 18,000 car count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3408)|
| 0:56:50| You've got a little bit more overhead between Mill Road and out to Washington Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3410)|
| 0:56:54| Murphy Road, where you're going to be five-laning it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3414)|
| 0:56:57| But you're still, you know, that section right now is 21,000 cars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3417)|
| 0:57:01| and those roads start to feel really crowded and congested at about 36,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3421)|
| 0:57:07| So there's a lot of potential impact of city infrastructure and transit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3427)|
| 0:57:11| and that's something that when this planned growth area is being proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3431)|
| 0:57:16| will probably create problems for the city over the next 10 and 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3436)|
| 0:57:23| If you want to use really round numbers and low numbers to give you an idea of magnitude,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3443)|
| 0:57:30| let's say it's 5,000 acres, two units an acre is a rough buildout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3450)|
| 0:57:35| Now, some of that's developed, some of it's off course in the attention center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3455)|
| 0:57:38| but let's say it's two units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3458)|
| 0:57:40| That's about 10,000 units out there eventually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3460)|
| 0:57:43| And those 10,000 units could potentially be five trips a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3463)|
| 0:57:52| That's 50,000 trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3472)|
| 0:57:54| Anyways, there's a lot of potential transportation issues down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3474)|
| 0:57:58| and I think that's something for city council to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3478)|
| 0:58:01| If you do approve tonight, I would ask, and maybe thinking of adding a similar contingent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3481)|
| 0:58:08| the county commission did where you just pass the growth plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3488)|
| 0:58:12| but contingent on the county commission adopting a new land use plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3492)|
| 0:58:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3496)|
| 0:58:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3498)|
| 0:58:19| Next person signed up to speak on this in, I think, opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3499)|
| 0:58:23| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3503)|
| 0:58:24| Wolf, how do you say, Nagely?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3504)|
| 0:58:27| Wolf Nagely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3507)|
| 0:58:28| Nagely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3508)|
| 0:58:29| Mr. Nagely, if you could start by stating your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3509)|
| 0:58:33| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3513)|
| 0:58:35| My name is Wolf Nagely, 4425 Balraj Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3515)|
| 0:58:39| and I'm speaking on behalf of the Foundation for Global Sustainability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3519)|
| 0:58:45| We urge you to reject the proposed growth policy plan for two primary reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3525)|
| 0:58:50| First, for the irresponsibly vast amount of good farmland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3530)|
| 0:58:54| and minimally disturbed acreage it wants to move into the planned growth area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3534)|
| 0:59:00| something that for all practical purposes is irreversible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3540)|
| 0:59:05| Second, for its failure to sincerely consider its impact on community resilience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3545)|
| 0:59:11| on environmental sustainability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3551)|
| 0:59:14| and on the future of existing neighborhoods and their property ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3554)|
| 0:59:19| Today we face much greater uncertainty about the future of our country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3559)|
| 0:59:24| and our county than ever in its history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3564)|
| 0:59:29| The impacts of increasing automation, artificial intelligence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3569)|
| 0:59:33| and business consolidations on our economy are hard to predict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3573)|
| 0:59:38| We got surprised by COVID-19 and how much disruption it caused,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3578)|
| 0:59:43| but there are also a lot of other global polycrisis that could affect us very strongly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3583)|
| 0:59:51| First of all, climate change, biodiversity loss, hunger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3591)|
| 0:59:56| human displacement, and rearmament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3596)|
| 1:00:00| The draft comprehensive plan has not even attempted to consider any of these factors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3600)|
| 1:00:06| and failed to assess likely socioeconomic policy outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3606)|
| 1:00:12| So it's all sort of hypothetical without really any serious study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3612)|
| 1:00:19| as to what the outcomes could be under different scenarios of how development will occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3619)|
| 1:00:28| With every passing month, it appears more likely global warming may reach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3628)|
| 1:00:32| or even exceed 3 degrees centigrade rather than the 1.5 degrees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3632)|
| 1:00:38| that was adopted by the Paris Agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3638)|
| 1:00:43| More and more it becomes clear that the cost of living is going up worldwide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3643)|
| 1:00:51| in tandem with increase of global warming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3651)|
| 1:00:55| Because crops are failing, there are more floodings, there are more storms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3655)|
| 1:01:00| more damages, which all increase the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3660)|
| 1:01:04| And now, for example, they can't even get the Panama Canal supplied with enough fresh water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3664)|
| 1:01:11| to transport a lot of the food that needs to go through the Panama Canal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3671)|
| 1:01:20| So we need to protect our fertile soils much better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3680)|
| 1:01:26| and young farmers find it exceedingly difficult to find affordable farmland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3686)|
| 1:01:31| Community-supported agriculture and community gardens are valuable components of community resilience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3691)|
| 1:01:38| And that's even true for the people who live in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3698)|
| 1:01:41| because we need the surrounding farms much more to supply our farmers' markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3701)|
| 1:01:52| And once farmland has been converted or opened to development, it can't be reversed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3712)|
| 1:02:00| Because first of all, you couldn't pay the landowners for the lost income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3720)|
| 1:02:06| if you wanted to put it back into agricultural protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3726)|
| 1:02:11| And also, if you have built on the soils, you can't practically restore them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3731)|
| 1:02:17| because the quality of the soils will be too much degraded to make it practical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3737)|
| 1:02:22| to farm them sustainably and economically in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3742)|
| 1:02:30| The current growth policy plan was never meant to last for the 20-plus years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3750)|
| 1:02:35| Yet the proposed growth policy plan seems to be geared for another 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3755)|
| 1:02:41| They want to put so much land from agriculture into plant growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3761)|
| 1:02:47| which could last for quite a while, but it will also make it much more sprawled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3767)|
| 1:02:54| Because if you open a lot of it at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3774)|
| 1:02:57| of course there is more pressure into the different areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3777)|
| 1:03:02| rather than focusing on the ones that are best suited for development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3782)|
| 1:03:07| based on the transportation, on the services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3787)|
| 1:03:12| And that's really for the future of current homeowners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3792)|
| 1:03:16| property owners in Knox County, and taxpayers essentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3796)|
| 1:03:20| because you need to consider the costs down land for the road improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3800)|
| 1:03:28| and the social services that are needed and the first response services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3808)|
| 1:03:35| Thank you very much. Your five minutes are up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3815)|
| 1:03:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3818)|
| 1:03:40| Council members, that concludes the people who signed up to speak on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3820)|
| 1:03:46| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3826)|
| 1:03:48| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3828)|
| 1:03:52| I don't know if this is a question for Ms. Brooks and or Mandy Benedict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3832)|
| 1:03:57| So I don't know if Ms. Benedict wants to move towards the front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3837)|
| 1:04:02| and I'll kind of work on my question here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3842)|
| 1:04:06| So there's a lot of references in feedback that we've gotten from the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3846)|
| 1:04:11| as well as some of the comments that were made tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3851)|
| 1:04:17| We are voting on, as well as the City of Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3857)|
| 1:04:21| are voting on the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3861)|
| 1:04:25| Is that correct, Ms. Brooks, not the comprehensive plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3865)|
| 1:04:28| Yes, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3868)|
| 1:04:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3869)|
| 1:04:31| So the comprehensive plan, what process or stage is the comprehensive plan in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3871)|
| 1:04:40| Where are you guys on that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3880)|
| 1:04:42| Amy Brooks, Knox County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3882)|
| 1:04:44| Currently we have had a draft of the comprehensive plan posted on the Advanced Knox website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3884)|
| 1:04:50| since October, a final draft plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3890)|
| 1:04:53| It is going before the Planning Commission this week on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3893)|
| 1:04:57| County Commission will have a workshop on it later this month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3897)|
| 1:05:00| and it will be voted on by County Commission as well, potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3900)|
| 1:05:03| But City Council nor the City of Farragut are voting on the comprehensive plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3903)|
| 1:05:07| No, it is only for the unincorporated areas of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3907)|
| 1:05:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3910)|
| 1:05:12| And what County Commission passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3912)|
| 1:05:15| what we have before us to vote on is vote up or down on the growth plan, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3915)|
| 1:05:22| Which is basically maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3922)|
| 1:05:25| It is the maps and the additional edits to the growth policy plan, correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3925)|
| 1:05:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3929)|
| 1:05:30| Vote up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3930)|
| 1:05:31| And what County Commission voted on was making the passage of it contingent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3931)|
| 1:05:38| on passing the comprehensive plan, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3938)|
| 1:05:41| They voted unanimously to approve the amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3941)|
| 1:05:44| but they did not want it to go into effect until the comprehensive plan was voted on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3944)|
| 1:05:49| and went into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3949)|
| 1:05:51| And so what that does is it leaves the old growth policy plan in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3951)|
| 1:05:57| until the new comp plan is passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3957)|
| 1:06:00| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3960)|
| 1:06:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3961)|
| 1:06:03| I just think it is really important to clarify some of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3963)|
| 1:06:06| some of the feedback that has come from community members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3966)|
| 1:06:10| on what we are voting on is pointing to things that are in the comp plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3970)|
| 1:06:14| which we do not vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3974)|
| 1:06:17| And so there has been muddying of the water and unclarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3977)|
| 1:06:22| I know I have colleagues here that want to vote on things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3982)|
| 1:06:27| or I'm sorry, have their own comments to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3987)|
| 1:06:30| but I would potentially make a friendly amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3990)|
| 1:06:35| to mirror what the Planning Commission did, I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3995)|
| 1:06:39| the County Commission did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=3999)|
| 1:06:41| which is to amend and make this passage of the growth policy plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4001)|
| 1:06:47| contingent on passage of the comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4007)|
| 1:06:52| Thank you, Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4012)|
| 1:06:55| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4015)|
| 1:06:59| Ms. Brooks, I also want to be sure that I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4019)|
| 1:07:03| it takes all three bodies to approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4023)|
| 1:07:07| So if any one of the three bodies does not approve this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4027)|
| 1:07:13| we have no new growth policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4033)|
| 1:07:18| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4038)|
| 1:07:19| So if, I appreciate what Councilwoman Ryder said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4039)|
| 1:07:23| but even if we approved it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4043)|
| 1:07:26| if the County Commission doesn't get what they want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4046)|
| 1:07:29| then it won't, if it's contingent upon taking effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4049)|
| 1:07:33| when the comprehensive plan is done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4053)|
| 1:07:37| this wouldn't take effect countywide until such time, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4057)|
| 1:07:42| Yes, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4062)|
| 1:07:43| And the Town of Farragut also still has to consider this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4063)|
| 1:07:47| Right, but if any, I guess what I'm saying is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4067)|
| 1:07:50| the thing that we're worried about, if we're concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4070)|
| 1:07:53| is that if we vote yes with no contingency upon it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4073)|
| 1:07:58| the County Commission contingency still is out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4078)|
| 1:08:02| so it would not take effect even if we did not make that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4082)|
| 1:08:06| Yes, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4086)|
| 1:08:07| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4087)|
| 1:08:09| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4089)|
| 1:08:15| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4095)|
| 1:08:18| And the growth policy plan is coming before City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4098)|
| 1:08:23| as a requirement of state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4103)|
| 1:08:25| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4105)|
| 1:08:35| Do you have an understanding of that state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4115)|
| 1:08:38| and why it requires the votes of City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4118)|
| 1:08:45| Town of Farragut, and the county to approve the growth policy plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4125)|
| 1:08:52| I wasn't around when it was originally crafted, the legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4132)|
| 1:08:56| I think the intent was to encourage jurisdictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4136)|
| 1:09:00| that are within the same county to work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4140)|
| 1:09:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4144)|
| 1:09:10| My concern with this process is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4150)|
| 1:09:14| without knowing what the end results are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4154)|
| 1:09:19| it seems like our vote today would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4159)|
| 1:09:24| the county may adopt additional changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4164)|
| 1:09:30| We'll adopt a comprehensive land use plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4170)|
| 1:09:33| that we will not have seen before we approve this growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4173)|
| 1:09:41| And it seems like we are assuming those are decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4181)|
| 1:09:46| that should be made by the county and would only need our approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4186)|
| 1:09:54| I'm a little unclear on why we would have a role to vote in this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4194)|
| 1:10:05| if we do not wait for all final documents to be finalized before we vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4205)|
| 1:10:12| That would be my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4212)|
| 1:10:14| That's where my head is at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4214)|
| 1:10:17| Thank you, Councilmember Riders and Councilmember Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4217)|
| 1:10:22| Then I'll go over to that side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4222)|
| 1:10:27| I want to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4227)|
| 1:10:30| Ms. Brooks, am I next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4230)|
| 1:10:33| Since they haven't had a chance, I didn't see their lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4233)|
| 1:10:35| I'm sorry, Vice Mayor Smith and then Councilmember Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4235)|
| 1:10:40| We'll come back to you, Ms. Riders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4240)|
| 1:10:43| We voted on something similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4243)|
| 1:10:46| It's okay. You have a chance. It's not over yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4246)|
| 1:10:50| Vice Mayor Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4250)|
| 1:10:51| I was going to ask Mr. Frost if you'd address that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4251)|
| 1:10:54| Good question from Councilman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4254)|
| 1:10:57| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4257)|
| 1:10:59| I think part of this issue, I was talking with Law Director Swanson today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4259)|
| 1:11:03| and I jokingly said, where's Commissioner Frank Luthold when you need him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4263)|
| 1:11:09| There was a very divisive time up in Ebb and Flow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4269)|
| 1:11:15| in the history between the city and county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4275)|
| 1:11:18| and the number of annexations that the city did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4278)|
| 1:11:23| Part of this, at the time, was negotiated between the city and the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4283)|
| 1:11:29| and Mr. Luthold was one of the people involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4289)|
| 1:11:32| where it laid out the areas where the city could annex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4292)|
| 1:11:36| and the county would not object to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4296)|
| 1:11:39| Individual property owners could and did object to some of those annexations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4299)|
| 1:11:45| but part of this was to, one of the reasons, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4305)|
| 1:11:49| was to get local people talking about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4309)|
| 1:11:53| to try to avoid the situation that came into being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4313)|
| 1:11:59| some of the time 20-something years ago, approximately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4319)|
| 1:12:05| So that's part of the reason there, because if there's an agreement at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4325)|
| 1:12:10| where the city could annex out into the unincorporated parts of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4330)|
| 1:12:16| that was done by agreement to try to turn down the temperature of the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4336)|
| 1:12:25| Councilmember Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4345)|
| 1:12:29| I need to turn your microphone on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4349)|
| 1:12:31| It's more of a comment, I think, than anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4351)|
| 1:12:35| I do share concerns that we haven't seen the comprehensive plan yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4355)|
| 1:12:40| and we're going to be voting on something before we have all the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4360)|
| 1:12:44| I do understand this impacts the county more than the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4364)|
| 1:12:48| but as Mr. Murphy had said, there's possibly consequences of the plan to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4368)|
| 1:12:56| I'm wondering what the drawback would be for us to delay our vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4376)|
| 1:13:03| until we had all the information in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4383)|
| 1:13:08| I guess I'm a little bit concerned about being surprised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4388)|
| 1:13:11| by what may come out of the comprehensive plan if I haven't seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4391)|
| 1:13:16| So those are kind of my thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4396)|
| 1:13:20| Councilmember Thomas, I think there's some downsides to postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4400)|
| 1:13:25| No matter what county commission does with their own land use ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4405)|
| 1:13:32| we don't get to determine that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4412)|
| 1:13:35| That's their authority, that's their obligation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4415)|
| 1:13:38| They already passed this growth policy plan contingent on their approval of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4418)|
| 1:13:43| that it won't take effect until city council and town of Farragut have approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4423)|
| 1:13:49| So delaying, you know, I don't think postponement aids the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4429)|
| 1:13:58| I also think while there are obviously impacts to the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4438)|
| 1:14:03| we're all Knox County residents, we all pay our Knox County taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4443)|
| 1:14:06| we're all affected by the land uses throughout our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4446)|
| 1:14:10| the air pollution, the water pollution or lack thereof affects us all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4450)|
| 1:14:16| To me, the big danger of delay is that it will just revert to the status quo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4456)|
| 1:14:22| which is unfettered growth without a lot of planning, and it's sprawl,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4462)|
| 1:14:27| and that's hurting us already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4467)|
| 1:14:29| So the choice is not between an amazing, perfect plan that everything is just right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4469)|
| 1:14:37| and this that you're voting on, it's this or the status quo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4477)|
| 1:14:41| So I think postponement has some downsides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4481)|
| 1:14:44| Law Director Swanson had something he wanted to share to add some information and an insight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4484)|
| 1:14:51| Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4491)|
| 1:14:52| I'm just concerned that there might be a little misunderstanding about what the impact will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4492)|
| 1:14:59| with regard to the county's adoption of their comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4499)|
| 1:15:04| This plan is not going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4504)|
| 1:15:07| If this plan changes, then it's got to come back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4507)|
| 1:15:11| But if you pass this plan tonight, it's only this plan that's going to be passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4511)|
| 1:15:18| So if county commission comes back and changes their plan in some way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4518)|
| 1:15:22| which they don't really plan to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4522)|
| 1:15:24| they really plan to pass their comprehensive plan that only applies within the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4524)|
| 1:15:29| doesn't apply within the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4529)|
| 1:15:31| but if they change their growth plan in some way, it's got to come back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4531)|
| 1:15:36| They're not going to be able to make changes in their comprehensive plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4536)|
| 1:15:41| that will in some way change this growth plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4541)|
| 1:15:44| so that what you've approved is something that you didn't see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4544)|
| 1:15:47| That won't be the case at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4547)|
| 1:15:49| If they don't approve it as it is right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4549)|
| 1:15:53| then it will not be approved unless you all subsequently approve it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4553)|
| 1:15:59| And if you make city council's approval contingent upon the county's approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4559)|
| 1:16:07| of the comprehensive plan, that's really surplusage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4567)|
| 1:16:11| because the county commission already did that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4571)|
| 1:16:15| and so it doesn't really make any difference whether you do it or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4575)|
| 1:16:18| because if they don't do it, then they don't have a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4578)|
| 1:16:21| and it's going to have to come back to you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4581)|
| 1:16:24| Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4584)|
| 1:16:27| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4587)|
| 1:16:28| I think what Director Swanson said and Mr. Frost said is completely correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4588)|
| 1:16:33| I think the focus we have to have tonight is on what city council has a vote on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4593)|
| 1:16:38| which is the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4598)|
| 1:16:41| We don't have a vote on what county commission does for their comprehensive plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4601)|
| 1:16:47| that affects the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4607)|
| 1:16:49| We don't have a say in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4609)|
| 1:16:53| So if I focus my thoughts and comments on the amendments to the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4613)|
| 1:17:01| I think that's the way I view the right approach for us this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4621)|
| 1:17:07| I also wanted to concur with what Mr. Murphy said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4627)|
| 1:17:11| He did talk about impact on city infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4631)|
| 1:17:14| and what the mayor said is correct, what he said was correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4634)|
| 1:17:19| We're all county residents as well as city residents, so we all have an impact here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4639)|
| 1:17:25| The impact on city infrastructure, specifically we're thinking about traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4645)|
| 1:17:30| which Mr. Murphy talked about, and we're talking about water flow and flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4650)|
| 1:17:36| Some of the comments that were made about this amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4656)|
| 1:17:42| we're talking about responsible growth, and I'm a major advocate for smart growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4662)|
| 1:17:48| addressing sprawling neighborhoods without proper roads into the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4668)|
| 1:17:53| It was correct that what you see in the growth policy plan is a reduction from a maximum of three units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4673)|
| 1:18:02| down to two units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4682)|
| 1:18:04| So that is a reduction, and so that was correct with what was said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4684)|
| 1:18:10| But the troubling part for me is that the amendment to the growth policy plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4690)|
| 1:18:15| removes the requirement for a traffic analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4695)|
| 1:18:18| and so when we're talking about proper roads into the rural area, that's troubling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4698)|
| 1:18:25| I'm not sure why that language is being removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4705)|
| 1:18:30| It does add a requirement for a two-lane paved road being part of that infrastructure that you have to put in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4710)|
| 1:18:37| so the same water and sewage issues that were in the old or the current growth policy plan are still there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4717)|
| 1:18:44| so that infrastructure is still there, but it adds the requirement for a two-lane road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4724)|
| 1:18:51| It also removes the requirement that it go through the planned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4731)|
| 1:18:54| that these developments in the rural area go through the planned residential process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4734)|
| 1:18:59| which I think is a great tool, and I wish we had it in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4739)|
| 1:19:04| So I'm not sure why that's being removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4744)|
| 1:19:09| It also removes all the language about hillside and ridgetop protection in the rural area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4749)|
| 1:19:14| and replaces it with rezoning of slopes shall be based on the adopted policies of each legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4754)|
| 1:19:19| To be clear, the city of Knoxville is the only one of the legislative bodies that have a vote that have codified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4759)|
| 1:19:26| meaning that we've adopted hillside ridgetop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4766)|
| 1:19:29| I don't have a vote on whether the county decides that or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4769)|
| 1:19:32| but it is troubling that that language is removed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4772)|
| 1:19:38| I did have, I've got a little bit of time, some questions for Ms. Brooks, I think just for some clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4778)|
| 1:19:47| When I look at the maps, and I think that when the public looks at the maps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4787)|
| 1:19:54| and it may just be my eyesight's poor, it could also be that the detail on the maps is a little tough to read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4794)|
| 1:20:01| it's obvious that there are changes, but it doesn't look like there's giant changes to where the rural area is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4801)|
| 1:20:12| It looks pretty much intact from what it was in the current version,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4812)|
| 1:20:17| and then there's not really any change to the urban area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4817)|
| 1:20:21| and then the growth area looks like it changed a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4821)|
| 1:20:26| Can you talk to us a little bit about what has changed in the map between what's current,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4826)|
| 1:20:32| because it looks almost the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4832)|
| 1:20:36| Ms. Brooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4836)|
| 1:20:37| Yes, I can start to answer that, and then I might ask my colleagues to weigh in as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4837)|
| 1:20:43| Yes, so Councilmember, you are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4843)|
| 1:20:47| The rural area remains primarily intact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4847)|
| 1:20:53| There is an increase of 7% of the planned growth area, and that equals 14.5 square miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4853)|
| 1:21:04| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4864)|
| 1:21:06| That does, that does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4866)|
| 1:21:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4867)|
| 1:21:08| And what is the impact in the rural?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4868)|
| 1:21:12| In the rural area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4872)|
| 1:21:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4873)|
| 1:21:14| 14.5 square miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4874)|
| 1:21:15| Is that reduction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4875)|
| 1:21:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4878)|
| 1:21:19| Okay, so 14.5 reduction in rural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4879)|
| 1:21:28| And, I mean, you guys are welcome to comment on the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4888)|
| 1:21:31| if my analysis of what the changes are is incorrect, then obviously I want to be corrected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4891)|
| 1:21:36| but that's the way I read what the amendments do, and I think I'm out of time, but I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4896)|
| 1:21:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4903)|
| 1:21:45| I'll go back to Councilmember Ryder, Fugates, and Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4905)|
| 1:21:52| Mr. Frost, if, you know, one thing that got thrown out was to postpone it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4912)|
| 1:21:56| what are the consequences of if we don't pass?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4916)|
| 1:22:01| Thank you, Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4921)|
| 1:22:03| Or if we don't vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4923)|
| 1:22:04| Well, I've reviewed 68-58-104,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4924)|
| 1:22:09| and this body must act within 120 days after they receive the recommended growth plan from the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4929)|
| 1:22:19| If they fail to do so, it's deemed adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4939)|
| 1:22:24| So the city council has the ability to either ratify or reject the recommended growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4944)|
| 1:22:34| Revise it is not an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4954)|
| 1:22:36| It's either ratify or reject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4956)|
| 1:22:39| Or not act on it and it passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4959)|
| 1:22:41| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4961)|
| 1:22:42| Over 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4962)|
| 1:22:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4964)|
| 1:22:45| Ms. Brooks, this is the first step in revising the land use plans for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4965)|
| 1:22:53| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4973)|
| 1:22:55| Yes, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4975)|
| 1:22:56| So if we don't know where those boundaries are that are defined by this growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4976)|
| 1:23:02| we really can't complete the comprehensive land use and transportation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4982)|
| 1:23:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4986)|
| 1:23:09| One of the things that I needed clarity with, and I hadn't had time to look it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4989)|
| 1:23:16| four of us of the nine of us sitting up here, council members, were on the previous council make-up pre-2019, December 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=4996)|
| 1:23:27| And we voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5007)|
| 1:23:28| There was a question about why are we voting on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5008)|
| 1:23:32| And Mr. Frost answered with a good history lesson on part of why we might be involved on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5012)|
| 1:23:38| But just for historical purposes, I love the history and the facts, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5018)|
| 1:23:45| We were presented with the vote to remove ourselves from the ability to vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5025)|
| 1:23:52| And that did not happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5032)|
| 1:23:55| So I think it's important to know that we only vote on the growth plan but not the next steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5035)|
| 1:24:02| And looking at the maps, so there's maps and there's how many pages of text that go along with the maps that we're voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5042)|
| 1:24:14| I'll double check here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5054)|
| 1:24:15| Well, okay, how about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5055)|
| 1:24:16| So Councilman Roberto asked about the hillside ridgetop component being removed from the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5056)|
| 1:24:26| Can you clarify that for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5066)|
| 1:24:30| Is there language about hillside ridgetops that's removed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5070)|
| 1:24:34| Yes, I think the intent of refining that language was to acknowledge that each jurisdiction has different policies related to hillside and ridgetop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5074)|
| 1:24:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5084)|
| 1:24:45| Because the city has always had, or I shouldn't say always, the city since the council before my time, 2017,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5085)|
| 1:24:55| put in place a hillside ridgetop protection for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5095)|
| 1:25:03| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5103)|
| 1:25:04| And it was not codified until the update to the city zoning code in 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5104)|
| 1:25:08| Okay, so the city did that but the county did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5108)|
| 1:25:11| It is advisory only in the county currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5111)|
| 1:25:13| Okay, it's advisory only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5113)|
| 1:25:15| So what are the impacts of removing it from the growth policy plan in what we're voting on tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5115)|
| 1:25:20| There are no impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5120)|
| 1:25:22| The county commission, it's a legislative action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5122)|
| 1:25:25| If they so choose, they could still choose to adopt that plan and incorporate it into their land use plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5125)|
| 1:25:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5132)|
| 1:25:33| So we're not removing something that they weren't doing in the first place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5133)|
| 1:25:37| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5137)|
| 1:25:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5139)|
| 1:25:42| Councilmember Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5142)|
| 1:25:45| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5145)|
| 1:25:46| I fully intend to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5146)|
| 1:25:48| I think what we're hearing is that it is the county's responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5148)|
| 1:25:52| It's the county's plan to set this growth policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5152)|
| 1:25:56| We have benefited, and the objective of talking about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5156)|
| 1:26:00| and us understanding the implications that this new boundary will have on the city is good for us to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5160)|
| 1:26:06| That's the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5166)|
| 1:26:07| We're not surprised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5167)|
| 1:26:09| I would also like to remind everyone who has real concerns about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5169)|
| 1:26:14| who lives within the city limits to participate in the county's comprehensive plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5174)|
| 1:26:22| that they will do after they have a growth policy plan to begin the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5182)|
| 1:26:28| I think I'm naming these things correctly, but it's late, and I might have them backwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5188)|
| 1:26:35| I just think that city residents also need to understand they are county residents, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5195)|
| 1:26:40| and please participate in that and talk to your county commissioners who will vote on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5200)|
| 1:26:45| who also represent the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5205)|
| 1:26:47| It's not that city residents don't have a voice in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5207)|
| 1:26:51| They do, but it's through their county commissioners on some of those actions that are the county purview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5211)|
| 1:26:59| But if you live in the city, the things that are codified in the city, this doesn't take away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5219)|
| 1:27:05| Am I correct, Ms. Brooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5225)|
| 1:27:08| Yes, you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5228)|
| 1:27:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5229)|
| 1:27:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5230)|
| 1:27:11| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5231)|
| 1:27:15| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5235)|
| 1:27:16| My issue is still with the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5236)|
| 1:27:18| If we are a party to this vote, then this is our space for negotiation as far as I see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5238)|
| 1:27:29| The county has started this process, and I imagine doesn't want the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5249)|
| 1:27:35| or the town of Farragut to vote it down and have all that work go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5255)|
| 1:27:40| As we have questions or concerns, to me, this would be our opportunity to have those conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5260)|
| 1:27:49| It's been presented to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5269)|
| 1:27:50| Now we have 120 days to decide whether to take action on it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5270)|
| 1:27:55| To have a process in place where we acknowledge that we have a limited role, but we do have a role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5275)|
| 1:28:06| But because that role is limited, we essentially just follow the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5286)|
| 1:28:14| and we don't really have our own position on this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5294)|
| 1:28:18| It concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5298)|
| 1:28:21| I've been listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5301)|
| 1:28:24| We can't amend this because one of my thoughts was to consider the boundaries that have been changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5304)|
| 1:28:34| the maps that have been changed, but not the other changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5314)|
| 1:28:37| It doesn't sound like that's a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5317)|
| 1:28:40| But what is a possibility is a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5320)|
| 1:28:43| And there could be changes made to the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5323)|
| 1:28:47| There could be discussions that take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5327)|
| 1:28:50| There could be further clarification that is had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5330)|
| 1:28:58| As we prepare for a final vote, without that sort of process in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5338)|
| 1:29:06| I don't believe, kind of speaking to what was said earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5346)|
| 1:29:11| we are fulfilling the intent behind the state law for us to work together as three governments to achieve the best outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5351)|
| 1:29:25| We're simply following the lead of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5365)|
| 1:29:28| I think that it is incumbent upon us to do more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5368)|
| 1:29:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5375)|
| 1:29:36| Council Member Helsley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5376)|
| 1:29:38| Oh, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5378)|
| 1:29:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5379)|
| 1:29:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5381)|
| 1:29:42| Any further questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5382)|
| 1:29:46| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5386)|
| 1:29:49| I'll make a motion that we postpone this item until our April 30th city council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5389)|
| 1:29:58| There's a motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5398)|
| 1:29:59| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5399)|
| 1:30:01| Motion fails for lack of a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5401)|
| 1:30:03| Back to the motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5403)|
| 1:30:06| Vice Mayor Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5406)|
| 1:30:08| I just want to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5408)|
| 1:30:09| Councilman Ryder, did you make a motion to amend earlier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5409)|
| 1:30:14| I made a motion to amend to mirror what county commission did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5414)|
| 1:30:20| I think they unanimously, from both ends of the political spectrum, supported the growth policy plan that we are faced with voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5420)|
| 1:30:30| They have not surrounded and flanked us with a donut of industrial land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5430)|
| 1:30:38| They've reduced density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5438)|
| 1:30:40| I could argue that maybe I don't agree with their reduction in density, but maybe that's best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5440)|
| 1:30:45| And they put in a very good faith and collaborative effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5445)|
| 1:30:50| If you look at the maps, which is what we're voting on, they put in a good faith collaborative effort with members of the community, I believe, including Kevin Murphy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5450)|
| 1:31:00| where areas that are rural now were removed from that map to retain and maintain areas of farmland and rural property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5460)|
| 1:31:15| So they greatly reduced, when you mirror over the map, they greatly reduced what they proposed as areas to increase density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5475)|
| 1:31:27| And I feel that I'm going to just refresh folks' memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5487)|
| 1:31:33| When a member of county commission came down here and told us how to do our business, it was not well received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5493)|
| 1:31:40| And when they said that our city employees didn't need raises and what we should be doing, it was not well received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5500)|
| 1:31:47| It was not well received by our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5507)|
| 1:31:49| It was not well received by members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5509)|
| 1:31:54| If it looked from these maps and other things that the county was doing something egregious, which is why we're part of the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5514)|
| 1:32:02| and both ends of their political spectrum unanimously voting to support this with the amendment that I'm going to make, if someone will second it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5522)|
| 1:32:12| to pass this contingent on the comprehensive plan, which is their purview to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5532)|
| 1:32:19| And they didn't come tell us how to do recode, though plenty of people had opinions, and they let us know their opinions as our constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5539)|
| 1:32:28| So I make a motion to adopt the growth plan contingent on them passing the comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5548)|
| 1:32:38| I'll second for a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5558)|
| 1:32:41| Vice Mayor Smith, your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5561)|
| 1:32:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5563)|
| 1:32:44| And that's just for Mr. Frost or Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5564)|
| 1:32:47| Is that a substantial change to the process that makes it go all the way through this system again, or is this just a belt and suspenders amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5567)|
| 1:32:57| I think Councilman Ryder said it was a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5577)|
| 1:32:59| I want to make sure that there's not a substantial change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5579)|
| 1:33:02| I wouldn't think it's a substantial change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5582)|
| 1:33:06| Use your microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5586)|
| 1:33:08| It's surplusage to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5588)|
| 1:33:10| It's simply what the county already did, and it's related to not this growth plan, but it is related to the county's comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5590)|
| 1:33:20| So essentially what you're saying is we're not going to pass this growth plan unless the county adopts its comprehensive development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5600)|
| 1:33:30| which county commission already said, and it's their comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5610)|
| 1:33:35| So you're just laying the same wording on top of theirs, because if they don't pass it, then they don't have a plan under what they passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5615)|
| 1:33:46| And if they don't have a plan, then this plan will not be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5626)|
| 1:33:50| So this will mirror what they have passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5630)|
| 1:33:54| Vice Mayor Smith and Councilmember Ryder, I think this will mirror, but I think it's also redundant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5634)|
| 1:34:01| It's just saying, please do what you already unanimously said you were going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5641)|
| 1:34:05| I think we would be doing what you said you didn't want to do, Councilmember Ryder, like coming in and saying, this is how we think you should do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5645)|
| 1:34:14| We're echoing it, so I just think it's redundant and doesn't necessarily move the ball forward in any way, because we're just endorsing what they've already said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5654)|
| 1:34:27| Which would be passing the growth policy plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5667)|
| 1:34:32| I mean, that's just my take on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5672)|
| 1:34:35| I do also want to just say, the way the state law is written, there's a growth plan committee, and the city had representation on that, and that was me, the mayor of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5675)|
| 1:34:45| I participated in multiple meetings, many hours, reviewed materials, listened to feedback, reviewed the amendments made in response to that feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5685)|
| 1:34:55| Asked questions, realized that it's hard decisions, listened to various stakeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5695)|
| 1:35:04| So the city did have a say in the process, in addition to city council's vote on the approved growth policy map and plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5704)|
| 1:35:14| So I think the state's law has provided for more collaborative, community-wide participation than it otherwise would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5714)|
| 1:35:24| So I'm thankful for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5724)|
| 1:35:26| The plan isn't perfect, but we're very familiar with imperfection and trying to govern the best we can in the face of those challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5726)|
| 1:35:36| Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5736)|
| 1:35:38| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5738)|
| 1:35:39| I just wanted to respond that city council did not have a representative on that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5739)|
| 1:35:45| So it comes before us to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5745)|
| 1:35:47| We're the legislative body, and we haven't had a representative in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5747)|
| 1:35:54| If the state law required approval from the mayors of all three entities, I think it would have been written that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5754)|
| 1:36:07| But it wasn't written that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5767)|
| 1:36:08| It was written for the legislative approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5768)|
| 1:36:13| And so, you know, my opinion is still the same that this is the beginning of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5773)|
| 1:36:21| And we are just now engaging in these conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5781)|
| 1:36:27| We've gotten a couple of updates over the last year at our city council dinners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5787)|
| 1:36:33| But we haven't had a conversation to say, hey, to get city council support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5793)|
| 1:36:40| This is what we're hearing from our constituents who are also county residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5800)|
| 1:36:44| Unlike those in the county who don't live in city limits, we don't represent them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5804)|
| 1:36:51| So I understand them not participating in recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5811)|
| 1:36:55| But the county residents who are in the city limits, it makes sense for them to participate in recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5815)|
| 1:37:01| It makes sense for county commissioners to participate in recode if they're in the city limits, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5821)|
| 1:37:07| But if we represent the city and there's an overlap with county residents in the city, it makes sense that we would have a voice as the legislative body of the city in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5827)|
| 1:37:22| I'll say it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5842)|
| 1:37:24| It makes sense for us to have a voice in this process because we are a part of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5844)|
| 1:37:35| Yes, we represent the city, but we are also part of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5855)|
| 1:37:42| The county doesn't always participate in our processes because they, county commissioners, might be located outside of the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5862)|
| 1:37:51| They might think they're representing folks who are only outside of the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5871)|
| 1:37:57| But some of those county residents do live within the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5877)|
| 1:38:01| They're very welcome to participate in our city activities because they're both city and county residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5881)|
| 1:38:10| I don't feel comfortable with voting on something and stating that this is the county's policies to determine because we have a state law that requires our participation in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5890)|
| 1:38:28| And this is our opportunity to think about how growth outside of the city limits will impact quality of life here in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5908)|
| 1:38:41| And that not only includes traffic, but that does include different types of land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5921)|
| 1:38:48| How much agricultural land do we have access to around our community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5928)|
| 1:38:54| I'm interested in what happens not only in the city limits, in the unincorporated limits, the rural limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5934)|
| 1:39:03| I believe we should have a voice overall in this process on the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5943)|
| 1:39:13| And I will agree with my colleagues that changes I'm seeing, some of the changes I'm seeing I'm in agreement with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5953)|
| 1:39:23| But the process is not complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5963)|
| 1:39:27| We don't have a final plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5967)|
| 1:39:30| And we're not using this opportunity to have a voice in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5970)|
| 1:39:37| It really throws me off that we would not use this as an opportunity to have a voice in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5977)|
| 1:39:44| But we would just toss the ball back to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5984)|
| 1:39:48| So I'm not able to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5988)|
| 1:39:52| We're obviously not going to postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5992)|
| 1:39:54| So I'll be voting against this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5994)|
| 1:39:57| And I also, you know, I would love to see us, you know, I hope to be a part of conversations in our community about how we can change this process moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=5997)|
| 1:40:10| So that we do have more participation from city and county residents in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6010)|
| 1:40:17| And that city residents do feel represented in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6017)|
| 1:40:24| We are also having discussions and workshops on this issue that we are expected to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6024)|
| 1:40:30| And that we're not just tossing the ball over to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6030)|
| 1:40:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6035)|
| 1:40:37| The motion on the floor is to amend it for Miss Ryder's proposed amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6037)|
| 1:40:44| Do you want to restate it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6044)|
| 1:40:46| Does everyone know what we're voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6046)|
| 1:40:49| Do you want to restate it so everyone's clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6049)|
| 1:40:53| So Mr. Johnson can read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6053)|
| 1:40:59| So the motion is to adopt the county growth policy plan contingent on county commission passing a comprehensive land use plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6059)|
| 1:41:10| Okay, does everyone understand what you're voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6070)|
| 1:41:13| So the amendment, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6073)|
| 1:41:16| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6076)|
| 1:41:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6078)|
| 1:41:19| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6079)|
| 1:41:21| Okay, we must better do a roll call, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6081)|
| 1:41:28| Yeah, this is a motion to amend it to add the contingency similar to what county commission did already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6088)|
| 1:41:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6097)|
| 1:41:39| Yeah, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6099)|
| 1:41:41| That was a motion to amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6101)|
| 1:41:43| So the motion to amend, Council Member Ryder, do you want to clarify that in any way to make sure everybody understands?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6103)|
| 1:41:49| Or do you feel like everyone understands it well enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6109)|
| 1:41:53| Just in case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6113)|
| 1:41:55| My motion is an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6115)|
| 1:41:59| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6119)|
| 1:42:01| To pass the growth policy plan as presented contingent on passing the county's passage of a new comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6121)|
| 1:42:11| Well, maybe the amendment would be to add a contingency and then go back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6131)|
| 1:42:18| All I'm trying to do is mirror what the county passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6138)|
| 1:42:21| So if you want to give me that moment, I'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6141)|
| 1:42:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6147)|
| 1:42:48| Ms. Brooks and Ms. Benedict, weren't you guys part of that conversation at that meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6168)|
| 1:42:53| Do you know exactly what county commission passed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6173)|
| 1:42:56| Yes, we are looking it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6176)|
| 1:42:57| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6177)|
| 1:43:05| Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6185)|
| 1:43:06| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6186)|
| 1:43:07| Well, Council Member Ryder is looking up that language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6187)|
| 1:43:10| I think I love the place where the amendment is coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6190)|
| 1:43:17| I can't support it because it's redundant, just like the lawyers have said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6197)|
| 1:43:22| Likewise, I can't support the growth policy amendment because of the problems that I had with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6202)|
| 1:43:27| I think our choices tonight are we can't make amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6207)|
| 1:43:31| You can pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6211)|
| 1:43:32| You can turn it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6212)|
| 1:43:34| Or if you want some more time to think about it, you can postpone it for some length of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6214)|
| 1:43:41| I don't see a change happening because the language isn't going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6221)|
| 1:43:47| So I'm kind of stuck where I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6227)|
| 1:43:50| But those are your options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6230)|
| 1:43:52| And if you guys want more time, I'll support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6232)|
| 1:43:56| I thought going all the way to April 30th was a little long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6236)|
| 1:44:05| The Planning Commission sees this on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6245)|
| 1:44:08| So there are more recent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6248)|
| 1:44:10| There's timeframes that are coming up closer than in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6250)|
| 1:44:14| That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6254)|
| 1:44:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6256)|
| 1:44:17| Vice Mayor Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6257)|
| 1:44:19| I just want to add I'm not willing to do a long postponement without a specific need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6259)|
| 1:44:24| And I think given Mr. Swanson and Mr. Frost's comment, I think we're okay to vote on this without the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6264)|
| 1:44:31| I appreciate the friendly amendment from Councilman Ryder, but it's all the same to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6271)|
| 1:44:37| I think we can move ahead with the vote without the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6277)|
| 1:44:41| It's redundant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6281)|
| 1:44:42| I'm not married to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6282)|
| 1:44:43| It was just a request from constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6283)|
| 1:44:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6288)|
| 1:44:49| Councilmember Ryder, are you withdrawing the proposed amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6289)|
| 1:44:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6292)|
| 1:44:53| We're back to the original motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6293)|
| 1:44:56| Councilmember Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6296)|
| 1:44:58| Put your microphone on, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6298)|
| 1:45:04| You know, one of the things that make this area really, really special is the ability that we've got a really vibrant city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6304)|
| 1:45:14| There's a lot to do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6314)|
| 1:45:16| There's an urban environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6316)|
| 1:45:17| But you can always get out of it quickly and get into nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6317)|
| 1:45:21| So that's really a lot of what makes East Tennessee special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6321)|
| 1:45:26| And that's a lot of the reasons why people live here and are coming here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6326)|
| 1:45:31| And it's the reason I live here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6331)|
| 1:45:33| You know, it's a really good balance of urban life and nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6333)|
| 1:45:41| So we really need to be protective of these areas outside of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6341)|
| 1:45:48| This is kind of a difficult thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6348)|
| 1:45:52| It is complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6352)|
| 1:45:55| I think the intent behind the plan before us is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6355)|
| 1:46:01| But, you know, what I've heard and the reasons that are given it is to concentrate growth where infrastructure is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6361)|
| 1:46:09| and then preserve the agricultural and more rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6369)|
| 1:46:16| There is a decrease in the density in the rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6376)|
| 1:46:20| And there is a cost savings, of course, to concentrating infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6380)|
| 1:46:26| And so it's almost to me it's like the choice is either killing this plan or keeping what we got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6386)|
| 1:46:37| And I think the plan as presented is better than what we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6397)|
| 1:46:42| And I do think council here is somewhat limited in what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6402)|
| 1:46:50| But I'm going to vote for it with the information that at least has been presented by me from the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6410)|
| 1:47:00| and the advanced Knoxville that formulated it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6420)|
| 1:47:03| And so, like I said, I think it's kind of the difference for me is killing it with one of the three municipalities rejecting it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6423)|
| 1:47:15| or keeping the status quo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6435)|
| 1:47:18| And I think the plan that is before us will be better than the status quo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6438)|
| 1:47:26| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6446)|

| 1:48:13| I'd like to ask Mr. Bentley and or R.J. if you could give us just a high-level overview of this project, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6493)|
| 1:48:22| Ms. Justice, if you'll begin and then if Mr. Bentley is here, but I mean either one of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6502)|
| 1:48:27| Sure, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6507)|
| 1:48:28| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6508)|
| 1:48:29| This property is along the North Broadway corridor in the downtown north area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6509)|
| 1:48:37| It was a building that operated as a dry cleaner from about the early 20s until the early 90s and has been vacant since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6517)|
| 1:48:47| The city currently owns that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6527)|
| 1:48:49| KCDC owns an adjacent property, and there is an opportunity to partner to activate this site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6529)|
| 1:48:58| and bring it back to life as a multi-tenant commercial space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6538)|
| 1:49:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6543)|
| 1:49:06| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6546)|
| 1:49:07| Yes, and I do have a bit of a cold tonight, and I've been trying to talk through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6547)|
| 1:49:12| But this resolution here is something I really can champion, I suppose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6552)|
| 1:49:21| If you look at it, all the things that we've been talking about and doing some of it along the corridors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6561)|
| 1:49:27| taking blighted property, turning it into affordable housing, the whole catalog of things that we've been trying to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6567)|
| 1:49:37| I think this is just a really good example of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6577)|
| 1:49:40| And so I'm really happy to see it and, of course, completely support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6580)|
| 1:49:46| And so the more of this that we do, I think the more we will actually have affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6586)|
| 1:49:54| the more we will clean up property on the corridors that we talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6594)|
| 1:49:58| So accolades to those who have pushed this through, and I look forward to more of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=6598)|

| 1:58:12| Mr. Zieda, are you present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=7092)|

| 1:58:18| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=7098)|

| 1:58:38| Hi, I am John Zieda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=7118)|
| 1:58:40| I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=7120)|
| 1:58:42| I am here again about Bilo and how the fire department's burning businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=7122)|
| 1:58:49| This is a ludicrous accusation, but it's a fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=7129)|
| 1:58:56| The first store was my father's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=7136)|
| 1:58:59| We didn't know that the city would send a fire department in and burn it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=7139)|
| 1:59:05| We knew that our store was stolen by the city in 1993, at the end of that year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=7145)|
| 1:59:13| In 92, we had a fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=7153)|
| 1:59:18| The Bilo store is 100% provable between the fire department and the police department and the coroner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=7158)|
| 1:59:30| Now we've got Parkway Hotel on Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=7170)|
| 1:59:35| Then we've got Planned Parenthood Clinic, which I brought up last time I was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=7175)|
| 1:59:41| The clinic...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=7181)|
| 1:59:47| Here's Bilo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=7187)|
| 1:59:49| Here's the camera in the walk-in cooler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=7189)|
| 1:59:52| Here's the clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=7192)|

| 1:59:59| Multiple devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=7199)|
| 2:00:02| Here's a picture of the devices again at the clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=7202)|
| 2:00:07| Here's a blow-up, and half of these, if not all of them, are from the news media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=7207)|
| 2:00:17| Nobody wants to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=7217)|
| 2:00:19| All I know is when an alarm goes off in the store in the middle of the night in a business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=7219)|
| 2:00:26| we as a business owner expect the fire department to protect us and the police department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=7226)|
| 2:00:33| not to burn the store and let the city come and steal it and make up a bogus report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=7233)|
| 2:00:38| India Gourley, he burned it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=7238)|
| 2:00:40| We don't know if it was on purpose or by accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=7240)|
| 2:00:43| That's what the police report stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=7243)|
| 2:00:46| Now, it doesn't stop there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=7246)|
| 2:00:49| Before I came here, I almost hesitated not to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=7249)|
| 2:00:55| Somehow, Regions Bank, the manager, it happened on a Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=7255)|
| 2:01:03| The employees had to know about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=7263)|
| 2:01:07| The bank was burned on 707 Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=7267)|
| 2:01:12| There's two pictures, one of a fireman, two of them, both of them are firemen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=7272)|
| 2:01:17| one inside and one outside by the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=7277)|
| 2:01:21| They're manipulated, and one of them, I can prove it clearheartedly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=7281)|
| 2:01:26| the one that's inside that store, the picture from the media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=7286)|
| 2:01:30| Regions Bank was burned by the fire department, and I can prove this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=7290)|
| 2:01:36| and I've asked for the arson pictures, and Captain Lampkin said they were ready| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=7296)|
| 2:01:43| and they were at the law department, and the law department said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=7303)|
| 2:01:47| go back to the fire department, and the fire department has not answered me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=7307)|
| 2:01:52| Now, the latest fire is Buddy's Barbecue at Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=7312)|
| 2:02:00| Buddy's Barbecue, again, I don't know why the fire department's burning these businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=7320)|
| 2:02:08| The employees, I don't think, are putting money in their pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=7328)|
| 2:02:12| Apparently, it's somebody from the city of Knoxville because I know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=7332)|
| 2:02:16| I've talked to one fireman, and he said when these firemen are hired on with the department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=7336)|
| 2:02:23| they're told to sign a document of disclosure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=7343)|
| 2:02:28| They cannot repeat what they see and do out to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=7348)|
| 2:02:34| Planned Parenthood, the list again, my father's store in 1992,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=7354)|
| 2:02:41| Bilo, I can prove it, a million percent, Parkway Hotel, Planned Parenthood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=7361)|
| 2:02:47| when anybody takes a look at these pictures, the devices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=7367)|
| 2:02:54| specifically this one, is scattered out all in the rafters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=7374)|
| 2:03:00| Imagine they're told to light them up, the building's on fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=7380)|
| 2:03:08| and the fire department goes down the street screeching with the sirens on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=7388)|
| 2:03:12| and it's the fire department that lit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=7392)|
| 2:03:16| It's the fire department that lit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=7396)|
| 2:03:19| And who's responsible for the arson investigation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=7399)|
| 2:03:24| The same people who lit Bilo, the same people who lit Parkway Hotel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=7404)|
| 2:03:33| the same one, Planned Parenthood Clinic, and Regions Bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240305?start=7413)|
