| 0:00:29| We'll call the annual meeting to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=29)|
| 0:00:39| We don't have to show that Commissioner is no longer with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=39)|
| 0:00:45| We have an election of officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=45)|
| 0:00:49| Yes, really quickly I can just recap what the purpose of the annual meeting is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=49)|
| 0:00:53| So, the Executive Director is tasked with presenting a reporting on activities of our staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=53)|
| 0:01:00| and immediately prior fiscal year a statement of our fiscal status to the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=60)|
| 0:01:04| In addition, the Commission shall elect officers and the Commission may conduct such business as otherwise you might want to add to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=64)|
| 0:01:12| So, I will try to keep our report brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=72)|
| 0:01:17| I know it's getting late, so I will do my best to move through this fairly quickly and I will provide you all with a copy of this presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=77)|
| 0:01:37| So, if you all have any additional questions, I'd be happy to answer them maybe or even go further in depth at a future agenda review meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=97)|
| 0:01:45| So, just to remind you all that we changed our annual meeting with the by-law updates that you all recently adopted earlier this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=105)|
| 0:01:53| So, instead of having this at the end of the year, we now have it at the end of our true fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=113)|
| 0:02:00| Okay, next slide please Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=120)|
| 0:02:04| So, this is a summary of the cases that our planning staff and you all have reviewed over the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=124)|
| 0:02:11| We've reviewed 479, approximately 479 total cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=131)|
| 0:02:16| It's comparable to what we did last year, but a little bit higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=136)|
| 0:02:21| Last year I think it was around 437, 440.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=141)|
| 0:02:26| Next slide please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=146)|
| 0:02:29| So, this is a brief overview of development activity trends over the past five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=149)|
| 0:02:33| As reported in our annual development activity report, which I hope you all have taken a look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=153)|
| 0:02:39| over 3,800 residential units have been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=159)|
| 0:02:43| In 2020, there were approximately 3,600.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=163)|
| 0:02:48| More than 1,300 subdivision lots have been created, up from last year's count of 900.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=168)|
| 0:02:53| And the value of residential construction has surpassed $800 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=173)|
| 0:02:58| Next slide please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=178)|
| 0:03:01| Over the past year, in addition to our heavy caseload, we've accomplished quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=181)|
| 0:03:06| We have partnered with Knox County on the Advanced Knox Project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=186)|
| 0:03:11| which takes up a lot of staff time and energy, not just the staff that attend these meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=191)|
| 0:03:15| but staff that are left behind in our office there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=195)|
| 0:03:20| So, the Alcoa Highway Study, which you all recently, you just approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=200)|
| 0:03:25| We wrapped that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=205)|
| 0:03:27| We wrapped up the North Shore Drive Corridor Study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=207)|
| 0:03:30| We participated in an I-40 interchange study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=210)|
| 0:03:33| And then there were several transit studies, which you all have received updates about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=213)|
| 0:03:37| that were undertaken by the TPO in partnership with CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=217)|
| 0:03:43| Next slide please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=223)|
| 0:03:47| Our Information Services staff has been very busy, as well as our TPO staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=227)|
| 0:03:52| in terms of developing new tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=232)|
| 0:03:54| We have a life-altering crash map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=234)|
| 0:03:56| It's building off of previous mapping and data analysis work that we have conducted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=236)|
| 0:04:01| related to pedestrian and bicycle-related crashes throughout the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=241)|
| 0:04:04| And staff created a new interactive map that shows where these crashes are occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=244)|
| 0:04:10| We have our Census Explorer tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=250)|
| 0:04:12| You all have heard me report on that a couple different times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=252)|
| 0:04:15| but it's an easier way for users to quickly and easily find answers utilizing the Census.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=255)|
| 0:04:23| We partnered with the city's Economic and Community Development team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=263)|
| 0:04:29| They had requested a mapping tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=269)|
| 0:04:31| They wanted to have a tool that inventory things like their pilot and TIF projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=271)|
| 0:04:35| redevelopment areas, student and affordable housing, and other ECD-related work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=275)|
| 0:04:39| that they had not been able to map previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=279)|
| 0:04:41| So our staff assisted them with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=281)|
| 0:04:44| We also have undertaken digital applications, which I'm personally really excited about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=284)|
| 0:04:50| Our staff is, as you all know, committed to continually updating our processes and procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=290)|
| 0:04:56| And so we are currently working on a digital application that will eventually become accessible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=296)|
| 0:05:01| on our website and available for all customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=301)|
| 0:05:04| So right now staff is testing it, the first phase of it, and so the rollout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=304)|
| 0:05:07| we will be using that internally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=307)|
| 0:05:10| So it really will help us improve how we are able to take in applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=310)|
| 0:05:15| It will be a lot quicker for us, a lot less of data entry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=315)|
| 0:05:24| A couple additional highlights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=324)|
| 0:05:25| The Edgewood Park City Design Guideline update is currently underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=325)|
| 0:05:28| I think Lindsey Crockett touched on that yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=328)|
| 0:05:31| And then we are undertaking the Missing Middle Housing Scan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=331)|
| 0:05:34| which we hope to have wrapped up in the next two to three months, which we'll report out on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=334)|
| 0:05:39| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=339)|
| 0:05:43| As you can see from this chart, or hopefully, it's kind of difficult for me to see from this distance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=343)|
| 0:05:49| but we have 38% of our revenues are generated by fees, which is up from last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=349)|
| 0:05:56| The county contributes about 21% of our budget, and the city contributed about 23% last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=356)|
| 0:06:01| Another 8% of our revenues are generated by state and federal grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=361)|
| 0:06:05| that are administered primarily by our transportation group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=365)|
| 0:06:08| The majority of these dollars are for special projects throughout the region, so they're reallocated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=368)|
| 0:06:12| We're considered a pass-through agency for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=372)|
| 0:06:15| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=375)|
| 0:06:17| As with most organizations, our employees are our greatest asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=377)|
| 0:06:21| So you'll see our largest investment is salaries and employment benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=381)|
| 0:06:27| We also have contracted services, which include legal services, public notices, equipment, and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=387)|
| 0:06:33| I will say that we are in very good financial standing at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=393)|
| 0:06:37| Our revenues are probably, again, so our reports are a little off right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=397)|
| 0:06:46| in terms of I don't have the year end yet, so we have final numbers from the end of April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=406)|
| 0:06:53| So those are tracking higher than what we had originally projected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=413)|
| 0:06:58| We're in a good position, and hopefully we'll continue to be so over the next year or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=418)|
| 0:07:04| Anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=424)|
| 0:07:07| I try to be quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=427)|
| 0:07:08| You did very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=428)|
| 0:07:09| You did very well, Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=429)|
| 0:07:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=431)|
| 0:07:14| Commissioner Roth had to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=434)|
| 0:07:15| He had another engagement he had to get to at 5.30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=435)|
| 0:07:18| so I volunteered to open it up for the election of officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=438)|
| 0:07:24| And before we do that, I just want to say thank you for all of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=444)|
| 0:07:27| for giving me the opportunity to serve as your chair the last, I guess, almost two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=447)|
| 0:07:32| And I especially want to give a shout out to Amy and Dory and Nick for helping me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=452)|
| 0:07:38| and I guess all of us during COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=458)|
| 0:07:40| I think going virtually was a challenge for all of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=460)|
| 0:07:45| and hopefully we don't have to experience that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=465)|
| 0:07:49| But thank all of you for giving me this opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=469)|
| 0:07:53| and I was glad I could be your chair at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=473)|
| 0:07:59| But the real reason we're here is to get the nomination from the nominating committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=479)|
| 0:08:07| who nominated Commissioner Hill as chair and Commissioner Uten as vice chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=487)|
| 0:08:14| And we didn't have any other persons brought forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=494)|
| 0:08:19| So with that, I'll entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=499)|
| 0:08:23| Commissioner Hill as chair and Commissioner Uten as vice chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=503)|
| 0:08:26| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=506)|
| 0:08:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=508)|
| 0:08:29| Who made the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=509)|
| 0:08:30| Commissioner Eddie Smith and seconded by Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=510)|
| 0:08:33| All in favor of the motion, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=513)|
| 0:08:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=515)|
| 0:08:36| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=516)|
| 0:08:38| Congratulations, gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=518)|
| 0:08:43| Any other comments before we adjourn the annual meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=523)|
| 0:08:48| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220609-annual-meeting?start=528)|
