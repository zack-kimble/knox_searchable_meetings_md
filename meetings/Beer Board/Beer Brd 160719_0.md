| 0:00:00| Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. It's five o'clock. This is our first five o'clock beer board meeting. And I believe that we have enough people here to have a quorum, which is a good thing. Mr. Johnson, will you call the roll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=0)|
| 0:00:14| Councilman Brown. Here. Councilman Campin. Councilman De La Volpe. Vice Mayor Greve. Here. Councilwoman Palmer. Here. Councilman Pavlis. Here. Councilman Saunders. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=14)|
| 0:00:28| Councilman Starr. Here. Councilman Wallace. Here. Thank you. Do I have a motion to approve the minutes of the last meeting? Second. All in favor? Aye. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=28)|
| 0:00:40| I have several announcements, and some of these are different than normal announcements, so that's an encouragement to listen up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=40)|
| 0:00:47| On June the 29th, the hearing officer heard five cases, and so I'm not going to go over all the details, but just briefly the outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=47)|
| 0:00:57| O'Charley's on Kingston Pike received a $250 fine, plus the cost of the administrative hearing, and that brought it to $430, and they did submit a remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=57)|
| 0:01:10| Da Vinci's Pizza and Calzone's on Sutherland did not return their beer permit within 15 days of closing. They want to surrender their permit, but they don't have it in their possession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=70)|
| 0:01:22| They were fined $120 administrative hearing costs. Pien de Cambio on North Broadway had their permit revoked. They are out of business, and they have to pay the cost of the administrative hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=82)|
| 0:01:35| Whiskey River Wild on Downtown West Boulevard did not respond to the complaint, did not have representation. The space where they were is vacant, and so their permit was revoked by default.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=95)|
| 0:01:48| And Tipsy's Patio Bar and Grill on Clinton Highway, sometimes known as Babylon Cafe, did not respond and was not represented at the hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=108)|
| 0:01:59| The location appears to be vacant, and their permit was revoked. Mr. Frost, in about 20 seconds, can you tell us what happens to the people who've had their permits revoked, and they might decide in six months they want to have another place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=119)|
| 0:02:17| Thank you, Chair. 4-73, I think, would apply, and considering the circumstances, more than likely Part G would apply, which means they're not eligible for a full year. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=137)|
| 0:02:29| All right. Thank you. So sometimes when we send things to the administrative hearing officer, we sort of think something's happened, but I wanted everybody to be real clear, and that when people get a permit, they are required to return it, and if they choose not to, there are consequences for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=149)|
| 0:02:46| Now, a reminder that we're still saving trees, so pass your stuff around. If we continue, someone, when I call the name of a business, if you are applying for a permit, come to the podium, speak into the microphone, and tell us your name and your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=166)|
| 0:03:08| That podium's facing the wrong way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=188)|
| 0:03:13| Well, we need the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=193)|
| 0:03:14| Who was the last person speaking at the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=194)|
| 0:03:20| George Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=200)|
| 0:03:29| Looks like a state job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=209)|

| 0:03:43| I'm a supervisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=223)|
| 0:03:44| Okay. Every person has a role in this. Some are turners, and some are supervisors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=224)|

| 0:04:12| Speak up close to the microphone like you're going to have to spit in it or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=252)|
| 0:04:17| My name is Alma McCulley, and our address is 2801 Shod Road. 37912 is our zip code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=257)|

| 0:04:29| We need the building inspection and fire prevention approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=269)|

| 0:05:32| We need building inspection and fire prevention approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=332)|

| 0:05:43| Next is the American Cancer Society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=343)|
| 0:05:46| And Ms. Dyer, am I correct that they are withdrawing their application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=346)|
| 0:05:50| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=350)|
| 0:05:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=351)|
| 0:05:52| This was an interesting case because they are going to have their event at the Mill and Mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=352)|
| 0:05:56| And at the time they were scheduling their application for their permit, Mill and Mine didn't have a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=356)|
| 0:06:03| But now that they do, we can't have two permits at the same address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=363)|
| 0:06:07| So the American Cancer Society was fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=367)|
| 0:06:09| She had not taken the task class, had not done the records check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=369)|
| 0:06:12| So life is good with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=372)|
| 0:06:14| And their gala is coming up, I think it's in August or, I mean, in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=374)|

| 0:07:17| I have a question about this group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=437)|
| 0:07:22| In your compliance plan, you need to have arranged for the security for your event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=442)|
| 0:07:28| Have you actually contacted KPD to get the officers lined up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=448)|
| 0:07:33| We went to the meeting, city meeting, and then I will contact them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=453)|
| 0:07:40| They said a month before, so this week I'm going to contact them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=460)|
| 0:07:44| All right. I encourage you to not drag your feet because there are a lot of events going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=464)|
| 0:07:49| and we have a lot of police officers, but I don't want your event to be shortchanged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=469)|
| 0:07:53| Last year you had it at a different location. Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=473)|
| 0:07:56| Yes, last year it was at Crutch Park, the small park next to Gay Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=476)|
| 0:07:59| but this year it will be at Market Square and Crutch Park, both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=479)|
| 0:08:03| All right. Tell us about your event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=483)|

| 0:08:28| and we added the Kids Asian World, which the kids can come and get a passport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=508)|
| 0:08:34| They don't need to fly. They can come to Market Square and go to Asia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=514)|
| 0:08:39| That's our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=519)|
| 0:08:41| All right. You mentioned the key word, food, and so this immediately got our attention here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=521)|
| 0:08:46| Do I have a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=526)|

| 0:24:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| One minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1486)|
| 0:24:49| Matthew Carter, 11301 Parkside Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1489)|
| 0:24:53| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1493)|
| 0:24:54| I have a question about your plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1494)|
| 0:24:58| You make reference to the cashiers checking the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1498)|
| 0:25:02| Is that the name you also give your servers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1502)|
| 0:25:05| Yes, we don't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1505)|
| 0:25:07| It's not a full-service restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1507)|
| 0:25:08| It's a quick, fast, casual restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1508)|
| 0:25:11| so there is no actual servers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| We have cashiers and food runners, bussers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1513)|
| 0:25:16| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1516)|
| 0:25:22| All right, and you say that all your cashiers will have their ABC cards by the end of July?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1522)|
| 0:25:26| Yes, that is complete already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1526)|
| 0:25:28| Okay, and you've got EGLE giving you an easy date calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1528)|
| 0:25:33| Anything else that will reassure us that this won't happen again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1533)|
| 0:25:38| We've done another checking ID class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| We've gone through the company alcohol responsibility policy with everybody again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1540)|
| 0:25:47| so we're reaching everybody on that and just really pushing it every day to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1547)|
| 0:25:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1552)|
| 0:25:53| If you have turnover in your personnel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1553)|
| 0:25:55| do you have a plan to get them up to speed before they get on the line with the possibility of serving someone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1555)|
| 0:26:03| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1563)|
| 0:26:04| We get full training with the alcohol responsibility policy as well in their first day paperwork to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1564)|
| 0:26:09| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1569)|
| 0:26:13| Do we want to accept their plan and sign and take no further action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1573)|
| 0:26:21| Do we want to send it to the administrative hearing officer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1581)|
| 0:26:24| Thoughts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| Councilman De La Vope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1586)|
| 0:26:27| Could I ask, what you've done now is you've had more training for all the individuals that serve the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1587)|
| 0:26:33| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1593)|
| 0:26:34| Or take the money for selling the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1594)|
| 0:26:37| And how do they act on a given night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1597)|
| 0:26:41| Do you post some kind of a notice that it has to be born before this date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1601)|
| 0:26:47| How do you let them know what's important?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1607)|
| 0:26:49| I've got that notice on every register we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| We also have the quick ID check cards, the layover cards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1611)|
| 0:26:54| so it plays over a tenancy ID that shows all the pertinent information to help with that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1614)|
| 0:27:00| It's like a little template or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1621)|
| 0:27:02| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| With that template in place, I never understand how something could slide through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1624)|
| 0:27:09| but I'm not serving people either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1629)|
| 0:27:12| But anyway, well, good luck with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1632)|
| 0:27:14| And do we vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1634)|
| 0:27:15| Okay, we need to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1635)|
| 0:27:17| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1637)|
| 0:27:18| So this is their second offense in a year, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1638)|
| 0:27:22| So they were cited last June and then again in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1642)|
| 0:27:26| And so they've had a ten-day suspension, and they've been fined $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1646)|
| 0:27:30| Is that what we're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1650)|
| 0:27:31| That's what we're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1651)|
| 0:27:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1652)|
| 0:27:33| So you asked us whether we want to send it to another hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| We want to send it to the administrative hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1658)|
| 0:27:39| No, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1659)|
| 0:27:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1660)|
| 0:27:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1661)|
| 0:27:42| All those in favor of no further action, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1662)|
| 0:27:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1667)|
| 0:27:48| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1668)|
| 0:27:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1669)|
| 0:27:50| We don't ever want to see you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1670)|
| 0:27:51| I don't ever want to come here again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1671)|
| 0:27:52| Unless we're coming there to eat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1672)|
| 0:27:55| Sounds great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1675)|
| 0:27:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1676)|
| 0:27:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1677)|
| 0:27:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1678)|
| 0:27:59| We don't want to see these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1679)|
| 0:28:05| Anything else that anyone has?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1685)|
| 0:28:06| Yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1686)|
| 0:28:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1687)|
| 0:28:08| I have a question, and it came up when the young lady spoke about that she was having dancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1688)|
| 0:28:12| Was there something in the past about if you serve alcohol and have dancing, there's something different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1692)|
| 0:28:17| There is a requirement of a certain amount of square footage for a dance floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1697)|
| 0:28:21| As soon as she mentioned that, actually, you flipped real quick to look at hers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1701)|
| 0:28:24| and she had applied for on-premise with dancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1704)|
| 0:28:28| So she did apply for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1708)|
| 0:28:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1709)|
| 0:28:30| So she must have the right square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1710)|
| 0:28:31| Right, because I think the fire marshal and the police department checked that out, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1711)|
| 0:28:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1715)|
| 0:28:36| Yeah, I actually coordinate with the fire marshal whenever I see that on the list, but they haven't had their inspection yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1716)|
| 0:28:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1722)|
| 0:28:43| But that's one of the things that they look for for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1723)|
| 0:28:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1724)|
| 0:28:45| Well, I thought there was something about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1725)|
| 0:28:46| That's why I wanted to bring it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1726)|
| 0:28:47| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1727)|
| 0:28:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1728)|
| 0:28:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1729)|
| 0:28:50| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1730)|
| 0:28:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1731)|
| 0:28:52| This meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160719?start=1734)|
