| 2:27:08| Our neighborhood's still got an odor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8828)|
| 2:27:10| So I get a petition up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8830)|
| 2:27:12| Take it to the Director of Air Quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8832)|
| 2:27:15| We can't take this petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8835)|
| 2:27:16| All you do is say you've got an odor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8836)|
| 2:27:17| We can't do anything with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8837)|
| 2:27:18| It's got to be subjectable, obnoxious, or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8838)|
| 2:27:21| So I go back and get another petition up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8841)|
| 2:27:24| I take it back to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8844)|
| 2:27:26| Well, we don't know who's in control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8846)|
| 2:27:28| We don't know if we can enforce this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8848)|
| 2:27:30| If it's the Director of Solid Waste, we need 60 days, 60 days later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8850)|
| 2:27:36| Well, we can't actually use this phrase that says if 32 people find it objectionable, we'll correct the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8856)|
| 2:27:47| Or 75% of the people surveyed, we can't use that phrase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8867)|
| 2:27:50| We're going to delete that phrase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8870)|
| 2:27:52| Been there since the inception of the Air Quality Regulations, but now they don't need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8872)|
| 2:27:56| It's not in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8876)|
| 2:27:57| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8877)|
| 2:27:58| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8878)|
| 2:27:59| Who's in charge of Director of Solid Waste?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8879)|
| 2:28:02| Who's in charge of Air Quality?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8882)|
| 2:28:04| Both of those people and departments are aware of our problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8884)|
| 2:28:08| They have not enforced their own regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8888)|
| 2:28:11| TDEC would not enforce their own regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8891)|
| 2:28:14| Yet this place says they want to be a good neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8894)|
| 2:28:16| They want to be as good as a good neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8896)|
| 2:28:18| When they first said they had an odor problem, they sent it to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8898)|
| 2:28:22| Now, when they know they've got an odor problem, they haven't corrected it, but to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8902)|
| 2:28:25| We want to bring in some zoo waste, untreated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8905)|
| 2:28:28| That's no odor problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8908)|
| 2:28:30| We want to bring in grease trappings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8910)|
| 2:28:32| That's no odor problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8912)|
| 2:28:34| We want to bring in feedlot waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8914)|
| 2:28:35| That's no odor problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8915)|
| 2:28:37| We want to bring in bottom ash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8917)|
| 2:28:39| Bottom ash, in case you don't know, contains heavy metals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8919)|
| 2:28:43| They bring it in from two places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8923)|
| 2:28:45| Then you've got human waste being brought in, possibly filled with heavy metals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8925)|
| 2:28:49| I bring that up to TDEC, bring that up to the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8929)|
| 2:28:52| Hey, we're allowed to bring this in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8932)|
| 2:28:54| A year later, TDEC finally goes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8934)|
| 2:28:57| Hey, your heavy metals exceed Tennessee regulations for public sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8937)|
| 2:29:03| For a whole year, they sell this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8943)|
| 2:29:05| But we're good neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8945)|
| 2:29:07| Then the compost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8947)|
| 2:29:08| I don't know if you know anything about compost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8948)|
| 2:29:11| But it sits on the ground and heats to a certain temperature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8951)|
| 2:29:13| They rotate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8953)|
| 2:29:14| After it's reached a certain temperature for so many days, they say it's cured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8954)|
| 2:29:17| At that point, at least 60 percent of the biosolids has degraded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8957)|
| 2:29:22| That leaves 40 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8962)|
| 2:29:24| The chloroform and the polyform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8964)|
| 2:29:29| The biosolids, that's bad for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8969)|
| 2:29:31| I don't know what's the other word, not the chloroform, the fecal count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8971)|
| 2:29:38| All that's supposed to be reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8978)|
| 2:29:39| But they're taking this off the concrete pad at this time, putting it on the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8979)|
| 2:29:45| Hey, I tell them that shouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8985)|
| 2:29:48| Their own TDEC regulation says it's supposed to be on a concrete pad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8988)|
| 2:29:51| I'll call Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8991)|
| 2:29:52| They go back and forth one month on the pad, next month off the pad, next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8992)|
| 2:29:57| Finally, I talk to the director of solid waste in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=8997)|
| 2:30:01| He says, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9001)|
| 2:30:02| It's supposed to be on a concrete pad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9002)|
| 2:30:04| But come June or July or end of June or July, they're going to quit bringing in solid waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9004)|
| 2:30:11| So we don't have a problem right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9011)|
| 2:30:14| They've still got tons and tons of that stuff sitting over on the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9014)|
| 2:30:19| It's coarse ground, which means there's caverns, sinkholes, springs, wells underneath that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9019)|
| 2:30:26| And every time it rains, where does it go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9026)|
| 2:30:30| It has to go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9030)|
| 2:30:32| But, yet, they're good neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9032)|
| 2:30:34| And I'm saying, if any of you guys have got the gall to vote for this company to have the contract for this next mulching facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9034)|
| 2:30:43| I can't believe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9043)|
| 2:30:45| I just can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9045)|
| 2:30:46| I can't believe we have people in this government that sits on the board for NCCR that evaluated this company, gave them good marks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9046)|
| 2:30:55| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9055)|
| 2:30:56| In my opinion, ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9056)|
| 2:30:58| I spent 20 years in the military.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9058)|
| 2:30:59| You have one minute, Mr. Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9059)|
| 2:31:01| Twenty years in the military, ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9061)|
| 2:31:03| I reviewed contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9063)|
| 2:31:04| I wrote contracts, RFPs, all that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9064)|
| 2:31:08| We did it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9068)|
| 2:31:10| If there was even an appearance of an ethical violation, your answer is grass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9070)|
| 2:31:15| But here, hey, what's the big deal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9075)|
| 2:31:18| I sit on this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9078)|
| 2:31:19| I'll review this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9079)|
| 2:31:21| I'll give them good marks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9081)|
| 2:31:22| It don't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9082)|
| 2:31:24| And I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9084)|
| 2:31:27| I've been betrayed by this company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9087)|
| 2:31:31| They told me that I was in the business of mulch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9091)|
| 2:31:34| They told me I wanted them shut down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9094)|
| 2:31:36| I'm not in the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9096)|
| 2:31:37| I don't care if they shut down or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9097)|
| 2:31:38| I want the odor eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9098)|
| 2:31:41| They said that I victimized them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9101)|
| 2:31:43| It's not me victimizing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9103)|
| 2:31:44| It's our community that's been victimized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9104)|
| 2:31:47| They haven't got rid of the odor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9107)|
| 2:31:49| The mayor hasn't assisted us in getting rid of the odor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9109)|
| 2:31:52| Director of Solid Waste hasn't assisted us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9112)|
| 2:31:54| Director of Air Quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9114)|
| 2:31:56| They've all ignored us, more or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9116)|
| 2:31:58| They changed the regulations to suit themselves, and they go about their own business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9118)|
| 2:32:02| I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9122)|
| 2:32:03| But don't vote to give these people the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9123)|
| 2:32:09| Brad Mays, you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9129)|
| 2:32:12| My name is Brad Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9132)|
| 2:32:13| I live at 1817 Plum Branch Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9133)|
| 2:32:16| And I'm just here to say that I'm not related to Len Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9136)|
| 2:32:19| I have made friends with him over the past few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9139)|
| 2:32:22| And he was accused of victimizing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9142)|
| 2:32:26| He was accused of being in the mulch business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9146)|
| 2:32:28| And most recently, the owner of this company called him a conspirator himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9148)|
| 2:32:33| What a way to treat the citizens of this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9153)|
| 2:32:35| Is this the way we do business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9155)|
| 2:32:38| I was also a victim of a similar situation that Ms. DeFreeze knows about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9158)|
| 2:32:43| And that's why I got involved with this, and it had to do with my personal business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9163)|
| 2:32:47| If she wants to ask me about that, I'm more than willing to elaborate and clarify it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9167)|
| 2:32:53| What I came here tonight to talk to you about was an e-mail I received from TDEC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9173)|
| 2:32:58| After last month's meeting, I forwarded some of the lab reports to TDEC that, unfortunately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9178)|
| 2:33:04| this county had not made them aware of as they are required to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9184)|
| 2:33:09| TDEC sent an e-mail to me, and it says the site related, speaking of the Solway site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9189)|
| 2:33:16| based upon the 519.08 analytical results, that product, as your sample,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9196)|
| 2:33:21| was tested on 523.08 by Gerald, Tom Salter, and a health department representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9201)|
| 2:33:29| The data related to me today by Mr. Salter as exceeding the 1,000 fecal coliform number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9209)|
| 2:33:36| The state does not independently sample any SWP or compost or landfill facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9216)|
| 2:33:42| Results must be self-generated and assessed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9222)|
| 2:33:46| The material is to be pulled from the market, as I understand from Mr. Salter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9226)|
| 2:33:51| and that is what the permit language says must occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9231)|
| 2:33:57| Further on in this e-mail, it says the more recent December 07 data was reacted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9237)|
| 2:34:03| by the permit holder when it was related, and I reviewed those tests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9243)|
| 2:34:07| and understand that those piles were pulled off the retail market as well as required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9247)|
| 2:34:13| I called up TDEC and I asked them about the Rodney rocket tests done in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9253)|
| 2:34:20| She also told me that these tests were pulled off the market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9260)|
| 2:34:24| as the state health and safety standards require, has to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9264)|
| 2:34:30| I'd like to also point out to you the May 19th tests had salmonella counts 80 times the EPA approved limit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9270)|
| 2:34:37| in fecal coliform tests, 17 times the EPA limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9277)|
| 2:34:41| I suspect that these tests were probably not turned over to whatever experts were hired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9281)|
| 2:34:47| but I'm going to do a little experiment tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9287)|
| 2:34:52| I've got Rodney Rocket's tests here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9292)|
| 2:34:55| In our depositions, Rodney Rocket is the only man in Knox County who professed to have any knowledge about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9295)|
| 2:35:03| Mr. Salter has zero training in this field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9303)|
| 2:35:07| and Rodney Rocket has actually went to Louisiana State University| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9307)|
| 2:35:11| and received a certificate in this type of an operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9311)|
| 2:35:15| And I feel he's the only Knox County employee adequate to review these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9315)|
| 2:35:20| Now, in his depositions, he said these material tests in March exceeded levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9320)|
| 2:35:25| So I'm going to leave these tests right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9325)|
| 2:35:29| And if Knox County can rely on any tests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9329)|
| 2:35:33| they should be able to rely on the tests that were taken by your own employees on March the 14th and on March the 19th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9333)|
| 2:35:40| employees that are trained in state rule 1200 health and safety standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9340)|
| 2:35:46| Your employee who's trained in this, who's sitting here tonight, Mr. Rodney Rocket, can come here and look at these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9346)|
| 2:35:52| and he can tell you did, in fact, four independent tests of these ten tests run,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9352)|
| 2:35:59| fail the state health and safety standards of rule 1200,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9359)|
| 2:36:03| and were, in fact, pulled off the market because they failed the state health and safety rule 1200 standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9363)|
| 2:36:09| If you can't believe my tests, believe Knox County's tests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9369)|
| 2:36:14| I'm going to leave these here for Mr. Rocket to look at here in a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9374)|
| 2:36:18| and I ask that any one of you commissioners ask him to look at these tests, identify them as the tests he ran,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9378)|
| 2:36:24| and tell you whether or not they met the state health and safety regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9384)|
| 2:36:28| They were ran with E. coli confirmation tests, which is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9388)|
| 2:36:33| During my conversations with the state of Tennessee, I was informed that the reason the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9393)|
| 2:36:39| implicitly states that you have to pass the fecal coliform test is because fecal coliform tests will always catch E. coli contaminated soil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9399)|
| 2:36:50| You have one minute, Mr. Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9410)|
| 2:36:51| Salmonella tests will never catch E. coli contaminated soil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9411)|
| 2:36:57| For those of you who forgot, spinach grown in E. coli contaminated soil killed people all over this country a few years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9417)|
| 2:37:04| The state of Tennessee mandates that fecal coliform tests must be passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9424)|
| 2:37:09| E. coli is a form of fecal coliform, and the E. coli tests alone on some of these products were 630 times higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9429)|
| 2:37:17| than the total fecal count allowed by state regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9437)|
| 2:37:20| and the fecal coliform accounts were 1,000 times higher than the state regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9440)|
| 2:37:25| On the premium double grind tested on March 14th by your own employee, Rodney Rocket,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9445)|
| 2:37:30| with a fecal coliform count of 1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9450)|
| 2:37:33| The state limit is 1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9453)|
| 2:37:35| I'm going to leave these two tests here, and if you all want to ask Mr. Rocket to identify them as his own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9455)|
| 2:37:40| or refute what I'm stating, feel free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9460)|
| 2:37:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9463)|
| 2:37:44| And is there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9464)|
| 2:37:46| We have one more person that wants to speak on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9466)|
| 2:37:49| Thank you, Mr. Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9469)|
| 2:37:51| A.J. Holst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9471)|
| 2:37:55| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9475)|
| 2:37:57| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9477)|
| 2:37:58| I'm A.J. Holst, representing Battles and Battles Tile, 4660 Holston Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9478)|
| 2:38:04| and our newest business venture, which is going to be a wholesale flooring supply company at 4662 Holston Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9484)|
| 2:38:12| This stems from some ongoing issues at an after-hours club called Vic's Place at 4680 Holston Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9492)|
| 2:38:21| I'm here today because of some events of the weekend of June 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9501)|
| 2:38:26| When I arrived to work Monday morning, June 9th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9506)|
| 2:38:31| I had my employees joking around that we would have to start wearing bulletproof vests to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9511)|
| 2:38:38| I said, Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9518)|
| 2:38:40| And they pointed out chalk circles in our parking lot of spent shell casings from a shooting that occurred there the morning of June 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9520)|
| 2:38:53| In addition to that, the new library that is over on Asheville Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9533)|
| 2:39:02| apparently PBA is going to have to go out there and repair some bullet holes in the side of that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9542)|
| 2:39:09| The criminal analysis report that we received from the Knoxville Police Department as a result of 911 calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9549)|
| 2:39:17| indicates that in 2006, there were 24 911 calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9557)|
| 2:39:23| In 2007, there were 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9563)|
| 2:39:26| And in 2008 through June 14th, there have been 47 911 calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9566)|
| 2:39:33| This is a club that is only open Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9573)|
| 2:39:38| It is obviously getting worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9578)|
| 2:39:41| It's not getting better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9581)|
| 2:39:44| Beyond just disturbance for drunkenness and loud partying, fights, assaults, domestic calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9584)|
| 2:39:54| there have been three shootings this year and a carjacking just for kicks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9594)|
| 2:40:02| When the police department responds for the safety of their officers, three to five patrol cars have to show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9602)|
| 2:40:11| When they show up, who is patrolling the rest of East Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9611)|
| 2:40:17| Nobody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9617)|
| 2:40:18| And they're there for two to four hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9618)|
| 2:40:22| This place is an obvious public safety hazard, and we're tired of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9622)|
| 2:40:30| And we don't know why this business is still in operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9630)|
| 2:40:34| The owner simply states to the police department that he has no control over what goes on in the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9634)|
| 2:40:44| He is only responsible for what happens inside the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9644)|
| 2:40:49| Why are they in business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9649)|
| 2:40:51| Can this body determine that this is a public safety hazard and close them down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9651)|
| 2:41:01| Yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9661)|
| 2:41:02| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9662)|
| 2:41:03| Are you finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9663)|
| 2:41:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9664)|
| 2:41:06| Do you have questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9666)|
| 2:41:08| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9668)|
| 2:41:09| Yes, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9669)|
| 2:41:10| You said you called the Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9670)|
| 2:41:14| Is this in the city or is this in the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9674)|
| 2:41:17| I believe it's in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9677)|
| 2:41:19| Is it in the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9679)|
| 2:41:20| I just have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9680)|
| 2:41:21| I don't know if the law director is still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9681)|
| 2:41:23| Do we have jurisdiction over things in the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9683)|
| 2:41:25| No, he's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9685)|
| 2:41:27| Well, the sheriff would have jurisdiction because the county is in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9687)|
| 2:41:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9689)|
| 2:41:30| I'll be glad to call Sheriff Jones and see if he can help you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9690)|
| 2:41:36| But priority, it's a city police department issue, but the county sheriff has to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9696)|
| 2:41:41| Well, here's the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9701)|
| 2:41:42| The city cannot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9702)|
| 2:41:43| They can only do as much as the law allows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9703)|
| 2:41:47| At this point, you know, they can show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9707)|
| 2:41:50| They can confiscate guns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9710)|
| 2:41:51| They can make arrests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9711)|
| 2:41:53| But the business continues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9713)|
| 2:41:57| If you'll give me your name and your phone number, I'll be glad to have the sheriff give you a call and see if you all can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9717)|
| 2:42:03| Well, we've been in contact with Chief Owens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9723)|
| 2:42:08| I wish I could have some of the officers that have to respond to this place on the weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9728)|
| 2:42:16| It's unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9736)|
| 2:42:19| We have spent to revitalize East Knoxville and bring business to East Knox County with hundreds of thousands of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9739)|
| 2:42:29| to improve the property by inventory, increase property values, and bring sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9749)|
| 2:42:36| And we're sitting here and have been advised by the police department that work through county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9756)|
| 2:42:46| work through the city commission, work through the health department, work through the fire department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9766)|
| 2:42:52| work through the codes department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9772)|
| 2:42:54| So here I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9774)|
| 2:42:57| Let me say, I've been out to your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9777)|
| 2:43:01| Very nice establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9781)|
| 2:43:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9783)|
| 2:43:04| And I did call you or your partner the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9784)|
| 2:43:07| Mr. Battles, Robert, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9787)|
| 2:43:09| It doesn't sound like it, but anyway, I'm very familiar with the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9789)|
| 2:43:14| And I would like to say that the city of Knoxville and the police department are doing something to take care of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9794)|
| 2:43:21| hopefully, the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9801)|
| 2:43:24| And I've had a lot of discussion with Chief Owens and the mayor about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9804)|
| 2:43:30| And it is a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9810)|
| 2:43:32| But something is on the horizon that hopefully will take care of all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9812)|
| 2:43:36| And the police do sit across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9816)|
| 2:43:38| They don't do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9818)|
| 2:43:39| Then when they leave, something happens after night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9819)|
| 2:43:44| And the police department, every time we contact them, they're right there, very cooperative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9824)|
| 2:43:51| And sometimes they do stay there for a while, but nothing happens when they're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9831)|
| 2:43:55| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9835)|
| 2:43:57| Is that a blighted area, Tony?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9837)|
| 2:43:59| No, it's not blighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9839)|
| 2:44:00| We're a mile from Holston Hills Golf Course, one of the premier golf courses in the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9840)|
| 2:44:07| The police is directly behind the East Knoxville Library, directly behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9847)|
| 2:44:11| Brand-new library, got bullet holes in the back of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9851)|
| 2:44:13| So don't get rid of PBA just yet until you get them to fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9853)|
| 2:44:19| It's closed tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9859)|
| 2:44:20| He said it's open during weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9860)|
| 2:44:22| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9862)|
| 2:44:23| I just have another question in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9863)|
| 2:44:25| Is there anything that we or the city council can do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9865)|
| 2:44:29| I assume there's liquor sold there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9869)|
| 2:44:31| No, just beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9871)|
| 2:44:33| It's an after-hours club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9873)|
| 2:44:35| And what happens after 3 o'clock is everybody continues the party over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9875)|
| 2:44:41| When we show up at our business at 6 and 7 o'clock in the morning, they're still going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9881)|
| 2:44:47| And when I have to be concerned about the safety of my employees and my customers, that's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9887)|
| 2:44:55| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9895)|
| 2:44:56| Is there anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9896)|
| 2:44:57| The city is working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9897)|
| 2:44:59| And, again, if we can deem it, again, advice from some officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9899)|
| 2:45:04| If it is a public hazard, a hazard to public safety, you know, we have some leg to stand on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9904)|
| 2:45:12| One thing is the restaurant, they sell more food than they do beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9912)|
| 2:45:18| And that's a ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9918)|
| 2:45:20| I'm sorry, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9920)|
| 2:45:22| I have talked to Officer Husky and I operated a small restaurant chain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9922)|
| 2:45:29| I'm at my business from 7 o'clock in the morning until 6 o'clock at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9929)|
| 2:45:34| And for all the food that they purportedly sell, I've yet to see a food truck make a delivery Monday through Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9934)|
| 2:45:40| They sell a lot of food, trust me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9940)|
| 2:45:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9942)|
| 2:45:43| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9943)|
| 2:45:45| Yeah, I just wanted to say, just like the chairman said, we don't have regulatory authority over this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9945)|
| 2:45:51| but I will be talking to my friends that are on city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9951)|
| 2:45:55| And just like my parents said when I was young, I didn't believe them then, but I've come to realize they were right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9955)|
| 2:46:01| There's nothing but trouble to get in after hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9961)|
| 2:46:04| And I just wanted to make it clear to any of the citizens of my district, we have a Vicks out in our district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9964)|
| 2:46:10| It's an upscale liquor store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9970)|
| 2:46:14| This is not in any way associated with that, I don't believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9974)|
| 2:46:17| This is an after hours club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9977)|
| 2:46:19| And, frankly, I think we need some sort of an ordinance to shut down all the after hours clubs because there's nothing but trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9979)|
| 2:46:26| Commissioner Moore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9986)|
| 2:46:29| I've got a separate question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9989)|
| 2:46:31| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9991)|
| 2:46:32| No, I mean whenever we're done with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9992)|
| 2:46:36| Does anyone have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9996)|
| 2:46:37| I just had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9997)|
| 2:46:38| I asked him if he had been to the city beer board and complained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=9998)|
| 2:46:41| They're investigating and, again, they're pretty slick operators and know exactly what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10001)|
| 2:46:48| The city is taking care of it, Ivan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10008)|
| 2:46:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10010)|
| 2:46:51| You're going to handle it, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10011)|
| 2:46:52| I'm not handling it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10012)|
| 2:46:53| Well, I know I served on the city beer board and they will appeal their license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10013)|
| 2:46:57| So if you keep complaining, they'll get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10017)|
| 2:47:00| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10020)|
| 2:47:02| I don't want him to come forward, but who's Rodney Rocket?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10022)|
| 2:47:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10029)|
| 2:47:10| And that's your real name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10030)|
| 2:47:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10033)|
| 2:47:14| Like Flash Gordon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10034)|
| 2:47:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10035)|
| 2:47:16| I just wanted to make sure because he's saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10036)|
| 2:47:18| I don't want you to come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10038)|
| 2:47:19| I just want to know who you were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10039)|
| 2:47:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10040)|
| 2:47:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10041)|
| 2:47:22| We need to hear from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10042)|
| 2:47:24| Commissioner Moore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10044)|
| 2:47:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10045)|
| 2:47:26| I think, Rodney, if you want to come and look at that and just. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10046)|
| 2:47:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10049)|
| 2:47:30| I mean there's been an allegation made if you can because I think Dr. Briggs asked last month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10050)|
| 2:47:35| or the month before to see if any of this product was sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10055)|
| 2:47:40| Was it public in any kind of danger?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10060)|
| 2:47:45| And I don't know, Commissioner Briggs, did you ever get that answer from. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10065)|
| 2:47:51| I will look at these and I'll be happy to answer questions regarding this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10071)|
| 2:47:54| I'd like to defer to Tom Salter to. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10074)|
| 2:47:58| Well, I think everybody's getting worn out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10078)|
| 2:48:00| but I would like to make sure that you answer those two questions that Mr. Mays had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10080)|
| 2:48:05| and if Dr. Briggs could get an answer from Mark Jones or somebody about the public health issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10085)|
| 2:48:11| I think he asked for it last month or the month before, so just so we can let the public know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10091)|
| 2:48:16| Let me start on Rodney's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10096)|
| 2:48:18| I'm Tom Salter, Solid Waste Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10098)|
| 2:48:20| Earlier this month you got a binder about an inch thick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10100)|
| 2:48:23| Tab five addresses all of the testing that took place in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10103)|
| 2:48:29| One of the things that I've learned in this process. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10109)|
| 2:48:32| I want to apologize for not knowing everything on the first day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10112)|
| 2:48:36| but I've learned a lot since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10116)|
| 2:48:40| In our process, we're regulated by TDEC and EPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10120)|
| 2:48:43| There is somebody watching the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10123)|
| 2:48:45| We're watching the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10125)|
| 2:48:47| And the way our material goes through, it is processed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10127)|
| 2:48:51| Lynn Mays was incorrect when it goes through the heating process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10131)|
| 2:48:55| The material, the pathogens in the biosolids are destroyed to a level that TDEC says they can be released for sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10135)|
| 2:49:07| or given away without restriction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10147)|
| 2:49:09| It's not a 60% reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10149)|
| 2:49:12| It's 100% destruction of those biosolids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10152)|
| 2:49:17| And then we keep the material. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10157)|
| 2:49:18| We let it cure for another three to six months, and that's when we test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10158)|
| 2:49:23| All the material that's ever left that facility has passed the fecal coliform and salmonella tests at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10163)|
| 2:49:32| Now subsequent to that, the material is mixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10172)|
| 2:49:35| It's set out for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10175)|
| 2:49:37| And it can change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10177)|
| 2:49:42| Our experts call these surface anomalies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10182)|
| 2:49:44| And I liken it to if you wash your car and you leave it outside for a month and there's no rain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10184)|
| 2:49:50| there's going to be stuff on your car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10190)|
| 2:49:53| And that's what happens to our compost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10193)|
| 2:49:56| That's why the testing regimen is very, very strict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10196)|
| 2:49:59| And I think if you all saw this letter I gave out, I think, at the committee meetings, our response to the Don Bosch letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10199)|
| 2:50:08| we talked about the testing regimen for this material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10208)|
| 2:50:12| And the last time we used this regimen, everything we test had nondetectable levels of fecal coliform and salmonella.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10212)|
| 2:50:21| And for Mr. May's comfort and benefit, Rodney Rockets supervised all of those tests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10221)|
| 2:50:28| And I'm willing to stand behind this material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10228)|
| 2:50:31| And I know that Rodney will stand behind the quality of this material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10231)|
| 2:50:36| But because the material is exposed, after it goes through the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10236)|
| 2:50:42| the regulators make accommodations for failed tests later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10242)|
| 2:50:49| It's possible for there to be regrowth of organisms on this material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10249)|
| 2:50:54| And we've always followed those regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10254)|
| 2:50:56| In fact, we had a meeting with TDEC two weeks ago regarding this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10256)|
| 2:51:01| And we've never been issued a violation from EPA or TDEC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10261)|
| 2:51:06| And the reason is they say when an issue is raised at commission, our contractor or our staff goes out and deals with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10266)|
| 2:51:14| And we do what we're supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10274)|
| 2:51:16| And by the time the test results get delivered to TDEC, we've already acted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10276)|
| 2:51:22| So these tests are being pulled, which are not recognized tests by TDEC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10282)|
| 2:51:29| And they're waved around down here at commission, and we react to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10289)|
| 2:51:33| And we do what we're supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10293)|
| 2:51:36| And sometimes you get an elevated level and you have to pull the material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10296)|
| 2:51:41| Our consultant also said if there is some regulated material that has an elevated level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10301)|
| 2:51:51| and it does go out for sale for a few days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10311)|
| 2:51:55| the potential risk of a health hazard is extremely low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10315)|
| 2:52:02| This is not like spraying farm pond water on spinach that's then not washed and then sold to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10322)|
| 2:52:11| This is like soil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10331)|
| 2:52:13| And if you want to talk to some reps from the health department and some others, they can address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10333)|
| 2:52:20| But we stand behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10340)|
| 2:52:22| We're following the regulations out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10342)|
| 2:52:25| And there's no public health risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10345)|
| 2:52:28| Would you have this on your yard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10348)|
| 2:52:31| I do have it on my yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10351)|
| 2:52:33| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10353)|
| 2:52:34| Let me mention one thing about casual contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10354)|
| 2:52:37| Our consultant told us that a child under five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10357)|
| 2:52:42| or a person with a compromised immune system would have to eat more than a pound of compost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10362)|
| 2:52:48| I know that Mr. Mays gave a speech several months ago about a child playing in mulch looking for Easter eggs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10368)|
| 2:52:56| and then becoming sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10376)|
| 2:52:58| We contacted US EPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10378)|
| 2:53:01| We contacted the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10381)|
| 2:53:03| And there's no record of anyone getting sick from compost or mulch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10383)|
| 2:53:10| We haven't found any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10390)|
| 2:53:12| And the regulations, the way the material is treated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10392)|
| 2:53:15| the regulations address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10395)|
| 2:53:20| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10400)|
| 2:53:21| I asked a question, I believe it was a month ago at this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10401)|
| 2:53:26| Are we following the regulations and is the product safe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10406)|
| 2:53:33| We are following the regulations and the product is safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10413)|
| 2:53:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10416)|
| 2:53:37| Commissioner Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10417)|
| 2:53:39| Tom, I know we've stopped taking biosolids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10419)|
| 2:53:42| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10422)|
| 2:53:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10424)|
| 2:53:45| I don't think we're stopping until June 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10425)|
| 2:53:47| The contractor may have stopped, but we're stopping on June 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10427)|
| 2:53:52| Have we stopped?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10432)|
| 2:53:54| We stopped on June 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10434)|
| 2:53:58| And that was by a mutual agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10438)|
| 2:54:00| How many tons of this do we have left out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10440)|
| 2:54:03| Quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10443)|
| 2:54:05| But I will say, I don't know, I don't know the amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10445)|
| 2:54:08| but I will say that it takes four to six weeks for it to go through that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10448)|
| 2:54:13| initial heating process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10453)|
| 2:54:15| And after that, according to TDEC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10455)|
| 2:54:17| this material can be given away or sold without restriction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10457)|
| 2:54:20| So in terms of a safety issue, it's going to be managed into a safe condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10460)|
| 2:54:27| and then it will be mixed with other products and sold, just as it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10467)|
| 2:54:32| Commissioner Roundtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10472)|
| 2:54:35| Mr. Commissioner, I'm tired, and I'd like to make a motion that we adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10475)|
| 2:54:42| What did you want to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080623part2?start=10482)|
