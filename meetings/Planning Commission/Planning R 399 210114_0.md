| 0:17:22| This will require three separate motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1042)|
| 0:17:26| We have two reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1046)|
| 0:17:27| One is the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1047)|
| 0:17:30| The other is the one-year plan amendment and rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1050)|
| 0:17:33| Applicant is Ben Mullins on behalf of Nancy Ziegler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1053)|
| 0:17:37| Location, west of Plenty Grove Church Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1057)|
| 0:17:40| north of Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1060)|
| 0:17:43| Property currently zoning MDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1063)|
| 0:17:46| medium density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1066)|
| 0:17:48| RN3 general residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1068)|
| 0:17:51| Request is MDRO, medium density residential office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1071)|
| 0:17:57| Staff recommendation on the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| is approved medium density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| because it is consistent with the surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1083)|
| 0:18:07| Is Mr. Mullins present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1087)|
| 0:18:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1093)|
| 0:18:18| Nick, is Mr. Mullins available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1098)|
| 0:18:21| Yeah, he's being promoted to panelist right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1101)|
| 0:18:24| Mr. Mullins, are you available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1104)|
| 0:18:26| I am, I just now got the option to join in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1106)|
| 0:18:28| Can you hear me now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1108)|
| 0:18:29| We can hear you fine, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1109)|
| 0:18:31| Would you like to proceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1111)|
| 0:18:32| or would you like the opposition to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1112)|
| 0:18:37| Is there anybody signed up to speak in opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1117)|
| 0:18:40| Mr. Mullins, I don't believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1120)|
| 0:18:43| I didn't think so either, so I was just making sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| I'll just briefly, we agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1126)|
| 0:18:49| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street, suite 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1129)|
| 0:18:53| We agree with staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1133)|
| 0:18:57| This is one that I have been working with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1137)|
| 0:19:00| There was a letter from Mr. Newman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1140)|
| 0:19:03| from the adjacent residential neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1143)|
| 0:19:07| with some concerns about some foot traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1147)|
| 0:19:10| Was talking with him about the foot traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1150)|
| 0:19:13| is actually not from our property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1153)|
| 0:19:15| but from another property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1155)|
| 0:19:16| He was just concerned about once our property is developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1156)|
| 0:19:20| which he does not have an objection to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1160)|
| 0:19:22| if there would be a way that we could address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1162)|
| 0:19:24| And we told him we would continue to talk to him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| and work with him about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1166)|
| 0:19:28| I've also spoken with Councilwoman Singh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1168)|
| 0:19:31| who is the council representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1171)|
| 0:19:35| for the city council in this district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1175)|
| 0:19:36| And she's not in opposition of this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1176)|
| 0:19:39| It's a prior zoning equivalent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1179)|
| 0:19:41| Previously, they would be allowed to do multifamily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1181)|
| 0:19:46| as of right, as a permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1186)|
| 0:19:48| And the RN-5 further would allow them to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1188)|
| 0:19:52| under the city's new zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1192)|
| 0:19:54| So it is the most equivalent zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1194)|
| 0:19:57| The sector plan and the one-year plan amendment are required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1197)|
| 0:20:01| because they removed RN-5 from the MDR designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1201)|
| 0:20:07| and so we would need to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1207)|
| 0:20:10| a different sector plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1210)|
| 0:20:12| but there have been other plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1212)|
| 0:20:14| amendments in that area that have been approved as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1214)|
| 0:20:16| So we think this puts them in the best position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1216)|
| 0:20:19| the same position they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1219)|
| 0:20:20| before the new zoning ordinance went into place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1220)|
| 0:20:23| and we'd ask commission to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1223)|
| 0:20:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1226)|
| 0:20:31| Chair will recognize Commissioner Korbelek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1231)|
| 0:20:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1236)|
| 0:20:37| A simple question to staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1237)|
| 0:20:39| Given the nature of the applications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1239)|
| 0:20:41| even if we wanted to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1241)|
| 0:20:42| we wouldn't be able to place a condition on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1242)|
| 0:20:46| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1246)|
| 0:20:48| This is staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1248)|
| 0:20:49| This is Liz Albertson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1249)|

| 0:26:37| which is currently a car care and muffler shop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1597)|
| 0:26:40| into two complimentary businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1600)|
| 0:26:43| a Scooter's Coffee and a Take 5 oil change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1603)|
| 0:26:48| After meeting with staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1608)|
| 0:26:49| and discussing the new zoning ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1609)|
| 0:26:54| scheme to have the CH1 being north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1614)|
| 0:26:59| of Kingston Pike, that location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1619)|
| 0:27:02| the CG zoning being south of Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1622)|
| 0:27:06| and then, of course, when you get beyond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1626)|
| 0:27:10| south of Ramirez Boulevard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| there is some residential development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1632)|
| 0:27:13| and wanting to maintain that step down scheme of zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1633)|
| 0:27:18| They looked at what they could do with the CG3 zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1638)|
| 0:27:21| and the issue with the CG3 zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1641)|
| 0:27:24| is the combination of the setbacks for the front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1644)|
| 0:27:29| and the corner side and the required build to percentage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1649)|
| 0:27:36| zones that are required for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1656)|
| 0:27:38| would not allow them to develop the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| in the manner that they had intended to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1660)|
| 0:27:45| After speaking with staff and going through their options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1665)|
| 0:27:48| CG1 is consistent with the one-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1668)|
| 0:27:52| and the sector plan in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1672)|
| 0:27:53| and it would allow them to build two smaller buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1673)|
| 0:27:58| towards the center of this lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| and not as close to either Winston or Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1680)|
| 0:28:06| And so that is what they amended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| their application to ask for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1688)|
| 0:28:11| They have also already filed for a special use permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1691)|
| 0:28:15| with the plans for this being laid out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1695)|
| 0:28:19| as to what they want to do with the design elements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1699)|
| 0:28:22| with the dedication of sidewalk frontage on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| They've already talked to TDOT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| about where there's an open curb cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1708)|
| 0:28:31| Now that curb cut would not allow to continue to be open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1711)|
| 0:28:34| There would be only a single curb cut along Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| And so they know where the location of that can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1716)|
| 0:28:39| And we've already gone through a development review process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1719)|
| 0:28:41| with staff with regard to this site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1721)|
| 0:28:45| I did upload that site plan today as my comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1725)|
| 0:28:49| so you can look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1729)|
| 0:28:53| The applicant is going to be an owner operator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1733)|
| 0:28:55| of these two franchises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1735)|
| 0:28:57| This is the first Scooters location in the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1737)|
| 0:29:00| and the first Take Five location in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1740)|
| 0:29:04| I think there are some locations in Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| And I understand the concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1747)|
| 0:29:11| about the lack of design standards for the CG-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1751)|
| 0:29:15| I think the, I don't want to set a precedent with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1755)|
| 0:29:18| I think we need to look at these on a case-by-case basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1758)|
| 0:29:22| because there is a reason for asking for the CG-1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1762)|
| 0:29:26| other than we just don't want the design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| I think most of the design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1768)|
| 0:29:31| are going to be addressed in the special use application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1771)|
| 0:29:34| which is already being applied for here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1774)|
| 0:29:39| Oftentimes you'll hear developers say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| they don't want to submit a site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| They don't want to do a traffic impact analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1783)|
| 0:29:45| or any traffic impact letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1785)|
| 0:29:47| until they know they have the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| because they don't want to spend the money for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1789)|
| 0:29:50| Here, we've already done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| We've already submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1792)|
| 0:29:53| for a traffic impact analysis letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1793)|
| 0:29:54| and then you actually have that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1794)|
| 0:29:59| So I think the concerns can be addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1799)|
| 0:30:01| in the special use process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1801)|
| 0:30:03| which distinguishes this from some of the concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| that staff raised, I believe, during the agenda review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1805)|
| 0:30:09| And as part of the, during this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1809)|
| 0:30:12| there was another zoning that actually asked for office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1812)|
| 0:30:16| to CG-1 along Asheville Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| for the old Holiday Inn property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1818)|
| 0:30:21| And these issues came up in conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1821)|
| 0:30:23| with city council then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1823)|
| 0:30:24| And I hope you had a chance to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1824)|
| 0:30:26| I know it was an hour long conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| but I did link in my submittals to that conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1828)|
| 0:30:31| because it wasn't just the design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| that was an issue, although that was certainly discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1834)|
| 0:30:37| It was the fact that there would be no further public input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1837)|
| 0:30:41| in the process for that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1841)|
| 0:30:43| And that it would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1843)|
| 0:30:45| I think the term was behind the curtain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| That won't be an issue here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1847)|
| 0:30:51| I think we can address the concerns that staff has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1851)|
| 0:30:55| and some of the concerns that were addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1855)|
| 0:30:57| at the agenda review and still find a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1857)|
| 0:31:00| to allow this property, which is very small,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1860)|
| 0:31:02| it's very hard to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| It's underdeveloped now with the car care muffler shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1864)|
| 0:31:08| It doesn't meet the standards that are in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| for the zoning currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1870)|
| 0:31:12| Excuse me, Mr. Mullins, your five minutes is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1872)|
| 0:31:16| Can you wrap it up real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1876)|
| 0:31:18| I know Mr. Harris and Mr. Stone are also joined us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1878)|
| 0:31:23| and they are part of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1883)|
| 0:31:27| Absolutely, they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1887)|
| 0:31:28| And I would say just the concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1888)|
| 0:31:30| that were raised previously are different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1890)|
| 0:31:31| This is an adjacent to residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1891)|
| 0:31:35| With the CG3, you could build right up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1895)|
| 0:31:38| on the first street frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1898)|
| 0:31:41| for both Kingston Pike and Winston| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1901)|
| 0:31:42| and put a 250 foot building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1902)|
| 0:31:44| Here, we're asking for a lot lesser intensive development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1904)|
| 0:31:49| for a company that's gonna be invested in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1909)|
| 0:31:52| and be an owner operator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1912)|
| 0:31:53| So we would ask that since it's consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1913)|
| 0:31:56| with the one-year plan and the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1916)|
| 0:31:57| you grant the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| Thank you, Mr. Harris and Mr. Stone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1919)|
| 0:32:02| do you have anything else you wanna add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1922)|
| 0:32:03| besides what Mr. Mullins has already spoken about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1923)|
| 0:32:06| No, I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1926)|
| 0:32:09| Yeah, just on a personal note,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1929)|
| 0:32:13| my wife and I, we're gonna be the operator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1933)|
| 0:32:16| of the Scooters franchise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| and we're excited to start our new business on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1938)|
| 0:32:22| Kingston Pike is a very desirable location, as we all know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1942)|
| 0:32:26| And with our concept, it's a 600 square foot building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1946)|
| 0:32:31| so a very small footprint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1951)|
| 0:32:33| but it requires land to be able to put it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| And as we know, Kingston Pike is already very developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1956)|
| 0:32:39| This is one area that we find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| that we can improve the aesthetics of the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1961)|
| 0:32:44| and provide a great service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1964)|
| 0:32:46| With residential being nearby,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1966)|
| 0:32:49| coffee is always a desired need for folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1969)|
| 0:32:54| So we feel like we'll be a great asset to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1974)|
| 0:32:57| and we'll be also looking to further grow our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1977)|
| 0:33:02| But this would be the cornerstone of our business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1982)|
| 0:33:05| and it would be very much welcome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1985)|
| 0:33:08| if we could receive this exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1988)|
| 0:33:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1991)|
| 0:33:12| Thank you, Mr. Harris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1992)|
| 0:33:13| I will open the floor to comments from the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1993)|
| 0:33:17| Mr. Commissioner Hill, you have your hand raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=1997)|
| 0:33:21| Thank you, Chair Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2001)|
| 0:33:24| I had quite a bit to say about this at the agenda review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2004)|
| 0:33:27| and I think that much of my efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2007)|
| 0:33:30| were in an attempt to promote the new zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2010)|
| 0:33:35| which I feel is a very good zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2015)|
| 0:33:38| We certainly need some revisions to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2018)|
| 0:33:41| but it's far better than what we had in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2021)|
| 0:33:45| There were a couple of things about this once,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| well, I also enjoyed debating Commissioner Roth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2027)|
| 0:33:51| and that may have precipitated much of my comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2031)|
| 0:33:55| But one, I think we do need to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2035)|
| 0:33:58| this zoning ordinance because I'm pretty sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| that we did notify all of the residents in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2042)|
| 0:34:07| about this recode effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2047)|
| 0:34:10| But the reason I am now in favor of CG1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2050)|
| 0:34:17| is because I started looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2057)|
| 0:34:19| at this stretch of Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2059)|
| 0:34:22| and I said, where would be considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2062)|
| 0:34:25| the most probably walkable environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2065)|
| 0:34:31| and then look at the zoning accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| Also, I wanna say I have all the confidence in our staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2073)|
| 0:34:36| and 99% of the time I support their recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2076)|
| 0:34:41| However, I differ on this one now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| and I hope you'll listen closely to the facts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2083)|
| 0:34:48| that I weighed heavily to change my decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2088)|
| 0:34:51| And it's a hard thing to change your mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2091)|
| 0:34:53| but I started off with the purpose statements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2093)|
| 0:34:57| in the new zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| and I just wanna take a little excerpt out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| It said CG is designed to promote mixed use development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2101)|
| 0:35:07| in a pedestrian oriented environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2107)|
| 0:35:09| that recalls the city's traditional business district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2109)|
| 0:35:15| Well, when you think about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| it wants to promote that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2117)|
| 0:35:19| in a pedestrian oriented environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2119)|
| 0:35:23| I'm not sure we have a pedestrian oriented environment here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2123)|
| 0:35:28| So I went to the heart of what I would consider Bearden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2128)|
| 0:35:32| and I looked at intersections such as Northwest Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2132)|
| 0:35:37| Chambliss Street, Sutherland and Westwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2137)|
| 0:35:42| You have CG1 on a two lane street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2142)|
| 0:35:47| directly across from R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2147)|
| 0:35:51| And I think the intent of CG| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2151)|
| 0:35:54| was to add a lot of flexibility to the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2154)|
| 0:35:58| and not so much restrict the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2158)|
| 0:36:01| And in this case, because of we're competing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| with anybody trying to cross the Kingston Pike here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2165)|
| 0:36:11| you're putting your life in peril.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| Yes, my desire is to see something better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| but I don't want my decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2176)|
| 0:36:19| I don't want my desire to override| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2179)|
| 0:36:21| what I think is a fair and equitable decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2181)|
| 0:36:24| And the other thing about CG3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2184)|
| 0:36:29| and we need to look at, the market's changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2189)|
| 0:36:35| There is a market for drive-thrus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| and yes, it is a special use in CG3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2197)|
| 0:36:42| but when you force them up zero to 20 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2202)|
| 0:36:47| it's very difficult to make a drive-thru work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2207)|
| 0:36:51| And the last thing I wanna say about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| is I think when we start tweaking the new zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2213)|
| 0:36:57| I would ask staff to look at adding some design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2217)|
| 0:37:03| to CG1 and I just don't remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2223)|
| 0:37:07| why we didn't do that in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2227)|
| 0:37:09| but I couldn't find any building design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2229)|
| 0:37:15| and maybe we ought to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| But that's a lot to be said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| but I felt like I owed the explanation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| because of the comments I made on Tuesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| but I would certainly be in favor of this CG1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2243)|
| 0:37:27| in this particular instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2249)|
| 0:37:30| Thank you, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| Chair recognizes Commissioner Korbelik.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2252)|
| 0:37:36| Yes, thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2256)|
| 0:37:37| I'm quite familiar with the concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2257)|
| 0:37:41| expressed by the East Knoxville community on the CG1 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2261)|
| 0:37:47| And the takeaway from that is that for some reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2267)|
| 0:37:52| the failure to apply design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| to that zone was an oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2274)|
| 0:37:58| I've driven this portion of Kingston| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2278)|
| 0:38:01| and it has more of a design feature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2281)|
| 0:38:05| than some other aspects of Kingston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2285)|
| 0:38:08| And I would like to see us to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2288)|
| 0:38:09| to promote that direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2289)|
| 0:38:12| by following the staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| to deny the CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2295)|
| 0:38:19| Chair recognizes Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2299)|
| 0:38:27| Sorry, I'm just wondering if we have received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2307)|
| 0:38:32| could quickly look at the attachment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2312)|
| 0:38:35| that Mr. Mullins posted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2315)|
| 0:38:38| but it looks like it came in literally today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| It's quite lengthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2320)|
| 0:38:42| I know that I have not had the ability to digest it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2322)|
| 0:38:47| Is this a circumstance where we should consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2327)|
| 0:38:50| a postponement so that we can review that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2330)|
| 0:38:53| Or a separate question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2333)|
| 0:38:56| Mr. Mullins referred to a great amount of information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2336)|
| 0:39:00| that is being provided that would come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2340)|
| 0:39:02| in the use on review, but that's later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2342)|
| 0:39:07| Is that also complicating this case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2347)|
| 0:39:13| Commissioner Adams, if I can address that quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2353)|
| 0:39:18| I was having trouble uploading information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2358)|
| 0:39:21| through the new side or still learning curve with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2361)|
| 0:39:25| I did, and at least it was showing up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2365)|
| 0:39:28| on my attachments to the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2368)|
| 0:39:29| upload my letter, my January 11th letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2369)|
| 0:39:34| on Monday before agenda review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2374)|
| 0:39:37| I don't know if that got pushed out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| to the individual commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2379)|
| 0:39:40| I did feel like based upon some of the comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| and conversations that the individual commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2382)|
| 0:39:45| hadn't had a chance to review that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2385)|
| 0:39:47| because it did address some of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2387)|
| 0:39:49| that staff was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2389)|
| 0:39:50| I know staff commented on our position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2390)|
| 0:39:54| So I know they had seen it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2394)|
| 0:39:55| and I hope you all did have an opportunity to review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2395)|
| 0:39:59| I tried to give the best thumbnail I could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| in the five minutes that I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2401)|
| 0:40:02| but there is a lot here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2402)|
| 0:40:06| As far as the postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2406)|
| 0:40:08| because of the special use application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| we've already filed the special use application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| It was on the automatic postponement list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2412)|
| 0:40:14| that was just approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2414)|
| 0:40:15| It can't get heard until at least this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2415)|
| 0:40:19| has decided on this zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2419)|
| 0:40:22| It can be considered or go through the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| while city council is then looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2424)|
| 0:40:27| But we are taking the risk that all that effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2427)|
| 0:40:30| with the design, with the application fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2430)|
| 0:40:32| with the traffic impact would be for naught| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2432)|
| 0:40:35| if this zoning isn't approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2435)|
| 0:40:37| But we felt strongly enough about this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2437)|
| 0:40:41| and actually wanting to do this design aspect for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2441)|
| 0:40:44| that we wanted to go ahead and take that risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2444)|
| 0:40:47| So I think we would like a positive recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2447)|
| 0:40:52| to city council today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| I don't have any problems conceptually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2454)|
| 0:40:57| with design standards for the CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| I think it probably should be added and should be considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2459)|
| 0:41:02| that doesn't necessarily affect our development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2462)|
| 0:41:05| because we're moving forward with a special use application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2465)|
| 0:41:08| and I believe addresses most of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2468)|
| 0:41:11| When you come with a national franchise business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2471)|
| 0:41:15| a Scooters Coffee, a Take Five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| well, they have their own design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2477)|
| 0:41:20| They're building their logos, that's all marketing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2480)|
| 0:41:23| to design to appeal to their customer base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2483)|
| 0:41:26| And so I think that this is a circumstance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2486)|
| 0:41:29| where the market matches up with the design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2489)|
| 0:41:32| that one would want to have in CG1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2492)|
| 0:41:35| that just currently isn't here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| Thank you, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2497)|
| 0:41:40| Sorry, Mr. Phillips, may I respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2500)|
| 0:41:43| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| The very last point that you made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2505)|
| 0:41:46| that because it's a national franchise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| they have their own design standards, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2508)|
| 0:41:52| I'm familiar with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2512)|
| 0:41:53| It often also means that while they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2513)|
| 0:41:58| kind of their first package,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2518)|
| 0:42:00| this is what we like to have everywhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2520)|
| 0:42:01| they will also yield to a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| when the community pushes back and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| we would like to have something that fits in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2525)|
| 0:42:08| a little bit better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| They'll frequently modify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2530)|
| 0:42:11| I don't know if this is one of those circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| but I just wanted to raise that as a point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2533)|
| 0:42:16| really for everyone listening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2536)|
| 0:42:17| that we don't have to accept the very first thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2537)|
| 0:42:19| that a national franchise offers, that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2539)|
| 0:42:22| No, and again, we have special use applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2542)|
| 0:42:25| to talk about those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| Yeah, I wanna say the zoning document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2547)|
| 0:42:31| is still almost still wet from being produced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2551)|
| 0:42:35| And here we are at this early stage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2555)|
| 0:42:39| looking at a significant alteration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2559)|
| 0:42:43| from that under the current zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2563)|
| 0:42:47| I mean, the area is all shown as CG3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2567)|
| 0:42:51| And where are we gonna stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| if we start changing it to CG1 now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2573)|
| 0:42:57| If there is an issue with the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| then we need to look at it more comprehensively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2579)|
| 0:43:02| not on an individual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2582)|
| 0:43:04| That's my personal opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2584)|
| 0:43:07| Chair will recognize Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2587)|
| 0:43:11| Thank you, Chairman Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2591)|
| 0:43:14| You know, we discussed Tuesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2594)|
| 0:43:15| and I enjoyed Commissioner Hill's mind debate as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2595)|
| 0:43:20| I think he always has a lot to bring to the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2600)|
| 0:43:23| but like I said the other day, I hear what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2603)|
| 0:43:28| And I think we do have to support this new zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2608)|
| 0:43:31| but I also think that with the way it was done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2611)|
| 0:43:35| maybe people were notified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2615)|
| 0:43:38| and no one was given the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2618)|
| 0:43:40| to opt out of it, if I recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| So in this case, this particular case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2622)|
| 0:43:45| I think the equivalent zone to what it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2625)|
| 0:43:49| being in C3 in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| the closest thing to that is CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2631)|
| 0:43:56| And I've got a question about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2636)|
| 0:43:58| If the special use permit, if this is rezoned CG3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2638)|
| 0:44:06| if this is not approved today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2646)|
| 0:44:10| can they still come through with the special use permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| and use their property the way they want to use it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2652)|
| 0:44:18| No, we wouldn't be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2658)|
| 0:44:20| Hang on, Mr. Mullins, let me ask Ms. Brooks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2660)|
| 0:44:23| or Ms. Porce to, for there are some comments from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2663)|
| 0:44:29| So Amy Brooks, Knox County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2669)|
| 0:44:33| No, they would need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| it is contingent on them getting their rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2675)|
| 0:44:38| They would have to modify their design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2678)|
| 0:44:42| I haven't actually looked at the special use application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2682)|
| 0:44:44| that they've submitted specifically, but it is a risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2684)|
| 0:44:47| And we make that clear to applicants on the front end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2687)|
| 0:44:49| if they choose to run these applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2689)|
| 0:44:53| staggered in this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2693)|
| 0:44:57| Well, having said that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2697)|
| 0:44:58| I know there's other commissioners who want to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| but I would like to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2700)|
| 0:45:02| I'd like to make a motion we approve CG1 for this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2702)|
| 0:45:07| Second, Boyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2707)|
| 0:45:08| I'm sorry, we're still under discussion, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2708)|
| 0:45:11| I had a couple more points to make myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2711)|
| 0:45:14| Commissioner Corbett, do you have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| That doesn't stop me from making a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2716)|
| 0:45:18| Motions can be made at any time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2718)|
| 0:45:20| under the current provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| Second, but we won't vote until everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| has had an opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2725)|
| 0:45:26| So Chair will recognize Commissioner Scott-Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2726)|
| 0:45:32| Yeah, I just wanted to support the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2732)|
| 0:45:37| Before I was gonna say that I'm in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2737)|
| 0:45:40| of allowing this change to CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2740)|
| 0:45:45| The muffler shop that's over there now is not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2745)|
| 0:45:47| I don't wanna be negative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2747)|
| 0:45:48| but it's not the most attractive building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| I pass it every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2750)|
| 0:45:52| And I think that these people are gonna go in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2752)|
| 0:45:55| and spend some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2755)|
| 0:45:56| They're gonna renovate that building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2756)|
| 0:45:57| and really renovate that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2757)|
| 0:46:01| I don't think we're giving up a significant amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2761)|
| 0:46:05| of anything in making this change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2765)|
| 0:46:08| So I just wanted to support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2768)|
| 0:46:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2770)|
| 0:46:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2772)|
| 0:46:13| Chair recognizes Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2773)|
| 0:46:18| I'd like to echo some of what Commissioner Phillips said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2778)|
| 0:46:22| I think a lot of, and some of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2782)|
| 0:46:26| that Commissioner Hill said in Tuesday's review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2786)|
| 0:46:29| a lot of time and effort was put into developing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2789)|
| 0:46:31| this new code and it is fairly new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2791)|
| 0:46:34| We have decided that this stretch of Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2794)|
| 0:46:39| as a community decided that this should be CG3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2799)|
| 0:46:43| and a corner lot is the bookend for the whole block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2803)|
| 0:46:48| And if we start with this very first case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| of not upholding what the new zoning code has put in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2810)|
| 0:46:55| with the CG3, then where do we stop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2815)|
| 0:46:58| You know, a corner lot is so important to the aesthetics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| of the whole, to the character of the whole block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2821)|
| 0:47:04| So I think it's important that we uphold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2824)|
| 0:47:07| the staff's recommendation for the CG3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2827)|
| 0:47:10| and not start off with the very first case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2830)|
| 0:47:14| that we have is requesting us start out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2834)|
| 0:47:17| start off with moving away from the new zoning regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2837)|
| 0:47:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2842)|
| 0:47:23| Chair recognizes Commissioner Korbelick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2843)|
| 0:47:28| Yes, I wanted to piggyback on Commissioner Adams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2848)|
| 0:47:31| by pointing out that the CG2 and three zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2851)|
| 0:47:35| the CG3 zone also has a design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2855)|
| 0:47:39| regarding building material so that we get something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2859)|
| 0:47:43| that is more aesthetic and will start fitting in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2863)|
| 0:47:46| with a more pedestrian or even a sense of place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2866)|
| 0:47:50| as you drive down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2870)|
| 0:47:52| I wonder if the applicant isn't over developing the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2872)|
| 0:47:57| if they are unable to meet the design standards of the CG3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2877)|
| 0:48:03| I wonder if it's possible they're trying to get too much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2883)|
| 0:48:05| on that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2885)|
| 0:48:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2889)|
| 0:48:10| Chair recognizes Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2890)|
| 0:48:13| We often hear cases and we are encouraged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2893)|
| 0:48:16| to not become so attached to the item that is going into it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2896)|
| 0:48:22| that if we're looking at a rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2902)|
| 0:48:24| we're rezoning for ever and whatever would go in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2904)|
| 0:48:28| I think that the applicant in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2908)|
| 0:48:31| I love the concept ideas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2911)|
| 0:48:33| but that applicant may not be there afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2913)|
| 0:48:36| So I want to have us remember that we're supposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2916)|
| 0:48:39| to be considering the entire zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2919)|
| 0:48:41| and what is for the whole area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2921)|
| 0:48:43| not just what the applicant may be coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2923)|
| 0:48:45| with at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2925)|
| 0:48:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2927)|
| 0:48:48| Chair recognizes Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2928)|
| 0:48:51| Thank you, Chair Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| This question is to staff because I think it's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2933)|
| 0:48:57| if we have some zoning inconsistencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2937)|
| 0:49:02| it should be revealed and if not, it should be explained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2942)|
| 0:49:07| To staff, would someone respond and ask me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2947)|
| 0:49:11| why we zoned the area where the new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2951)|
| 0:49:18| it's the 5,000 block of Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2958)|
| 0:49:22| It touches Westwood to the west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2962)|
| 0:49:26| Sutherland to the north and Kingston Pike to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2966)|
| 0:49:31| Now, this is not just, I'm not picking out one parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2971)|
| 0:49:35| I want to look at the whole stretch down through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2975)|
| 0:49:39| Are you pulling up the map?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2979)|
| 0:49:43| I just want to understand why we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2983)|
| 0:49:45| I mean, one, we're still in the family of CG| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2985)|
| 0:49:48| and I don't think we should penalize the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| because we didn't put design standards in CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2990)|
| 0:49:54| I think we need to go back and put design standards in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2994)|
| 0:49:58| But let's look at the, here in the heart of Bearden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=2998)|
| 0:50:02| And I just, I can't come to terms with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3002)|
| 0:50:06| why we can't give this a CG1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| and we have all of this CG1 that abuts residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3008)|
| 0:50:18| Ms. Brooks, would you like to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3018)|
| 0:50:19| This is Amy, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3019)|
| 0:50:20| So let me try to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3020)|
| 0:50:24| I was here obviously during the update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3024)|
| 0:50:25| to the zoning ordinance but as you all know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3025)|
| 0:50:28| who were involved, that Director Green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3028)|
| 0:50:31| was very involved in the mapping process for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3031)|
| 0:50:35| So part of the rationale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3035)|
| 0:50:37| one of the things that staff looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3037)|
| 0:50:40| were the sector plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3040)|
| 0:50:42| and the long range plans for these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| And I will say that there was some negotiation that happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3044)|
| 0:50:47| and there were property owners that spoke directly to staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3047)|
| 0:50:50| and specifically to Director Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3050)|
| 0:50:52| So I know one of the commissioners mentioned that earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3052)|
| 0:50:54| So there was some back and forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3054)|
| 0:50:56| with specific property owners about the rezoning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3056)|
| 0:51:01| So the idea around the more intense CG2 and 3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3061)|
| 0:51:08| and CH2 and 3 were around nodes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3068)|
| 0:51:12| So you see the mall in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3072)|
| 0:51:16| over towards the theater there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3076)|
| 0:51:21| And that is considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3081)|
| 0:51:22| that whole area is considered part of a node.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3082)|
| 0:51:24| And so thinking about nodes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3084)|
| 0:51:25| and that's where you'll see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| Instead of trying to apply those higher intensity portions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3087)|
| 0:51:32| of the CG and CH all along the corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| that's probably not realistic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3094)|
| 0:51:36| to see it developed out that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3096)|
| 0:51:38| at least in the next 10, 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3098)|
| 0:51:39| So that's just a little bit of background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3099)|
| 0:51:41| in terms of the context of how those districts were applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3101)|
| 0:51:46| Does that help answer your question, Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3106)|
| 0:51:48| Director Brooks, could you please zoom back in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3108)|
| 0:51:52| on that area that I was referring to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3112)|
| 0:51:54| I think it's important for people to see this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3114)|
| 0:51:57| and understand, and it may raise more questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3117)|
| 0:51:59| for other commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3119)|
| 0:52:00| Let's look at that Bearden area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3120)|
| 0:52:04| where we have R1 on a two lane street right up against CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3124)|
| 0:52:11| And how do you fairly tell some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3131)|
| 0:52:14| I mean, I was the biggest advocate for CG3 two days ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3134)|
| 0:52:18| until I saw this and it changed my mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3138)|
| 0:52:22| because I couldn't consistently come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3142)|
| 0:52:24| with the right deliberation on it because of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3144)|
| 0:52:30| So would you please speak to look at Sutherland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3150)|
| 0:52:34| where Westwood, you see Sutherland, Westwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3154)|
| 0:52:39| You can even look at Mercedes Place there at Newcomb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3159)|
| 0:52:42| all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3162)|
| 0:52:46| And you see R1 right there, right up against CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3166)|
| 0:52:52| No, yes, I see what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3172)|
| 0:52:55| And I would consider Homburg a node for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3175)|
| 0:52:59| No separation there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3179)|
| 0:53:01| At least they have separation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| They've got a four lane divided highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3183)|
| 0:53:07| with the target on Ramirez Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3187)|
| 0:53:11| So that's all I wanna say about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3191)|
| 0:53:13| But I think people need to see all the information here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3193)|
| 0:53:18| to try to understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| Chair recognizes Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3201)|
| 0:53:27| Thanks, Pat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3207)|
| 0:53:30| Again, we're going back to Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3210)|
| 0:53:32| Commissioner Easton, with all due respect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3212)|
| 0:53:34| I said this on Tuesday as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3214)|
| 0:53:36| This is not the first case we've heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3216)|
| 0:53:40| that somebody has come in and wanted their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3220)|
| 0:53:42| put back, rezoned back to the equivalent zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3222)|
| 0:53:46| to what it was before we went into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3226)|
| 0:53:49| before this new zone recode was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3229)|
| 0:53:54| I know of at least one with my neighbors down here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3234)|
| 0:53:56| that had to go back through this rezoning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3236)|
| 0:53:59| And I think I remember at least two others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3239)|
| 0:54:02| that we voted on that were asking to have their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3242)|
| 0:54:06| put back to an equivalent zone, what it was before recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3246)|
| 0:54:11| And this, I see this as really similar to those cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3251)|
| 0:54:16| because in fact, we have changed their ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3256)|
| 0:54:22| to develop the property the way they want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3262)|
| 0:54:24| the way it was before recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3264)|
| 0:54:27| Recode changed their ability to develop their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3267)|
| 0:54:30| that they owned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3270)|
| 0:54:31| And I struggle with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3271)|
| 0:54:35| And that's why I made the motion that I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3275)|
| 0:54:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3278)|
| 0:54:39| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3279)|
| 0:54:40| I recognize Commissioner Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3280)|
| 0:54:43| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3283)|
| 0:54:44| So first of all, I just want to say thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3284)|
| 0:54:48| to the applicants and to the business owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3288)|
| 0:54:51| that are here and trying to get this rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3291)|
| 0:54:56| because we all love to see new businesses come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3296)|
| 0:54:59| But I'm sort of in the same camp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3299)|
| 0:55:05| I worry about the dimensional standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3305)|
| 0:55:10| and I also worry about it being on the corner lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3310)|
| 0:55:16| That has me worried| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3316)|
| 0:55:17| because I go by there a million times in a week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3317)|
| 0:55:20| and that just kind of bothers me a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3320)|
| 0:55:24| And I think that probably did factor in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3324)|
| 0:55:29| why the zoning, it was done that way in recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3329)|
| 0:55:34| But there again, I think we're setting a precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3334)|
| 0:55:37| I think also as Commissioner Adams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3337)|
| 0:55:41| I was going to bring this up before she did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3341)|
| 0:55:45| We're not supposed to be talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3345)|
| 0:55:47| what's going to go on that land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3347)|
| 0:55:49| It's going to get rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3349)|
| 0:55:51| and hopefully this will work out fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3351)|
| 0:55:54| for these business owners, whatever happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3354)|
| 0:55:57| But like, we know that that gets us into trouble sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3357)|
| 0:56:02| We should be looking at the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3362)|
| 0:56:04| not what's going to be the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3364)|
| 0:56:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3367)|
| 0:56:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3369)|
| 0:56:11| Chair recognizes Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3371)|
| 0:56:14| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3374)|
| 0:56:15| And I've listened to all the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3375)|
| 0:56:17| and I want to go back to just a couple of questions I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3377)|
| 0:56:20| and pardon me for having the new hat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3380)|
| 0:56:24| I guess, still on in the questions I'm about to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3384)|
| 0:56:28| The comments have been made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3388)|
| 0:56:30| this is kind of a precedent setting decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3390)|
| 0:56:35| that we're making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3395)|
| 0:56:36| The question I have is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3396)|
| 0:56:38| based on what Commissioner Hill brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3398)|
| 0:56:41| is it possible that our zoning itself is inconsistent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3401)|
| 0:56:45| which is causing the problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3405)|
| 0:56:47| based on what Commissioner Hill brought up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| of the CG1 being up against an RN1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3409)|
| 0:56:52| versus how the zoning is applied for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3412)|
| 0:56:56| So therefore, it's going to cause us problems in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3416)|
| 0:56:59| because there's not consistency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3419)|
| 0:57:01| across all of the zoning structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3421)|
| 0:57:04| So if that is the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3424)|
| 0:57:07| then I am more inclined to support the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3427)|
| 0:57:11| before us for rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3431)|
| 0:57:12| just because of the inconsistencies of how recode| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3432)|
| 0:57:16| basically was done and left us with this mess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3436)|
| 0:57:19| If there aren't inconsistencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3439)|
| 0:57:21| which right now I don't know how you could say there aren't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3441)|
| 0:57:24| then obviously we wouldn't need to change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3444)|
| 0:57:26| So I guess, rather than looking at this one issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3446)|
| 0:57:29| as the precedent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3449)|
| 0:57:30| is it that the zoning that we have in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3450)|
| 0:57:34| is going to be causing us these problems in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| because there's inconsistencies across the entire city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3456)|
| 0:57:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3462)|
| 0:57:44| Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3464)|
| 0:57:45| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3465)|
| 0:57:46| I'd like to speak to that question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3466)|
| 0:57:50| that Commissioner Hill raised a minute ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3470)|
| 0:57:53| And thank Nick on our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3473)|
| 0:57:54| So as I mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3474)|
| 0:57:56| there was a lot of discussion that went on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3476)|
| 0:57:58| regarding what I mentioned as negotiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3478)|
| 0:58:02| So we had different iterations of the zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3482)|
| 0:58:05| As you all know, we had hundreds of public meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3485)|
| 0:58:08| and we had several different iterations of the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3488)|
| 0:58:11| And so in this area along Kingston Pike, Homburg area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3491)|
| 0:58:15| it was originally in map two, CG2 and CG3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3495)|
| 0:58:19| And it was public comment that was received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3499)|
| 0:58:22| that guided the changes to CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3502)|
| 0:58:25| So again, there was a lot of conversation with the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3505)|
| 0:58:28| about specifically the map itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3508)|
| 0:58:31| and how these zones should be applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3511)|
| 0:58:32| And so there was some concern from residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3512)|
| 0:58:35| in and around this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| of having CG2 larger scale buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3517)|
| 0:58:41| CG3 in this area in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3521)|
| 0:58:44| and how that it might dwarf the way that that road feels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3524)|
| 0:58:49| in comparison to the area that we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3529)|
| 0:58:52| that's closer to the mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3532)|
| 0:58:55| Thank you, Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3535)|
| 0:58:58| Seeing no other hands up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3538)|
| 0:59:00| we have a motion by Commissioner Watts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3540)|

| 1:00:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3603)|
| 1:00:06| The motion fails six to seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3606)|
| 1:00:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3609)|

| 1:01:18| Now this might be a good opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3678)|
| 1:01:21| to look at the broader picture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3681)|
| 1:01:23| particularly along this section of Kempston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3683)|
| 1:01:26| and maybe that can be included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3686)|
| 1:01:27| in the next commission retreat when we have one next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3687)|
| 1:01:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3692)|
| 1:01:34| The next item is agenda item number 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3694)|
| 1:01:37| Applicant is Patricia Nelson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3697)|
| 1:01:40| Location is the south side of Oliver Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3700)|
| 1:01:43| due north of Strawberry Plains Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3703)|
| 1:01:46| Property is 4.15 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3706)|
| 1:01:49| Present plan and zoning designation is LDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3709)|
| 1:01:51| Low Density Residential Bay Agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3711)|
| 1:01:56| Opposed plan and designation zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| is GC General Commercial, CA General Business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3718)|
| 1:02:09| One second, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3729)|
| 1:02:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3731)|
| 1:02:12| Staff recommendation is to not deny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3732)|
| 1:02:15| GC General Commercial designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3735)|
| 1:02:18| because it is not consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3738)|
| 1:02:19| with the surrounding development or zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3739)|
| 1:02:22| And also to deny CA General Business zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3742)|
| 1:02:27| because it is not consistent or compatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3747)|
| 1:02:31| with the sector plan and can create adverse impacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3751)|
| 1:02:34| for the surrounding agricultural and low density areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3754)|

| 1:02:55| this item has been postponed twice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3775)|
| 1:02:57| because the applicant could not attend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3777)|

| 1:03:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3799)|
| 1:03:20| Your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3800)|
| 1:03:21| I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3801)|
| 1:03:23| You and Mr. Murphy want to split minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3803)|
| 1:03:25| I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3805)|
| 1:03:28| Hello?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3808)|
| 1:03:29| Yes, Mr. Arnold, can you hear us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3809)|
| 1:03:35| Yes, I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3815)|
| 1:03:37| You have, you and Mr. Murphy have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3817)|
| 1:03:41| You might want to split that with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3821)|
| 1:03:46| Your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3826)|
| 1:03:47| Does Mr. Murphy want to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3827)|
| 1:03:51| I'll go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3831)|
| 1:03:53| I'll be pretty brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3833)|
| 1:03:55| My name is Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3835)|
| 1:03:59| Primarily, I urge you to vote against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3839)|
| 1:04:03| Primary reason is the request requires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3843)|
| 1:04:06| a sector plan amendment to general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3846)|
| 1:04:08| This is a similar, there's another case coming up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3848)|
| 1:04:11| where there's also sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3851)|
| 1:04:13| to general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3853)|
| 1:04:14| And from the land use classification table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3854)|
| 1:04:17| that's in the East County sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3857)|
| 1:04:19| it clearly states that that land use classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3859)|
| 1:04:22| and related zoning should not be extended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3862)|
| 1:04:26| It's really only meant to capture places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3866)|
| 1:04:27| that were previously developed strip corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3867)|
| 1:04:30| So this is one that's a legacy that we want to try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3870)|
| 1:04:34| and remove and not do more of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3874)|
| 1:04:38| The sector plan is really pretty clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3878)|
| 1:04:39| This all is designated low density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3879)|
| 1:04:42| on the sector plan for that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3882)|
| 1:04:45| There is some underlying CA zoning next door to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3885)|
| 1:04:47| but it appears that that's a legacy CA strip| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3887)|
| 1:04:50| that was probably from zoning from decades ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3890)|
| 1:04:52| So I urge you to deny this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3892)|
| 1:04:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3895)|
| 1:04:57| Mr. Arnold, your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3897)|
| 1:05:02| Yes, my name is Clyde Arnold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3902)|
| 1:05:04| I live at 1601 Osborne Road, Knoxville, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3904)|
| 1:05:12| I appreciate your child's consideration of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3912)|
| 1:05:16| I wanted to just give you a little history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3916)|
| 1:05:18| I concur with Mr. Murphy and with the recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3918)|
| 1:05:22| of the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3922)|
| 1:05:24| and for the reasons that Dave stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3924)|
| 1:05:26| So I'll try to make this a little shorter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3926)|
| 1:05:29| this rezoning being denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3929)|
| 1:05:31| Osborne Road is a short road, approximately a mile long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3931)|
| 1:05:36| between Strawberry Plains Pike and Moschino Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3936)|
| 1:05:40| It's a, it has been a low density residential area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3940)|
| 1:05:44| since the 40s or 50s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3944)|
| 1:05:46| There's only about 33 houses on Osborne Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3946)|
| 1:05:51| and two short dead-end streets that run off of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3951)|
| 1:05:56| The only, there is no other commercial business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3956)|
| 1:05:58| I saw that zoning on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3958)|
| 1:06:01| Those are, those two lots are, that lot is houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3961)|
| 1:06:04| There's never been a business there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3964)|
| 1:06:06| I've lived here 27 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3966)|
| 1:06:08| My wife has actually owned this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3968)|
| 1:06:11| and lived in my house, which is two doors down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3971)|
| 1:06:14| from this property since 1964.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3974)|
| 1:06:16| So she's been here almost 57 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3976)|
| 1:06:20| There's never been any commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3980)|
| 1:06:22| There was a use of a warehouse building on 1630,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3982)|
| 1:06:27| which is the property in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3987)|
| 1:06:30| This property was bought by Mr. Lee in 1946.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3990)|
| 1:06:34| In 1960, he also owned eight or 10 other houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3994)|
| 1:06:39| that immediately surround this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=3999)|
| 1:06:42| And in 1960, he built a warehouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4002)|
| 1:06:46| He was a partner in Jones and Lee Collectible Supply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4006)|
| 1:06:49| in downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4009)|
| 1:06:50| The only thing they've ever used that building for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4010)|
| 1:06:54| and it ceased being used in 2008 approximately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4014)|
| 1:06:57| was for a warehouse for them to bring their supplies in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4017)|
| 1:07:01| a tractor-trailer truck, and then they would take them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4021)|
| 1:07:04| I guess, when they needed them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4024)|
| 1:07:05| to their retail location in downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4025)|
| 1:07:11| But there's not been ever any other commercial business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4031)|
| 1:07:15| since I've lived here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4035)|
| 1:07:17| Mr. Lee died in 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4037)|
| 1:07:20| Jones and Lee were sold to another company in 2000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4040)|
| 1:07:25| in Mayer Electric in 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4045)|
| 1:07:29| Ms. Lee died in 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4049)|
| 1:07:32| and the applicant today is their daughter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4052)|
| 1:07:35| and she acquired the property by deed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4055)|
| 1:07:37| after they settled the estate in 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4057)|
| 1:07:41| But there's no reason for commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4061)|
| 1:07:43| This is just right in the heart of Osborne Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4063)|
| 1:07:48| I will say this, that there's never been an attempt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4068)|
| 1:07:51| to have this property re-zoned or used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4071)|
| 1:07:54| for use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4074)|
| 1:07:57| either during or after the use for the warehouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4077)|
| 1:08:01| And it would have not been allowed under those codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4081)|
| 1:08:04| and shouldn't be allowed now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4084)|
| 1:08:12| This property, I wanna give you just some short,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4092)|
| 1:08:14| brief history of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4094)|
| 1:08:15| There's been over 10 violations for zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4095)|
| 1:08:18| dirty lot, improper use of this property since 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4098)|
| 1:08:24| They've tried to use it for a tire disposal lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4104)|
| 1:08:28| They tried to use it for an air stock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4108)|
| 1:08:30| which ironically could have been used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4110)|
| 1:08:32| if they had just followed the rules and regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4112)|
| 1:08:35| and asked for use on review, but they didn't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4115)|
| 1:08:38| They have never made any attempt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4118)|
| 1:08:40| to follow the rules and regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4120)|
| 1:08:42| like everyone would else have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4122)|
| 1:08:45| And so, the president is actually a guy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4125)|
| 1:08:50| that has a license on there for auto repair shop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4130)|
| 1:08:54| and a lot of the business license people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4134)|
| 1:08:56| that issued it on a property that was not properly zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4136)|
| 1:09:01| I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4141)|
| 1:09:03| They said that was no concern to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4143)|
| 1:09:05| but that was just for the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4145)|
| 1:09:06| so they can collect sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4146)|
| 1:09:08| I don't know if states collect any sales tax or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4148)|
| 1:09:10| because you can't look at the records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4150)|
| 1:09:12| But it's used as an auto repair shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4152)|
| 1:09:17| First notice issued in the spring of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4157)|
| 1:09:20| Excuse me, Mr. Arnold, you need to conclude your remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4160)|
| 1:09:23| Okay, I've got to wrap up real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4163)|
| 1:09:27| Anyway, Mr. Pickle also has a glasses for towing recovery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4167)|
| 1:09:34| lot on the Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4174)|
| 1:09:36| And obviously, he has consolidated those two businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4176)|
| 1:09:40| to this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4180)|
| 1:09:41| Nobody wants a junkyard right in the middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4181)|
| 1:09:43| of a residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4183)|
| 1:09:45| So I would urge you not to approve this rezoning request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4185)|
| 1:09:50| that would be in compliance with the staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4190)|
| 1:09:53| of the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4193)|
| 1:09:55| Thank you, Mr. Arnold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4195)|
| 1:09:56| I'm happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4196)|
| 1:09:58| Chair recognizes Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4198)|
| 1:10:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4202)|
| 1:10:03| I wanted to make a motion that we vote to deny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4203)|
| 1:10:06| GC in support of staff's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4206)|
| 1:10:08| based upon the fact that the designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4208)|
| 1:10:11| is not consistent with the surrounding development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4211)|
| 1:10:14| or zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4214)|
| 1:10:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4216)|
| 1:10:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4218)|
| 1:10:20| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4220)|
| 1:10:24| Yeah, a couple of months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4224)|
| 1:10:25| I kind of think this was an item that came up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4225)|

| 1:17:03| and there's years and years of serious flooding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4623)|
| 1:17:08| well-documented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4628)|
| 1:17:12| In March of 2018, Commissioner Scott Smith said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4632)|
| 1:17:15| the area is suitable, if any of it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4635)|
| 1:17:18| to do something 2,000 feet from Beverly Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4638)|
| 1:17:21| means you've got to build a road at a 30% slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4641)|
| 1:17:24| adjoining a floodway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4644)|
| 1:17:26| 2,000 feet back to the area you're gonna develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4646)|
| 1:17:29| I think it's a big opportunity to make a big mess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4649)|
| 1:17:34| When staff was asked why in 2018,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4654)|
| 1:17:38| the NPC staff recommended one unit per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4658)|
| 1:17:42| Mike Rousseau said, when you talk about rough properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4662)|
| 1:17:46| this is as rough a one as I've seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4666)|
| 1:17:49| We don't have information to justify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4669)|
| 1:17:51| any more than one per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4671)|
| 1:17:56| And even, and this was also up in 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4676)|
| 1:18:00| and the staff report said some degree of flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4680)|
| 1:18:03| occurs somewhat regularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4683)|
| 1:18:05| Residents concerned about the condition of the bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4685)|
| 1:18:08| across White Creek, which does not have guardrails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4688)|
| 1:18:11| the width of the bridge is such| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4691)|
| 1:18:13| it cannot accommodate two directional traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4693)|
| 1:18:18| When a tractor trail is crossing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4698)|
| 1:18:20| cars approaching must wait for it to cross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4700)|
| 1:18:23| To the south, the road has a sharp curve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4703)|
| 1:18:25| around the high ridge with no shoulder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4705)|
| 1:18:27| creating a possible safety concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4707)|
| 1:18:29| with regard to the entry point of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4709)|
| 1:18:32| Staff is concerned about safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4712)|
| 1:18:34| with regard to the speed people actually travel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4714)|
| 1:18:37| coming around that curve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| and those slowing down to turn into this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4719)|
| 1:18:44| I want to say that due to flooding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4724)|
| 1:18:47| Beverly Road is often closed two to three times a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4727)|
| 1:18:51| at the proposed entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4731)|
| 1:18:53| The railroad has been clear that there will be no changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4733)|
| 1:18:56| to that narrow bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4736)|
| 1:18:58| Several times a year, they have to rebuild| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4738)|
| 1:19:00| the bed of the track due to washout from rain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4740)|
| 1:19:05| In addition, a hydrologist who examined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4745)|
| 1:19:10| this watershed area in a report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4750)|
| 1:19:14| talked about that any development in this watershed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4754)|
| 1:19:19| would result in increases in either runoff volume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4759)|
| 1:19:22| or peak flows and would have a negative impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4762)|
| 1:19:25| on downstream properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4765)|
| 1:19:27| These negative impacts would likely consist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4767)|
| 1:19:29| of an increased frequency of nuisance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4769)|
| 1:19:32| and or property damaging flooding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4772)|
| 1:19:35| channel erosion and sediment depositions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4775)|
| 1:19:38| Dr. Smoot, when he was talking about the Whites Creek Basin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4778)|
| 1:19:42| which this property is immediately along Whites Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4782)|
| 1:19:49| he said, even if stormwater management system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4789)|
| 1:19:51| is designed, constructed and maintained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4791)|
| 1:19:53| to meet requirements, many negative impacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4793)|
| 1:19:55| would still likely occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4795)|
| 1:19:58| Ms. Shea, could you wrap up your comments, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4798)|
| 1:20:02| Yes, so these groups and these neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4802)|
| 1:20:07| ask that the commission support the March 2018| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4807)|
| 1:20:12| professional staff recommendation to approve rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4812)|
| 1:20:16| at a density of one dwelling unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4816)|
| 1:20:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4819)|
| 1:20:19| Thank you, Ms. Shea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4819)|
| 1:20:21| Chair recognizes Mr. Randy Gennard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4821)|
| 1:20:25| Randy Gennard, 5408 Fountain Gate Road, Knoxville 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4825)|
| 1:20:33| You have five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4833)|
| 1:20:35| This is the third time this has come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4835)|
| 1:20:40| As it sits, the zoning, the present zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4840)|
| 1:20:43| would allow 120 units in the RB zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4843)|
| 1:20:48| as well as industrial units, just for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4848)|
| 1:20:53| But we're asking for a zoning that's consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4853)|
| 1:20:58| with what the staff has recommended now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4858)|
| 1:21:02| Just to speak of the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4862)|
| 1:21:03| the staff member that recommended the 2018 61 dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4863)|
| 1:21:10| was never on that piece of property until later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4870)|
| 1:21:14| And I had taken him and others and our consultants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4874)|
| 1:21:18| all over this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4878)|
| 1:21:20| And the cluster development that we're looking at now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4880)|
| 1:21:23| is consistent with the rezoning requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4883)|
| 1:21:28| The question came up earlier about why we had not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4888)|
| 1:21:35| deeded over the property to Legacy Parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4895)|
| 1:21:40| And should this not be rezoned for residential development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4900)|
| 1:21:45| that area would be needed for the industrial laydown yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4905)|
| 1:21:49| That's all I have right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4909)|
| 1:21:51| If there's any questions, I'd be glad to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4911)|
| 1:21:54| Thank you, Mr. Gennard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4914)|
| 1:21:56| I would ask Mr. Porce, who's the staff on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4916)|
| 1:22:01| to comment on the proposed density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4921)|
| 1:22:03| that staff is recommending of 2.51| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4923)|
| 1:22:07| compared to what was mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4927)|
| 1:22:09| in the March 2018 commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4929)|
| 1:22:14| Sure, so my recommendation is it's largely based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4934)|
| 1:22:19| on the Hillside and Ridgetop analysis of 2.47.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4939)|
| 1:22:23| Actually, Taryn, I'm gonna share my screen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4943)|
| 1:22:26| so it'll stop you for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4946)|
| 1:22:30| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4950)|
| 1:22:33| Okay, so let me get my screen out of the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4953)|
| 1:22:38| So here's the density analysis from 2018| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4958)|
| 1:22:43| and the slopes, all the information is exactly the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4963)|
| 1:22:46| 2.47, 2.47, 2.47.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4966)|
| 1:22:49| It's all distributed over the 61 1 1 1 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4969)|
| 1:22:53| And then that comes out with the 152 dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4973)|
| 1:22:56| And just to kind of reiterate a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4976)|
| 1:22:58| about what I talked about during the agenda review meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4978)|
| 1:23:00| is that the Hillside and Ridgetop analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4980)|
| 1:23:04| does not include the land in a floodplain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4984)|
| 1:23:07| in the calculation because you can't build in a floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4987)|
| 1:23:11| However, when we're assigning density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4991)|
| 1:23:13| we're talking about that as the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4993)|
| 1:23:15| it's distributed over the entire piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4995)|
| 1:23:17| We've never removed the Hillside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=4997)|
| 1:23:20| or sorry, the floodplain areas from the parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5000)|
| 1:23:24| when we're talking about density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5004)|
| 1:23:26| And to do that in this instance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5006)|
| 1:23:28| would essentially be penalizing someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5008)|
| 1:23:31| for having floodplains on their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5011)|
| 1:23:33| Now that said, they were given some recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5013)|
| 1:23:39| in 2018 and again in 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5019)|
| 1:23:41| and they've come back and done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5021)|
| 1:23:42| So it is clustered, they're using permeable pavers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5022)|
| 1:23:44| and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5024)|
| 1:23:47| And again, kind of getting at some of the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5027)|
| 1:23:49| that have been talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5029)|
| 1:23:50| the bridge, the flooding, the roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5030)|
| 1:23:52| those are all things that will be addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5032)|
| 1:23:55| during the use on review and concept phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5035)|
| 1:23:58| So the engineers would have to show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5038)|
| 1:24:00| that their stormwater retention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5040)|
| 1:24:02| was able to get the stormwater runoff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5042)|
| 1:24:04| to a level no worse than it is pre-development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5044)|
| 1:24:08| And if they can't make those calculations work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5048)|
| 1:24:10| they would have to relook at their plan again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5050)|
| 1:24:14| until they could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5054)|
| 1:24:15| And my take on that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5055)|
| 1:24:17| if they could make the calculations work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5057)|
| 1:24:18| they have to come back with less units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5058)|
| 1:24:21| smaller units or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5061)|
| 1:24:23| That's just the way the stormwater ordinance works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5063)|
| 1:24:25| and that's the charge of engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5065)|
| 1:24:27| Same thing with the roads, the flooding, the bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5067)|
| 1:24:29| all that stuff would be looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5069)|
| 1:24:30| as part of the traffic impact study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5070)|
| 1:24:34| So whether or not the bridge would be widened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5074)|
| 1:24:36| or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5076)|
| 1:24:38| Any of those kinds of traffic related conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5078)|
| 1:24:41| site distance, access points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5081)|
| 1:24:42| all that stuff gets looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5082)|
| 1:24:44| with concept and use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5084)|
| 1:24:47| I hope that answered your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5087)|
| 1:24:49| Let me know if there's anything else you need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5089)|
| 1:24:51| Thank you, Ms. Porchai.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5091)|
| 1:24:53| Chair will recognize Commissioner Korbelek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5093)|
| 1:24:57| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5097)|
| 1:24:58| I had a question for Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5098)|
| 1:25:02| I'm a little bit confused and I appreciate your patience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5102)|
| 1:25:07| If an application was coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5107)|
| 1:25:10| and had the floodway floodplain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5110)|
| 1:25:13| when you calculate density or the total acreage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5113)|
| 1:25:18| that it can be developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5118)|
| 1:25:19| do you include that or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5119)|
| 1:25:25| Commissioner Korbelek, as Michelle just pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5125)|
| 1:25:27| we do include it as part of our analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5127)|
| 1:25:34| Both the floodway and the floodplain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5134)|
| 1:25:39| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5139)|
| 1:25:40| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5140)|
| 1:25:42| Chair recognizes Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5142)|
| 1:25:45| Yes, this is a question for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5145)|
| 1:25:48| Could he speak to the Legacy Parks component again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5148)|
| 1:25:51| That was said very quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5151)|
| 1:25:53| and I could not understand the point that was being made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5153)|
| 1:25:59| Yeah, this is Randy Gnaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5159)|
| 1:26:00| The reason we haven't donated it to Legacy Parks until,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5160)|
| 1:26:07| we want to wait until the rezoning is done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5167)|
| 1:26:10| or the concept plan is finished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5170)|
| 1:26:13| because if we have to maintain the current zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5173)|
| 1:26:17| that floodplain would be used in an industrial application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5177)|
| 1:26:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5187)|
| 1:26:31| I would just like to say for the other commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5191)|
| 1:26:34| we've heard a lot from the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5194)|
| 1:26:37| on this particular case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5197)|
| 1:26:39| And I've been struck by the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5199)|
| 1:26:42| that the case has come up multiple times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5202)|
| 1:26:45| and the community members are pointing back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5205)|
| 1:26:49| to decisions that were made then in specific comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5209)|
| 1:26:53| and that they're not saying don't develop this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5213)|
| 1:26:56| that they're saying be sensitive to the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5216)|
| 1:26:59| I think that's an important thing to recognize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5219)|
| 1:27:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5222)|
| 1:27:05| Chair recognizes Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5225)|
| 1:27:08| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5228)|
| 1:27:11| I have a question about the 16 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5231)|
| 1:27:16| that is being or proposed to be donated to Legacy Parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5236)|
| 1:27:23| If you figure on the total 78 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5243)|
| 1:27:31| or opposed to the 61 acres, it comes out the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5251)|
| 1:27:37| The same number of units just depends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5257)|
| 1:27:40| on how large an area you're covering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5260)|
| 1:27:44| And if staff is recommending 2.51 on 78, I think it's 78,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5264)|
| 1:27:55| when he donates the property to Legacy Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5275)|
| 1:28:01| does that take away 16 acres of the 2.51,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5281)|
| 1:28:07| which would be what, 30 some units, 30 or 40 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5287)|
| 1:28:15| And if you leave the three point, whatever it is, two, two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5295)|
| 1:28:19| on the 78 and he donates it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5299)|
| 1:28:23| then he's gaining 60 more units or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5303)|
| 1:28:31| So how do you, 3.2 and 2.5 are the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5311)|
| 1:28:40| just depending on how many acres you're figuring it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5320)|
| 1:28:44| So how do you approve this and give him the units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5324)|
| 1:28:53| that we're talking about and have him donate the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5333)|
| 1:28:59| at the same time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5339)|
| 1:29:01| He comes up with less property to donate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5341)|
| 1:29:06| or less property to put the, he needs 3.22| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5346)|
| 1:29:12| to get the same number of units as he's got on 2.51| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5352)|
| 1:29:16| on the same thing, if you follow me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5356)|
| 1:29:21| Commissioner Graff, are you asking a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5361)|
| 1:29:23| of Ms. Porche or Ms. Brooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5363)|
| 1:29:26| Well, probably of staff, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5366)|
| 1:29:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5369)|
| 1:29:30| Ms. Porche, you wanna respond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5370)|
| 1:29:32| to Commissioner Graff's comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5372)|
| 1:29:34| Sure, and this comment was brought up last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5374)|
| 1:29:37| at December of 2019 as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5377)|
| 1:29:40| And that's why the motion was a little bit deferred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5380)|
| 1:29:44| from our normal standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5384)|
| 1:29:45| So usually we would recommend a density of such,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5385)|
| 1:29:49| however many units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5389)|
| 1:29:50| And last year when we did this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5390)|
| 1:29:53| the motion was made to approve a certain amount of units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5393)|
| 1:29:57| So you could either do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5397)|
| 1:29:59| you can make a motion to approve a certain amount of units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5399)|
| 1:30:01| or you can make a motion that said that you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5401)|
| 1:30:04| to specify the number of acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5404)|
| 1:30:05| So if he wanted to follow the recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5405)|
| 1:30:07| and do the 2.51 dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5407)|
| 1:30:13| you would say over the entire parcel 78 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5413)|
| 1:30:16| just to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5416)|
| 1:30:17| So I believe you could do it either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5417)|
| 1:30:19| Yeah, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5419)|
| 1:30:21| But then he donates 16 acres, so he doesn't have 78.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5421)|
| 1:30:27| Well, at that point, the zoning is already in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5427)|
| 1:30:30| And so he would get that density over the, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5430)|
| 1:30:35| over the 60%-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5435)|
| 1:30:36| He would get density then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5436)|
| 1:30:39| Right, yeah, so you'd have to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5439)|
| 1:30:41| by the number of units, that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5441)|
| 1:30:43| Okay, then I have another comment or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5443)|
| 1:30:47| Talking about the length of the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5447)|
| 1:30:49| and what a bad piece of property it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5449)|
| 1:30:52| whether you put 61 units or 150,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5452)|
| 1:30:58| it's all gonna go in the same place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5458)|
| 1:31:01| Is that, am I right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5461)|
| 1:31:03| You're still gonna build the same road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5463)|
| 1:31:07| And when you get to the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5467)|
| 1:31:10| you either have 61 houses or you have 150| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5470)|
| 1:31:14| or whatever that comes up to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5474)|
| 1:31:17| No, am I correct on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5477)|
| 1:31:24| Are you asking me or are you asking the developer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5484)|
| 1:31:27| I'm asking whoever wants to answer, you or the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5487)|
| 1:31:32| It's still gonna go on the developable area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5492)|
| 1:31:40| the best part of the tract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5500)|
| 1:31:44| It's not gonna go up on the steep hillside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5504)|
| 1:31:49| it's gonna go in one spot, am I correct on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5509)|
| 1:31:54| Our recommendations are to keep the grading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5514)|
| 1:31:58| in the development in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5518)|
| 1:32:00| the green part of the hillside and bridge top analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5520)|
| 1:32:04| We're not talking about putting one house on one acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5524)|
| 1:32:09| we're talking about putting a lot of houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5529)|
| 1:32:13| on several acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5533)|
| 1:32:14| Right, the internal road and any of the structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5534)|
| 1:32:17| would go in that green part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5537)|
| 1:32:18| And I'll let the developer speak to that further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5538)|
| 1:32:20| as to his plans, if he wants to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5540)|
| 1:32:22| Okay, if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5542)|
| 1:32:25| That's right, this is Randy Gennard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5545)|
| 1:32:27| We looked at that and Scott Smith spoke about it earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5547)|
| 1:32:31| in the 2018, he is right in one way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5551)|
| 1:32:34| that long road going back in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5554)|
| 1:32:37| the only way to pay for the infrastructure is by density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5557)|
| 1:32:41| And so that is true that what they've asked us to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5561)|
| 1:32:46| and we've done is stay out of the hillside protection area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5566)|
| 1:32:49| which all our houses would be in the 15% or less slopes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5569)|
| 1:32:53| all our dwelling units and cluster development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5573)|
| 1:32:58| so we don't get into those slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5578)|
| 1:33:01| And last time we did ask for a maximum density of 210| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5581)|
| 1:33:07| and the staff recommended we cut some of that back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5587)|
| 1:33:09| because of the entrance road, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5589)|
| 1:33:12| And so this time it's 196 to allow for a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5592)|
| 1:33:16| of detention basins and taking some of the dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5596)|
| 1:33:20| out of the original entry road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5600)|
| 1:33:24| but it does take dwelling units to pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5604)|
| 1:33:27| for that infrastructure, you would understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5607)|
| 1:33:31| Okay, I just had the comments that I was concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5611)|
| 1:33:35| about the difference in the acreage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5615)|
| 1:33:38| and how that would be handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5618)|
| 1:33:42| I see there's others wanna speak to this, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5622)|
| 1:33:46| I'm done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5626)|
| 1:33:47| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5627)|
| 1:33:48| Chair recognizes Commissioner Corbett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5628)|
| 1:33:54| Yes, I had a question for the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5634)|
| 1:33:57| which is why has this been withdrawn so many times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5637)|
| 1:34:02| when it got to the commission level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5642)|
| 1:34:06| I can answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5646)|
| 1:34:08| On the first time it was gonna be allowed 100 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5648)|
| 1:34:12| which will not pay for the return on investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5652)|
| 1:34:16| for the roadway going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5656)|
| 1:34:18| At that time, I only had an option on the piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5658)|
| 1:34:21| I did not own it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5661)|
| 1:34:23| So it would have been a disservice to the owner at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5663)|
| 1:34:26| because the I and RB zonings that are currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5666)|
| 1:34:30| on this piece of property are desirable zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5670)|
| 1:34:35| There is a return on investment to be made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5675)|
| 1:34:39| on the I and the RB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5679)|
| 1:34:41| And also the last time it would have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5681)|
| 1:34:44| a very similar result that if we can't get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5684)|
| 1:34:49| the return on investment, I would rather retain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5689)|
| 1:34:54| the I and the RB zoning for investment purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5694)|
| 1:35:02| And a second question to the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5702)|
| 1:35:04| would you be maintaining the floodplain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5704)|
| 1:35:10| so that there is no stormwater detention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5710)|
| 1:35:12| or buildings within that area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5712)|
| 1:35:15| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5715)|
| 1:35:16| Everything we're doing currently that it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5716)|
| 1:35:19| in the concept plan have come up in the concept plan stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5719)|
| 1:35:22| We have drawn our own concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5722)|
| 1:35:25| There's nothing in the floodway or floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5725)|
| 1:35:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5730)|
| 1:35:32| Chair recognizes Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5732)|
| 1:35:36| I think we've always had a lot of comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5736)|
| 1:35:39| from the community and I really appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5739)|
| 1:35:42| the concerns about flooding within with additional building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5742)|
| 1:35:47| on a particular piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5747)|
| 1:35:49| I think planned residential is gonna be a much better option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5749)|
| 1:35:53| for us than industrial or the general residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5753)|
| 1:35:57| from a flooding perspective in order to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5757)|
| 1:36:02| to see that concept plan and see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5762)|
| 1:36:04| and I appreciate that they're saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5764)|
| 1:36:06| out of both the floodway and the floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5766)|
| 1:36:09| So I think that those are some good points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5769)|
| 1:36:11| But I do have a question for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5771)|
| 1:36:14| And so for staff, the hillside calculations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5774)|
| 1:36:18| came up to 2.47 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5778)|
| 1:36:22| I don't understand how you got your recommendation to 2.51.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5782)|
| 1:36:26| 2.51.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5786)|
| 1:36:28| It was just, to me, it was a number that was so close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5788)|
| 1:36:32| So I just felt like the right thing to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5792)|
| 1:36:35| was just to stick with the 196 units based on the decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5795)|
| 1:36:42| that was made last year and what I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5802)|
| 1:36:45| of the development plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5805)|
| 1:36:48| Okay, so that's backing up from 196 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5808)|
| 1:36:51| to get the dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5811)|
| 1:36:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5814)|
| 1:36:55| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5815)|
| 1:36:56| 0.04 dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5816)|
| 1:37:01| which to me was really close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5821)|
| 1:37:05| Chair recognizes Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5825)|
| 1:37:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5832)|
| 1:37:14| Yeah, I remember this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5834)|
| 1:37:15| I initially was very, very negative on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5835)|
| 1:37:17| I went and I think after we had voted the first time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5837)|
| 1:37:22| Mr. Gennard called me and I went out to the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5842)|
| 1:37:25| and kind of walked it and looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5845)|
| 1:37:28| And I still am not really enthusiastic about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5848)|
| 1:37:30| I think it's a tough site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5850)|
| 1:37:31| but I do think that there is middle ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5851)|
| 1:37:35| between the RB and the industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5855)|
| 1:37:37| that's currently zoned there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5857)|
| 1:37:40| And what, you know, not overdeveloping it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5860)|
| 1:37:44| or not trying to put too much on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5864)|
| 1:37:45| I think there is a number that makes sense to put on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5865)|
| 1:37:48| But I was kind of like Sandra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5868)|
| 1:37:51| I was wanting to ask like in 2019 and Randy Gennard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5871)|
| 1:37:55| I'm not sure if you answered this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5875)|
| 1:37:56| I know you said the first time you pulled it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5876)|
| 1:37:59| before County Commission, but in 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5879)|
| 1:38:04| you had 210 units, I think approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5884)|
| 1:38:06| Why did you withdraw again because you didn't own it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5886)|
| 1:38:10| or what was the reason there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5890)|
| 1:38:15| Scott, it's kind of hard to answer that question exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5895)|
| 1:38:19| We did own it at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5899)|
| 1:38:21| but not all the County Commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5901)|
| 1:38:23| there was some sickness and not all of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5903)|
| 1:38:25| were at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5905)|
| 1:38:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5906)|
| 1:38:29| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5909)|
| 1:38:31| I mean, my opinion is I kind of, I don't wanna,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5911)|
| 1:38:34| I hate to say this, but I think staff's kind of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5914)|
| 1:38:38| they kind of have it right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5918)|
| 1:38:39| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5919)|
| 1:38:43| I'm kind of agreeing with what their recommendation is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5923)|
| 1:38:45| for right now, but I'm glad to listen to everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5925)|
| 1:38:49| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5929)|
| 1:38:51| Is that all, Scott?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5931)|
| 1:38:54| No other hands are up, so we will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5934)|
| 1:38:57| Chair will entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5937)|
| 1:39:02| I'd like to make a motion to approve PR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5942)|
| 1:39:04| for per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5944)|
| 1:39:08| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5948)|
| 1:39:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5950)|
| 1:39:12| Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5952)|
| 1:39:13| Motion by Commissioner Ross,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5953)|
| 1:39:14| seconded by Commissioner Graft to approve PR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5954)|

| 1:39:29| Commissioner Eaton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5969)|
| 1:39:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5973)|
| 1:39:35| Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5975)|
| 1:39:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5977)|
| 1:39:39| Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5979)|
| 1:39:42| I want to say that I am concerned about flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5982)|
| 1:39:44| on this one, but to this plan residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5984)|
| 1:39:47| I'm going to vote yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5987)|
| 1:39:49| Commissioner Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5989)|
| 1:39:52| I'm going to vote yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5992)|
| 1:39:54| mainly because I would rather see plan residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5994)|
| 1:39:57| than industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=5997)|
| 1:40:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6000)|
| 1:40:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6002)|
| 1:40:03| Commissioner Dent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6003)|
| 1:40:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6005)|
| 1:40:07| Commissioner Ross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6007)|
| 1:40:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6008)|
| 1:40:10| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6010)|
| 1:40:11| I'd just like to echo because it's planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6011)|
| 1:40:15| I feel like that's the way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6015)|
| 1:40:18| We'll get to see it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6018)|
| 1:40:19| So yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6019)|
| 1:40:22| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6022)|
| 1:40:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6023)|

| 1:40:28| Commissioner Corbillette.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6028)|
| 1:40:31| It's my understanding that with the planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6031)|
| 1:40:35| the issues regarding traffic, the bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6035)|
| 1:40:39| and stormwater detention will be presented at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6039)|
| 1:40:42| So I vote yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6042)|
| 1:40:44| Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6044)|
| 1:40:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6046)|
| 1:40:48| Commissioner Boyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6048)|
| 1:40:51| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6051)|
| 1:40:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6052)|
| 1:40:53| Motion carries unanimously, 13 to zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6053)|
| 1:40:57| Thank you, Ms. Edmonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6057)|
| 1:40:59| Is there any objection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6059)|
| 1:40:59| Let's take a five minute recess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6059)|
| 1:41:01| and we'll be back at about 3.16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6061)|
| 1:41:06| Is everybody okay with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6066)|
| 1:41:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6068)|
| 1:41:12| All right, commissioners, if everybody can get back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6072)|
| 1:41:15| and we'll start item number 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6075)|
| 1:41:22| Hey, Pat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6082)|
| 1:41:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6084)|
| 1:41:25| Before we go on, so based on the last discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6085)|
| 1:41:29| I pulled up the County Commission meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6089)|
| 1:41:32| and I don't know if Mr. Garrard misspoke,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6092)|
| 1:41:36| but he said that he withdrew it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6096)|
| 1:41:38| because of absences on the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6098)|
| 1:41:41| yet the minutes indicate that all commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6101)|
| 1:41:43| were present at that meeting when it was withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6103)|
| 1:41:46| So I'd like to get, I don't know what our process is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6106)|
| 1:41:51| about the testimony he gave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6111)|
| 1:41:52| but the County Commission meetings do reflect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6112)|
| 1:41:56| that all commissioners were present during that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6116)|
| 1:41:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6119)|
| 1:42:01| You know, would that change a commissioner's vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6121)|
| 1:42:05| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6125)|
| 1:42:08| You know, he may have gotten confused with another meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6128)|
| 1:42:11| Well, it was just a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6131)|
| 1:42:13| that Scott Smith asked him directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6133)|
| 1:42:15| and he answered it one way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6135)|
| 1:42:18| So that's why I'm just, you know, more than anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6138)|
| 1:42:21| I wanna make sure that people, when they testify before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6141)|
| 1:42:24| are giving us factual information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6144)|
| 1:42:26| and not just telling us what they want us to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6146)|
| 1:42:29| to try and get past us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6149)|
| 1:42:32| Yeah, I don't know if he was trying to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6152)|
| 1:42:34| that he didn't feel like he had good support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6154)|
| 1:42:36| in that upcoming vote and that's why he pulled it or what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6156)|
| 1:42:40| So, but it probably would not change how I voted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6160)|
| 1:42:45| but I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6165)|
| 1:42:47| Scott, that's how I took his comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6167)|
| 1:42:49| but it would not change my vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6169)|
| 1:42:52| All right, let's proceed on with item number 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6172)|
| 1:42:56| This is a, will require two motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6176)|
| 1:43:00| The applicant is Barry Bolton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6180)|

| 1:43:34| for a portion of both properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6214)|
| 1:43:38| Staff recommendation on the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6218)|
| 1:43:41| is approved mixed use special district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6221)|

| 1:43:53| Applicant had requested GC general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6233)|

| 1:44:01| for the entirety of both properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6241)|
| 1:44:03| because it would allow commercial development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6243)|
| 1:44:07| and site plan review at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6247)|

| 1:44:13| on both parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6253)|
| 1:44:15| Is Mr. Bolton available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6255)|

| 1:44:33| One east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6273)|

| 1:45:02| Would you like to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6302)|
| 1:45:04| Would you like any opposition to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6304)|
| 1:45:06| Any opposition, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6306)|
| 1:45:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6307)|
| 1:45:09| Chair will recognize Mr. Kevin Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6309)|
| 1:45:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6313)|
| 1:45:14| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6314)|
| 1:45:17| I'm speaking in support of the staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6317)|
| 1:45:21| which is different than what the applicant's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6321)|
| 1:45:24| initial application was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6324)|
| 1:45:26| I'm also speaking in support of maintaining the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6326)|
| 1:45:30| and making a decision that adheres to the general plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6330)|
| 1:45:34| and the sector plan in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6334)|
| 1:45:37| This one, again, this is another application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6337)|
| 1:45:40| where general commercial sector plan amendment is requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6340)|
| 1:45:43| and that in the east county sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6343)|
| 1:45:45| is specifically called out as something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6345)|
| 1:45:46| that we don't want to extend that designation for anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6346)|
| 1:45:51| along with the underlying zonings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6351)|
| 1:45:53| particularly the CA zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6353)|
| 1:45:54| which is an old legacy zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6354)|
| 1:45:58| which is really permissive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6358)|
| 1:46:01| doesn't have much in the way of landscaping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6361)|
| 1:46:04| lighting, signage, all the standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6364)|
| 1:46:06| that we have tried to put in more modern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6366)|
| 1:46:09| So I'm certainly appreciate staff doing some thinking here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6369)|
| 1:46:14| and proposing the EC06 for the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6374)|
| 1:46:19| and then plan commercial underneath it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6379)|
| 1:46:21| which would be a nice design opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6381)|
| 1:46:23| to review the development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6383)|
| 1:46:25| So just want to speak in support of staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6385)|
| 1:46:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6388)|
| 1:46:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6389)|
| 1:46:31| Mr. Ball?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6391)|
| 1:46:34| Barry Balton, 7808 Asheville Highway, Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6394)|
| 1:46:38| 37924.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6398)|
| 1:46:40| We have requested that all of this be zone CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6400)|
| 1:46:45| As you can see, the property is split in half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6405)|
| 1:46:48| Half of it, I think is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6408)|
| 1:46:50| I think I'm saying on here, LDR or agriculture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6410)|
| 1:46:53| and the other half is CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6413)|
| 1:46:55| My plans were at some time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6415)|
| 1:46:58| to maybe build some sort of warehouse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6418)|
| 1:47:00| high top of warehouse that's been needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6420)|
| 1:47:03| I have several customers asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6423)|
| 1:47:06| for this type of building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6426)|
| 1:47:11| So I just didn't want to do anything wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6431)|
| 1:47:13| So I'm asking for CA upfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6433)|
| 1:47:16| I've not got any plans yet to build anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6436)|
| 1:47:18| but I'm asking for the zoning before I do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6438)|
| 1:47:24| Any other comments you'd like to make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6444)|
| 1:47:26| I would like to add, if you can see on this map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6446)|
| 1:47:29| there's CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6449)|
| 1:47:37| We lost your sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6457)|
| 1:47:38| Mr. Ball, your audio is not working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6458)|
| 1:47:40| Can you hear me, Mr. Ball?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6460)|
| 1:47:53| Mr. Reddy, would you like to respond, Barry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6473)|
| 1:47:57| I am Juanita Reddy with Southwest Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6477)|
| 1:48:02| Just to confirm what Mr. Barry Fulton asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6482)|
| 1:48:07| we'd really like to have a CA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6487)|
| 1:48:08| so we have some kind of a good planning for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6488)|
| 1:48:12| Like I said, we really don't know what we're going to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6492)|
| 1:48:17| Half of the property already is on CA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6497)|
| 1:48:20| so we're asking just to extend it to the end of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6500)|
| 1:48:28| All right, any other comments you'd like to make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6508)|
| 1:48:32| Hearing none, commissioners, any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6512)|

| 1:48:46| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6526)|
| 1:48:48| I'm familiar with this section of the Asheville Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6528)|
| 1:48:52| and I strongly support the planning department's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6532)|
| 1:48:56| planning staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6536)|
| 1:48:58| And when it's appropriate, I'd like to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6538)|
| 1:49:02| Recognize Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6542)|
| 1:49:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6544)|
| 1:49:08| Yeah, it looks like a little less than half of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6548)|
| 1:49:12| is already zoned CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6552)|
| 1:49:17| You know, I guess the applicant knows the PC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6557)|
| 1:49:21| he's not going to give up a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6561)|
| 1:49:23| He just has to submit a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6563)|
| 1:49:27| to where we can see what the parking is correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6567)|
| 1:49:30| maybe landscaping and buffering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6570)|
| 1:49:32| Do you understand that, Mr. Balton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6572)|
| 1:49:35| Or Juanis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6575)|
| 1:49:36| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6576)|
| 1:49:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6578)|
| 1:49:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6581)|
| 1:49:43| So Commissioner Corbett, if you'd like to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6583)|
| 1:49:48| Yes, I would like to make a motion to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6588)|
| 1:49:51| actually I'm a little confused on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6591)|
| 1:49:53| Do we have to actually deny what the applicant's requesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6593)|
| 1:49:55| or just go ahead and motion to approve the staff position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6595)|
| 1:49:59| For the sector plan, you can make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6599)|
| 1:50:01| to approve first staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6601)|
| 1:50:04| All right, for the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6604)|
| 1:50:08| I make a motion to approve the staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6608)|
| 1:50:12| for MUST and ECO-6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6612)|
| 1:50:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6617)|
| 1:50:21| Can I interrupt this before you finish?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6621)|
| 1:50:26| Real quick, Mr. Remy, that's typically not permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6626)|
| 1:50:29| since we've already turned it over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6629)|
| 1:50:31| to commission for discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6631)|
| 1:50:33| but we'll give you a little bit of latitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6633)|
| 1:50:36| We could keep the existing CA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6636)|
| 1:50:38| the part and the other part zone PC will be fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6638)|
| 1:50:43| if that's acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6643)|
| 1:50:48| All right, you've heard his comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6648)|
| 1:50:50| We've got a motion on the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6650)|
| 1:50:52| and a second to approve the sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6652)|
| 1:50:55| for staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6655)|
| 1:50:58| Ms. Edmonds, would you call the roll, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6658)|
| 1:51:01| Commissioner Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6661)|
| 1:51:05| I guess because the applicant's last request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6665)|
| 1:51:08| I'll vote no, because I think that's probably reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6668)|
| 1:51:12| to ask for the PC and the ag part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6672)|
| 1:51:15| so we can look at buffers and such| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6675)|
| 1:51:16| and just not complicate his life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6676)|
| 1:51:19| on the part that they have plans for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6679)|
| 1:51:22| So that's the only reason I'd vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6682)|
| 1:51:26| Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=6686)|

| 1:58:19| Hello, this is Grayson Schlipperville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7099)|
| 1:58:20| I'm legal counsel for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7100)|
| 1:58:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7103)|
| 1:58:25| My address is 8858 Cedar Springs Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7105)|

| 1:58:32| I see no others have signed up in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7112)|
| 1:58:35| So you have up to five minutes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7115)|
| 1:58:38| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7118)|
| 1:58:39| As reflected on this application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7119)|
| 1:58:41| my client DFS is seeking to have a small parcel of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7121)|
| 1:58:45| rezoned to permit use for a driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7125)|
| 1:58:49| DFS purchased this half acre parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7129)|
| 1:58:53| to connect to its existing parcel shaded in purple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7133)|
| 1:58:57| as the industrial mixed use area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7137)|
| 1:59:01| And these two parcels will ultimately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7141)|
| 1:59:02| be replanted together as a single parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7142)|
| 1:59:05| And the changes DFS proposes in conjunction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7145)|
| 1:59:08| with staff's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7148)|
| 1:59:11| would be an extension of the classifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7151)|
| 1:59:13| from the existing parcel to the new parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7153)|
| 1:59:16| The existing parcel currently has office buildings on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7156)|
| 1:59:19| and DFS proposes to build another office building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7159)|
| 1:59:23| with some smaller offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7163)|
| 1:59:25| These would be things like electricians, florists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7165)|
| 1:59:27| you know, there would not be a large amount of foot traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7167)|
| 1:59:31| or vehicle traffic in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7171)|
| 1:59:33| and no new buildings would be built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7173)|
| 1:59:35| on the subject parcel itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7175)|
| 1:59:39| To service the buildings on the existing parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7179)|
| 1:59:41| DFS would like to have the subject parcel rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7181)|
| 1:59:44| as reflected in our application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7184)|
| 1:59:46| such that we can use it as a driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7186)|
| 1:59:49| The driveway would be well landscaped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7189)|
| 1:59:50| well lit and maintained and would be a buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7190)|
| 1:59:54| between the existing buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7194)|
| 1:59:57| and other parts of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7197)|
| 2:00:00| The subject parcel currently has a single family residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7200)|
| 2:00:02| which is in disrepair, it's seen better days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7202)|
| 2:00:07| The adjacent woods were used by squatters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7207)|
| 2:00:09| the area was littered with trash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7209)|
| 2:00:11| and generally poorly treated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7211)|
| 2:00:14| This represents a health and safety concern for the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7214)|
| 2:00:18| In addition, the single family residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7218)|
| 2:00:20| was surrounded by other kind of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7220)|
| 2:00:23| incongruous uses, there's an apartment here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7223)|
| 2:00:25| a church there, my client's offices nearby,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7225)|
| 2:00:29| you know, a vacant lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7229)|
| 2:00:31| I mean, it was an island in the middle of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7231)|
| 2:00:34| you know, industrial type pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7234)|
| 2:00:36| DFS wants to clean up this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7236)|
| 2:00:38| and attract several new job creating tenants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7238)|
| 2:00:41| make better use of the land and the subject parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7241)|
| 2:00:44| This permits public safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7244)|
| 2:00:46| and economic viability for the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7246)|
| 2:00:48| While DFS proposes only to use the simple driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7248)|
| 2:00:51| on the subject parcel, I recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7251)|
| 2:00:53| that you all must consider all possible uses of the parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7253)|
| 2:00:57| These are self-limiting by virtue of their size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7257)|
| 2:01:00| and limited area for expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7260)|
| 2:01:02| An established neighborhood is on one side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7262)|
| 2:01:04| and roads are on the other two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7264)|
| 2:01:06| Massive buildings, large scale industrial activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7266)|
| 2:01:09| or other uses simply would not have space to exist here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7269)|
| 2:01:13| Tractor trailers should not be a concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7273)|
| 2:01:16| as the offices serviced by the subject parcels driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7276)|
| 2:01:19| would not have loading docks or turnarounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7279)|
| 2:01:20| to accommodate such vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7280)|
| 2:01:22| I do not believe the changes we request would alter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7282)|
| 2:01:25| or permit others down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7285)|
| 2:01:27| to alter the existing use or character of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7287)|
| 2:01:31| DFS owns several properties in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7291)|
| 2:01:34| and prides itself on being a good landlord| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7294)|
| 2:01:35| and a good neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7295)|
| 2:01:37| Its buildings are regularly cleaned and maintained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7297)|
| 2:01:39| and a designated crew cleans up trash each week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7299)|
| 2:01:43| on its properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7303)|
| 2:01:44| Its current tenants are quality tenants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7304)|
| 2:01:46| one of which is the FBI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7306)|
| 2:01:48| Others are job creators and pillars in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7308)|
| 2:01:50| To my knowledge, nobody has objected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7310)|
| 2:01:52| to the proposed rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7312)|
| 2:01:54| To the contrary, I had a productive conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7314)|
| 2:01:57| with Councilwoman Seema Singh, who represents the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7317)|
| 2:02:00| and has indicated that she supports our changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7320)|
| 2:02:03| On that basis and on the basis that the changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7323)|
| 2:02:05| would better allow my client DFS to attract jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7325)|
| 2:02:09| to the community, to cleaned up the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7329)|
| 2:02:11| that is a public health concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210114?start=7331)|
