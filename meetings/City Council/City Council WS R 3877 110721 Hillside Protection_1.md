| 1:59:43| And I would just like to give one example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=7183)|
| 1:59:45| and I don't think this is out of reason to say this because it was said at a public meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=7185)|
| 1:59:51| but a lot of things have been said to promote hysteria, especially among property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=7191)|
| 2:00:00| A gentleman got up and said that a family had owned their land for many, many years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=7200)|
| 2:00:06| and now they were going to build their dream home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=7206)|
| 2:00:09| and they were not going to be able to because of this plan if it was put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=7209)|
| 2:00:13| And there were gasps in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=7213)|
| 2:00:15| And people talked to him afterwards and they said, you don't really believe that, do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=7215)|
| 2:00:19| And he admitted, no, I know that's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=7219)|
| 2:00:22| But to get up here and say that, I think you're going to have to have some way to say that's not a true thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=7222)|
| 2:00:30| or you're going to have to have some kind of rebuttal or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=7230)|
| 2:00:35| because that was said in one of the public meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=7235)|
| 2:00:38| and it was really terrible that people left here thinking that they would not be able to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=7238)|
| 2:00:46| And the last thing that I have to say is regarding what Rachel Craig said about the stakeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=7246)|
| 2:00:54| I hope that neighborhoods, prominent neighborhoods within the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=7254)|
| 2:00:58| and county will be included in discussions or ask about those measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=7258)|
| 2:01:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110721-hillside-protection?start=7264)|
