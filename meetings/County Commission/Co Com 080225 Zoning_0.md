| 0:04:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=269)|
| 0:04:30| Mr. Hicks, talk to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=270)|
| 0:04:35| I think this is one that I talked to some neighbors about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=275)|
| 0:04:38| They were interested in some sort of a berm, a fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=278)|
| 0:04:44| Is this the zoning that they called me about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=284)|
| 0:04:46| I knew it was an old Callaghan Road zoning that was coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=286)|
| 0:04:50| Is that yours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=290)|
| 0:04:51| Have you spoke with some neighbors about a fence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=291)|
| 0:04:53| Would you come down to the microphone, Mr. Hicks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=293)|
| 0:05:03| Give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=303)|
| 0:05:08| My name is Bob Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=308)|
| 0:05:10| I'm one of the applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=310)|
| 0:05:14| Address, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=314)|
| 0:05:15| 7848 Camberly Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=315)|
| 0:05:20| That's in Powell, 37849.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=320)|
| 0:05:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=325)|
| 0:05:26| Have you -- is this the one they called me several months ago when it was still at MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=326)|
| 0:05:31| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=331)|
| 0:05:32| That was Bill Hicks who talked to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=332)|
| 0:05:33| That was Bill Hicks that the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=333)|
| 0:05:36| And did you all agree to do the fence that they were wanting to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=336)|
| 0:05:41| When Bill talked to them, there was nothing mentioned about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=341)|
| 0:05:44| Nothing mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=344)|
| 0:05:45| Well, we may be talking about a completely different group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=345)|
| 0:05:47| I just they said they had this was a couple of months ago when this was in the early stages at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=347)|
| 0:05:55| And they said they had no opposition to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=355)|
| 0:05:57| And I'm not even sure if it was this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=357)|
| 0:06:00| But they said they'd like it if I would see that it was read into a record, the record that they were going to do a fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=360)|
| 0:06:05| So apparently this is not that piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=365)|
| 0:06:08| So I move we approve per MPC recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=368)|
| 0:06:14| The property moved and seconded to be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=374)|
| 0:06:17| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=377)|

| 0:06:20| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=380)|

| 0:06:37| The property is located on the southeast side of George Williams Road, northeast side of I-140,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=397)|

| 0:06:53| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=413)|
| 0:06:57| Mr. Chairman, I would ask that it be moved to the end of the agenda in case the applicant got tired of driving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=417)|
| 0:07:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=427)|
| 0:07:11| From page 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=431)|
| 0:07:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=434)|
| 0:07:16| The next two are requests of Butler Homes and Construction, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=436)|
| 0:07:20| The first is for a southwest county sector plan amendment from LDR low-density residential and SLPA slope protection area to MDR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=440)|
| 0:07:28| medium-density residential and SLPA slope protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=448)|
| 0:07:32| The second is for rezoning from A agricultural to PR plan residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=452)|
| 0:07:36| The properties are located on the northeast side of Gleason Drive, northeast of Ebenezer Road in the Fifth Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=456)|
| 0:07:43| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=463)|
| 0:07:45| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=465)|
| 0:07:50| I'd like to hear from MPC on their recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=470)|
| 0:07:55| Mr. Chair, as read by the clerk, you've got two requests here, Butler Homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=475)|
| 0:08:00| a sector plan amendment request and a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=480)|
| 0:08:04| The second sector plan amendment request is for low-density residential and slope protection to medium-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=484)|
| 0:08:10| and slope medium-density residential and slope protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=490)|
| 0:08:17| That request was denied by MPC by a vote of 11 to 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=497)|
| 0:08:21| And then a corresponding rezoning for plan residential zoning at, let's see, hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=501)|
| 0:08:34| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=514)|
| 0:08:36| Plan residential zoning at six-and-a-half dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=516)|
| 0:08:40| In looking at this request, the planning commission did take note of the surrounding development pattern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=520)|
| 0:08:46| It does include a range of residential uses, some medium-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=526)|
| 0:08:54| some plan residential at low densities, which is five to use per acre or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=534)|
| 0:09:01| You still have a little bit of agricultural zoning left in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=541)|
| 0:09:05| But this is an area that does have a wide range of uses, both low-density and residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=545)|
| 0:09:11| The site did have some topographic issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=551)|
| 0:09:16| but not as extensive as we sometimes see when we do a slope analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=556)|
| 0:09:23| What the planning commission did in looking at or hearing the testimony of the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=563)|
| 0:09:28| as well as the neighborhood, voted to deny the request for medium-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=568)|
| 0:09:37| And they voted to approve plan residential zoning at up to five dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=577)|
| 0:09:42| which is a low-density range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=582)|
| 0:09:48| And based on the testimony and the comments from the commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=588)|
| 0:09:53| I feel like that would be more in keeping with this site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=593)|
| 0:09:56| and would be conducive to some of the surrounding and adjacent development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=596)|
| 0:10:03| Would the opposition or the applicant like to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=603)|
| 0:10:05| Which one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=605)|
| 0:10:09| It matters not to us, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=609)|
| 0:10:14| We'll go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=614)|
| 0:10:15| I'll let him go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=615)|
| 0:10:18| Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=618)|
| 0:10:20| My name is Phillip Irwin, 8736 Heathwood Bend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=620)|
| 0:10:24| First of all, we have a few handouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=624)|
| 0:10:26| We mailed you commissioners' handouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=626)|
| 0:10:28| If anyone doesn't have a handout, if you'd raise your hand, we'd like to get you a handout that we mailed you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=628)|
| 0:10:34| Has everybody had it with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=634)|
| 0:10:35| Outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=635)|
| 0:10:37| You also have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=637)|
| 0:10:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=639)|
| 0:10:40| I'm the current president of the Briar Glen Home Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=640)|
| 0:10:43| And I appreciate you taking the time to hear our views today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=643)|
| 0:10:47| Let me first state that we are in no way trying to stand in the way of progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=647)|
| 0:10:52| We realize that growth is imminent in our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=652)|
| 0:10:55| However, the type of growth is one of our focal concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=655)|
| 0:10:58| We are not trying to dictate a landowner's rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=658)|
| 0:11:01| only expressing concern with the density level that's being proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=661)|
| 0:11:06| Gleason Road is now home to 12 condo and apartment developments in a one-mile stretch of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=666)|
| 0:11:12| As one member from the MPC stated in December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=672)|
| 0:11:15| when is enough condo development enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=675)|
| 0:11:19| Now, I'm confident that Mr. Butler and Mr. King are going to say these type of developments are in the area already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=679)|
| 0:11:24| And, yes, there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=684)|
| 0:11:26| It is our feeling there are too many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=686)|
| 0:11:29| Also, you're going to hear about the recommendation of the MPC at six-and-a-half units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=689)|
| 0:11:34| The key word, folks, is recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=694)|
| 0:11:37| The MPC, as this gentleman just indicated, voted for five units per acre, low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=697)|
| 0:11:45| To go to six-and-a-half units, which is what Mr. Butler is proposing, would say that the MPC was an error| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=705)|
| 0:11:53| and that our concerns don't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=713)|
| 0:11:56| It would also be in direct conflict with the Knox County master plan, which states this area LDR, low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=716)|
| 0:12:05| First of all, oversaturation has taken place in our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=725)|
| 0:12:10| I've always been taught that diversity is a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=730)|
| 0:12:14| It applies to schools, businesses, shopping malls, and also to housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=734)|
| 0:12:19| Just because condo development has invaded our area doesn't mean we have to keep perpetuating the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=739)|
| 0:12:27| Secondly, there is a concern of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=747)|
| 0:12:30| On this 1.1-mile stretch of road, it is not uncommon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=750)|
| 0:12:34| It's flanked by stop signs on both ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=754)|
| 0:12:37| It's not uncommon for backups to occur and almost meet in the middle going different directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=757)|
| 0:12:43| To widen that road would be virtually impossible because of the high density of condos in the area and housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=763)|
| 0:12:49| Traffic is a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=769)|
| 0:12:51| Putting 70 more families on these roads every day once again continues to accentuate the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=771)|
| 0:12:58| Thirdly, in an area that we feel like is extremely relevant and very painful to our residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=778)|
| 0:13:04| the last project that backed up to our neighborhood, the builder made several unkept promises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=784)|
| 0:13:10| to keep from having a zoning issue as we have here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=790)|
| 0:13:14| The builder deceived our residents and zoning was approved and then he did just as he wished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=794)|
| 0:13:20| The point is there is no accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=800)|
| 0:13:23| Now, I'm not judging Mr. Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=803)|
| 0:13:25| I'm not judging his ethics, his morals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=805)|
| 0:13:28| But we have found that bad experiences seem to follow some of these zoning disputes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=808)|
| 0:13:33| I'd like to share real quickly what happened in my home last Thursday evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=813)|
| 0:13:37| Mr. Butler contacted me and our membership to come to talk to us about a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=817)|
| 0:13:44| He agreed in his compromise to eliminate one unit and to plant some trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=824)|
| 0:13:51| First of all, our homeowners felt very uncomfortable with this meeting because it was not in any form a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=831)|
| 0:13:58| When questioned about what if he doesn't get his six-and-a-half units and is forced to build on five units or less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=838)|
| 0:14:05| Mr. Butler stated, and I quote, I'll just have to build a less appealing product, no street lights, no privacy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=845)|
| 0:14:14| no security entrance, and vinyl siding instead of brick or stone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=854)|
| 0:14:20| He wanted to compromise with us, but when we questioned his ability to build on five units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=860)|
| 0:14:27| in summary, he said, I'll build the units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=867)|
| 0:14:31| You don't have to like them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=871)|
| 0:14:32| You may not like them, but I'll still build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=872)|
| 0:14:35| It was very evident to all in attendance that he was maximizing his profits with no regards to our feelings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=875)|
| 0:14:41| Now, I ask you folks, did that sound like a compromise to you that I mentioned he deleted one unit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=881)|
| 0:14:49| Our membership perceived it as a poor presentation of leveraging against us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=889)|
| 0:14:55| and a desperate attempt for our opposition to go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=895)|
| 0:15:01| His attempt was unsuccessful, and that's why we're here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=901)|
| 0:15:05| What we're looking for, hopefully, is the visibility these units would create.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=905)|
| 0:15:09| Sixty-eight units, 80 feet high on a severe slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=909)|
| 0:15:16| Ladies and gentlemen, that would appear as an eight-story building upon completion, 300 yards wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=916)|
| 0:15:22| It would look like an apartment complex or even a college dormitory in our backyards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=922)|
| 0:15:28| I don't think you would like to look at this on a daily basis, nor would we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=928)|
| 0:15:32| We cannot make a mistake in your voting today that would cause our residents a feeling of wanting to sell their homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=932)|
| 0:15:39| for the last 10 or 20 years because their privacy is being compromised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=939)|
| 0:15:44| We're confident through your vote today you'll take that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=944)|
| 0:15:48| I know my time is drawing near, but there's one final issue, and that's the environmental issue of water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=948)|
| 0:15:55| It is in our opinion, and I know for the fact some of you, that if you do something that affects other people in a negative way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=955)|
| 0:16:02| then it's not the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=962)|
| 0:16:06| The county came out over 10 years ago and deemed that a culvert should be put in our drainage ditch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=966)|
| 0:16:12| However, 10 years later, we have a ditch that's twice as deep, in some areas 15 to 20 feet deep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=972)|
| 0:16:19| When it rains, it erodes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=979)|
| 0:16:22| It has provided a very dangerous situation for our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=982)|
| 0:16:26| I'm wrapping up, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=986)|
| 0:16:27| This development might have good drainage, but the water still must go somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=987)|
| 0:16:32| It will have over 10 acres of covered area with concrete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=992)|
| 0:16:36| That water will go somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=996)|
| 0:16:38| The land will not, as it is today, would not percolate and absorb the water as it does today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=998)|
| 0:16:46| We provided you pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1006)|
| 0:16:48| We have a water problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1008)|
| 0:16:51| In closing, where we are today is we have residents that are here in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1011)|
| 0:16:58| We have concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1018)|
| 0:16:59| We have issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1019)|
| 0:17:00| Please embrace our request to keep the zoning as low density, three units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1020)|
| 0:17:06| This does not change the MPC's ruling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1026)|
| 0:17:11| We can't change what has already been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1031)|
| 0:17:13| We cannot change the appeals that have been made in conflict with the master Knox County plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1033)|
| 0:17:20| But what we can do is we are responsible for the future from this point forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1040)|
| 0:17:25| All that we have asked for today still allows for development and homeowners' rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1045)|
| 0:17:30| On behalf of the parties represented here today in opposition, we thank you for your time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1050)|
| 0:17:35| your consideration, your views and concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| Thank you, Mr. Griffin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1058)|
| 0:17:39| Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1059)|
| 0:18:10| Mr. Chairman, members of the commission, I'm John King,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1090)|
| 0:18:15| Knox 2425 and Knoxville, Tennessee 37901 here on behalf of the applicant, Butler Holmes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1095)|
| 0:18:24| As stated before, you are going to hear from me about what the staff recommendation was at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1104)|
| 0:18:32| MPC, in looking at this, wrote a written analysis of their review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1112)|
| 0:18:40| The MPC staff recommended approval of our request for medium density designation of the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1120)|
| 0:18:48| and rezoning at six and a half dwelling units per acre as being compatible with the surrounding development and zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1128)|
| 0:18:56| which had developed at densities supported under the requested medium density residential sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1136)|
| 0:19:05| Immediately adjoining this piece of property is a piece that is zoned one to six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1145)|
| 0:19:11| and a half dwelling units per acre right across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1151)|
| 0:19:14| It's one to eight dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1154)|
| 0:19:17| And the staff analysis took all of that into account in making their request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1157)|
| 0:19:25| saying that the PR zoning at up to six and a half dwelling units per acre is compatible with the scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1165)|
| 0:19:30| and intensity of existing and proposed residential development and zoning pattern along this section of Gleason Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1170)|
| 0:19:38| With respect to Gleason Road, I will take issue with one of the things Mr. Irwin said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1178)|
| 0:19:46| Currently, Gleason Road has 66 feet of right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1186)|
| 0:19:52| The required dedication of additional right of way from my client and what's been dedicated on the other side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1192)|
| 0:19:57| I believe you're going to 80.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1197)|
| 0:19:59| It's either 84 or 88, 88 feet of right of way along Gleason Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1199)|
| 0:20:06| So far as I know, there are no current plans to widen Gleason Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1206)|
| 0:20:11| but certainly the existing roadway and the roadway right of way, the existing right of way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1211)|
| 0:20:19| and the proposed right of way that will be obtained by virtue of the required dedication of additional right of way is more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1219)|
| 0:20:26| than sufficient to widen Gleason Road if that is the desire of the county to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1226)|
| 0:20:33| I want to talk briefly about this Thursday meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1233)|
| 0:20:36| I wasn't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1236)|
| 0:20:37| I had to be elsewhere, and I know it took place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1237)|
| 0:20:41| There were two meetings, one that preceded Thursday's meeting where Mr. Butler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1241)|
| 0:20:47| after the last postponement, went to a meeting of the Homeowners Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1247)|
| 0:20:51| and asked to hear their concerns, issues, questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1251)|
| 0:20:55| And there were three general areas that they identified as areas of concern, that being, number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1255)|
| 0:21:02| the landscaping along the rear of our property, the issue of a solid back wall to the development of the condominiums| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1262)|
| 0:21:14| at the rear with a suggestion that in some fashion that be broken up to give a visual break in the look of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1274)|
| 0:21:22| and the issue about water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1282)|
| 0:21:24| He went back Thursday and he told them, I can break this building in the back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1284)|
| 0:21:30| I will have three different buildings of four units to each building, which gives you two breaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1290)|
| 0:21:37| And the consequence of that is I lose one dwelling unit by doing so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1297)|
| 0:21:42| He further said that in regard to the issue of landscaping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1302)|
| 0:21:46| the ditch that is referred to is located entirely within our property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1306)|
| 0:21:52| and there's beyond that ditch to the rear boundary of our property, there's 30 to 35 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1312)|
| 0:21:58| And he said in that area he would put in eight-foot high Leland cypresses on eight to ten-foot centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1318)|
| 0:22:05| to give them additional landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1325)|
| 0:22:07| With regard to the water, what he said was the truth is that Knox County now has much more stringent standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1327)|
| 0:22:15| for dealing with surface water, drainage issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1335)|
| 0:22:19| pointing out to them that we will be constructing two detention facilities on our property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1339)|
| 0:22:24| with the responsibility of those being maintained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1344)|
| 0:22:27| And the consequent result, that water will be released from those detention facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1347)|
| 0:22:32| to go into the drainage way at no greater rate than currently exists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1352)|
| 0:22:37| and it is believed by the engineer and my client that not only will we not be adding any problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1357)|
| 0:22:45| we will be improving the existing situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1365)|
| 0:22:53| With regard to the other comments, what my client said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1373)|
| 0:22:59| and we're going to stick to our word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1379)|
| 0:23:02| What we said we would like to do in exchange for our willingness to do those kind of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1382)|
| 0:23:06| and yet still be able to build the type of facility we would like to build,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1386)|
| 0:23:11| we would request that they not oppose our request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1391)|
| 0:23:14| and we would reduce our request for density to six dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1394)|
| 0:23:19| after having figured it with the sharpest pencil possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1399)|
| 0:23:23| You have one minute, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| You didn't say that, but we're still willing to stick to that commitment to do those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1404)|
| 0:23:29| and we're willing to amend our request to six dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1409)|
| 0:23:37| One other thing, very briefly, if I may, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1417)|
| 0:23:43| The concern over possible effect on Briar Glen, the neighboring subdivision to the rear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1423)|
| 0:23:52| whose properties bound ours to the rear of theirs, I did some checking on information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1432)|
| 0:24:01| public information that's readily available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1441)|
| 0:24:04| Since the development of Anderson Ridge, which is the property he's talking about where there were promises made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1444)|
| 0:24:11| and not kept, it wasn't by my client, nor was I involved in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1451)|
| 0:24:16| but it's somebody else, and I can't speak for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1456)|
| 0:24:19| I can only speak for Mr. Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1459)|
| 0:24:21| He says what he's going to do, and he will do what he says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1461)|
| 0:24:24| But since the development of Anderson Ridge in Briar Glen, there have been sales of properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1464)|
| 0:24:32| and I believe those sales figures accurately reflect that there has been no deterioration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1472)|
| 0:24:37| or detriment suffered as far as values are concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| There was a recent sale in September of 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1481)|
| 0:24:46| The prior sale had been nine years earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1486)|
| 0:24:48| That most recent sale since the development of Anderson Ridge, the sale nine years ago was at $312,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1488)|
| 0:24:56| The sale in September of 2006 was $469,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1496)|
| 0:25:01| I would submit to you that is a substantial increase in value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1501)|
| 0:25:05| Mr. King, you need to wrap it up, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1505)|
| 0:25:07| Just two more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1507)|
| 0:25:08| One other property sold in July of 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1508)|
| 0:25:12| It had sold four years prior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| It increased from $389,000 to $470,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1514)|
| 0:25:19| And all of these sales now are subsequent to Anderson Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1519)|
| 0:25:23| The last one is the most graphic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1523)|
| 0:25:26| There was a sale in January of 2007, the most recent sale being in September of 2007, nine months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1526)|
| 0:25:34| The property increased in value from $485,000 to $542,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1534)|
| 0:25:40| I suggest to you that development of condominiums in this location is an appropriate development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1540)|
| 0:25:46| It deals with the issue of sprawl and the density we request is in keeping with the density in the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1546)|
| 0:25:53| We would appreciate your support of this rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1553)|
| 0:25:57| And it will take a plan amendment to go to medium density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1557)|
| 0:26:02| We request six dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1562)|
| 0:26:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1565)|
| 0:26:06| Commissioner Hammond, do you want to ask the question now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1566)|
| 0:26:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1569)|
| 0:26:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1570)|
| 0:26:11| Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1571)|
| 0:26:12| Buzz, with regards to the slope, I see where that you're saying that 6.3 percent of the site has slopes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1572)|
| 0:26:18| 25 percent or greater, 40 percent has slopes between 15 and 20 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1578)|
| 0:26:22| Realistically, on this 12 acres, and I guess Mr. King might want to weigh in on this as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1582)|
| 0:26:26| realistically, how many acres can he build on since it is a 12-acre tract with the slopes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1586)|
| 0:26:54| Rough guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1614)|
| 0:26:56| Of course, you eliminate the little over 6 percent, which is not quite an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1616)|
| 0:27:05| Mr. Hammond, it would be, you know, just a best and educated guess, I would say eight to nine to 10 percent of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1625)|
| 0:27:17| It depends on how he lays it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1637)|
| 0:27:19| As I say, this didn't appear to have the constraints that we might see when it looks like that you do have a slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1639)|
| 0:27:27| that slopes from the street back to the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| It didn't end up being in our slope analysis as bad as we thought it was going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1650)|
| 0:27:35| I'm giving you a very rough guess there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| So you're looking at about an acre and a half that will so you take that off the 12, you're looking at 10 and a half?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1658)|
| 0:27:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1668)|
| 0:27:50| Yes, I'm just trying to get an idea of the land mass there of the actual build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1670)|
| 0:27:54| About 10 and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1674)|
| 0:27:56| They had mentioned earlier that previous developers had come in and made promises that hadn't been kept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1676)|
| 0:28:01| And I noticed that one of the things that you mentioned here is that they would need to comply with all of the rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1681)|
| 0:28:08| regulations, and so forth with regards to slopes and all of the rules and regulations that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1688)|
| 0:28:15| For their sake, I guess you might say, what do you do to make sure that the developer will go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1695)|
| 0:28:23| and do what they say they will do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1703)|
| 0:28:26| Well, the MPC and the MPC staff, well, primarily MPC, with what they approve in the development plan process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1706)|
| 0:28:34| they're approving plans that hopefully conform to whatever regulations apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1714)|
| 0:28:43| And after we approve it, not to say that we don't have any more responsibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1723)|
| 0:28:49| but we're essentially out of the picture in terms of whether or not those recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1729)|
| 0:28:55| those conditions are, in fact, implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1735)|
| 0:28:58| So when we review a plan, we take all of our requirements, all of our regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1738)|
| 0:29:05| We have input from county engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| In some cases, we'll have input from the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1748)|
| 0:29:12| Input from the fire marshal's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1752)|
| 0:29:15| Weighing all those factors, coming up with a recommendation, looking at all the regulations that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1755)|
| 0:29:20| We'll make that recommendation in terms of approval of a site plan that will list conditions of approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1760)|
| 0:29:28| As to whether or not they're followed through with, we as MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1768)|
| 0:29:35| we're not in the position of going back and making sure that those are enforced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1775)|
| 0:29:40| or those conditions have been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| Now, every now and then somebody will call us and they'll say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1782)|
| 0:29:46| I thought I remembered at MPC back in 2007 that there was supposed to be a ten-foot landscape strip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1786)|
| 0:29:52| We will go out and take a look at that, look at it against the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1792)|
| 0:29:56| and then make a finding to codes for them to follow through with any kind of enforcement action that is called for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1796)|
| 0:30:05| Bruce, how aggressive is codes in making sure that these things are followed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1805)|
| 0:30:09| Commissioner Hammond, typically what will happen is a performance bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1809)|
| 0:30:12| Once a development is approved, a performance bond will be put in place with Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1812)|
| 0:30:17| which would cover such things as drainage improvements, landscaping, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1817)|
| 0:30:22| Typically, things that we do not cover are going to be siding, whether it's vinyl or brick or things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1822)|
| 0:30:26| But certainly anything that's done with landscaping, any drainage improvements, road improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1826)|
| 0:30:31| things of that nature are covered by a performance bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| And with the addition of the new inspectors we have, we're doing a much better job of following through with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1834)|
| 0:30:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1839)|
| 0:30:40| My final question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1840)|
| 0:30:41| Mr. Irwin, you mentioned something about five units when you were talking in your presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1841)|
| 0:30:48| Would you accept five units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1848)|
| 0:30:50| It is the wishes of our residents of three units or less, and in my rebuttal I'll explain why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1850)|
| 0:30:58| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1858)|
| 0:31:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1860)|
| 0:31:01| This may be a question for Bruce or Buzz or Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1861)|
| 0:31:04| We're talking about the ditch here, and it's what, a 12-foot ditch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1864)|
| 0:31:10| Bruce, what can they do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1870)|
| 0:31:12| Can they put riprap in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| I mean, what's open for them to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| How can they remedy some of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1877)|
| 0:31:19| I need to tell you, I'm not personally familiar with this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1879)|
| 0:31:22| Other members of my staff, we usually don't get involved until after rezoning takes place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1882)|
| 0:31:27| It's something that's difficult to say without taking a complete comprehensive look at the ditch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1887)|
| 0:31:31| And also what the end result, what they're actually looking for as an end result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1891)|
| 0:31:36| There's various things that can be done with everything from piping or armoring, i.e., riprap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1896)|
| 0:31:41| There's various things that can be done with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| Well, wouldn't the county then, if I was building on that, wouldn't you want me to stop that from eroding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1903)|
| 0:31:48| Because it sounds like it's done quite a bit of eroding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| You would want the developer to try to put riprap or something in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1910)|
| 0:31:55| If there already is an existing erosion problem, yes, we would want that channel stabilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1915)|
| 0:31:59| And, Mr. King, I don't know if you all are going to address that or that may be something later down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1919)|
| 0:32:05| May I say something, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1925)|
| 0:32:07| Not at this time, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1927)|
| 0:32:09| I have a question for Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1929)|
| 0:32:11| We'll get to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1931)|
| 0:32:15| As I think probably most everybody up there knows that in rezoning to plan residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1935)|
| 0:32:23| there will be a required concept plan in use on review, i.e., a development plan proposed for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1943)|
| 0:32:30| Drainage, traffic, compliance with the regs on hillside development, those kind of issues are dealt with at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1950)|
| 0:32:45| And I assume we'll be the subject of discussion as it relates to the approval of such a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1965)|
| 0:32:54| There has currently been submitted to MPC a development plan, a concept plan in use on review for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1974)|
| 0:33:02| It is being revised now, and that revised plan will be filed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1982)|
| 0:33:06| reflecting what I said about the building to the rear of the project separating that building with two visual breaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1986)|
| 0:33:15| Other than what Bruce said, I believe, do I recall correctly that once the work that you were talking about is done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=1995)|
| 0:33:24| they have to give you an as-built plan before the bond release can be achieved so that not only do you have the regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2004)|
| 0:33:34| and tell you what you've got to put in, but then you have to, once you've done it, give them an as-built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2014)|
| 0:33:39| and they have to go out and check it and so forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| and make sure that that's been done before the bond release is accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2021)|
| 0:33:46| That's just one of my concerns on the project is, you know, the pictures that I've seen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2026)|
| 0:33:50| the turbidity and stuff that you have there, and I would hope that this would, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2030)|
| 0:33:54| we've got to just eat away at that soil and make sure that if we can stop that, that's a big plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2034)|
| 0:34:01| Just a question I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2041)|
| 0:34:02| Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2042)|
| 0:34:04| I have a question here because Mr. King just referenced two sale prices of substantial value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2044)|
| 0:34:09| the sale prices you mentioned earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| Yet, when I go to the property assessor's office, the map department, the ownership card,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2051)|
| 0:34:16| I see sale prices of zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2056)|
| 0:34:18| Can you explain the discrepancy between that record and what you cited?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2058)|
| 0:34:22| I don't know which particular pieces of property you may be talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2062)|
| 0:34:25| but there may be some that were built and haven't been sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2065)|
| 0:34:29| I've got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| I've got to know that on the property assessor's records,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2070)|
| 0:34:36| at least what I've been able to find out in looking at the various properties back there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2076)|
| 0:34:42| I think an average price on the units or homes back there from the property assessor's office standpoint is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2082)|
| 0:34:49| about $407,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2089)|
| 0:34:51| I'm just looking at the owner report card available from KGIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2091)|
| 0:34:55| Can you explain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2095)|
| 0:34:56| I don't know which particular piece of property you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| Well, listed here at 8821 Gleason, is that the owner's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2098)|
| 0:35:02| Well, the property values, I think that may be the property you're talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2102)|
| 0:35:09| What I was talking about was property in Briar Glen subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2112)|
| 0:35:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2113)|
| 0:35:14| In other words, Briar Glen abuts us from the rear of our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2114)|
| 0:35:19| There have been three sales of properties in Briar Glen, two of which are bounding along that rear boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2119)|
| 0:35:28| I thought you were referencing the specific property itself in sale, but as long as that's clarified, I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2128)|
| 0:35:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2134)|
| 0:35:35| It is odd that it was transferred twice at zero value, but thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2135)|
| 0:35:38| Commissioner Luto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2138)|
| 0:35:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2141)|
| 0:35:43| Because it's my understanding that they're going to keep an acre of this 12 acres with an existing house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2143)|
| 0:35:57| That won't be part of this development to begin with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2157)|
| 0:36:00| That appears to be what's reflected on the site plan, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2160)|
| 0:36:04| So when we start talking about units per acre, are we talking about multiplying times 11 or 12?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2164)|
| 0:36:13| You might need to get that clarified from the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2173)|
| 0:36:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2175)|
| 0:36:16| We're talking about 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| That piece of property, that one acre where the house remains, will remain there for the immediately foreseeable future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2178)|
| 0:36:28| At a point in time after that occupant leaves that premises, then it would be taken down and utilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2188)|
| 0:36:36| So if you do, let's say, you set the density per, you know, so many dwelling units per acre, it includes that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2196)|
| 0:36:48| but that one will remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| You'll only be developing enough that you will still have that many units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2210)|
| 0:36:56| Well, let's just use the number of, say if it was six just for a number, then if you developed 11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2216)|
| 0:37:04| are you talking about 66 units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2224)|
| 0:37:07| Well, the easiest way I know how to explain it would be like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2227)|
| 0:37:10| If you leave that acre out and you have six dwelling units per acre and you have 72,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2230)|
| 0:37:15| and you're going to put four units where that acre is, then what you would be permitted to build would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2235)|
| 0:37:22| Up front, you'd be able to develop the 66, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2242)|
| 0:37:26| That's 11 times 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2248)|
| 0:37:31| Of course, you don't lose anything because you've got some slope problems there because when Buzz says that there's an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2251)|
| 0:37:39| acre and a half of unusable or unbuildable acreage there, you don't lose that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2259)|
| 0:37:45| You just get to push those units to other parts of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2265)|
| 0:37:49| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2269)|
| 0:37:51| Well, again, I think most of the people who are familiar with doing this, as I know you are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2271)|
| 0:37:58| the reason for the existence of the planned residential designation is that it is designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2278)|
| 0:38:08| so that you can develop on properties that have some constraints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2288)|
| 0:38:12| in the sense of you get a certain number of units per acre and the entire acreage is involved in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2292)|
| 0:38:18| but you then can build on only a portion of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2298)|
| 0:38:23| You don't necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| It allows you to cluster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2305)|
| 0:38:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2306)|
| 0:38:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2307)|
| 0:38:28| I've got a question for Bruce Weichert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2308)|
| 0:38:35| Bruce, it's my understanding this will be a they'll have private roads in there instead of county roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2315)|
| 0:38:42| Commissioner, quite frankly, I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| Well, they've talked about a gated community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2324)|
| 0:38:46| So if it was a gated community, then it would have to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2328)|
| 0:38:52| Since I'm not an expert on our new stormwater ordinance that we just passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2332)|
| 0:38:58| what would be the difference between how that they collect and channel their water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2338)|
| 0:39:05| between it being a county road versus private roads in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2345)|
| 0:39:10| None whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2350)|
| 0:39:11| None whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2351)|
| 0:39:12| Other than the fact that a private road is typically going to be 22 feet in width| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2352)|
| 0:39:17| and a public road is 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| Other than the width difference, the stormwater provisions and requirements are exactly the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2359)|
| 0:39:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2363)|
| 0:39:24| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2364)|
| 0:39:27| Actually, I'd like to hear what William has to say first, and then I'd like to make my comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2367)|
| 0:39:32| Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2372)|
| 0:39:36| Buzz, what is the acceptable slope for a county road, a road that the county is going to take over from a developer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2376)|
| 0:39:43| I know this is a private road, but what's the acceptable slope or grade?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2383)|
| 0:39:48| Bruce might be able to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| The minimum grade without a variance, excuse me, the maximum grade without a variance is 12 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2390)|
| 0:39:55| The maximum grade allowable with a variance is up to 15 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2395)|
| 0:40:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2400)|
| 0:40:01| And, Buzz, what's the slope of this property or the grade of this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2401)|
| 0:40:15| Where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2415)|
| 0:40:16| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2416)|
| 0:40:18| I can't give you an overall slope, but I can tell you, and we've included in the packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2418)|
| 0:40:23| 54, approximately 54 percent has slopes less than 15 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2423)|
| 0:40:29| Thirty-nine, approximately 39.5 percent of the site or a little over five acres has slope between 15 and 25 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2429)|
| 0:40:40| And then less than an acre has a slope greater than 25 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2440)|
| 0:40:53| Are you through, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2453)|
| 0:40:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2454)|
| 0:40:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2455)|
| 0:40:56| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2456)|
| 0:40:57| With regard to Anderson Ridge that is built next door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2457)|
| 0:41:01| is the grade or the slope any different than the grade or the slope of this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2461)|
| 0:41:14| As I recall, the slope, and I could be corrected on this, as you go from southeast to southwest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2474)|
| 0:41:26| the slope gets a little more pronounced as you get closer to Ebenezer Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2486)|
| 0:41:34| The land is a little bit more flat toward the northeast end versus the southwest end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2494)|
| 0:41:41| So Anderson Ridge then, which is closest to Ebenezer Road, is actually a higher grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2501)|
| 0:41:46| or slope than the property in question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2506)|
| 0:41:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2510)|
| 0:41:51| The other way around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2511)|
| 0:41:52| The other way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2512)|
| 0:41:55| If you don't have a colored slope map that's not in your packet, it's safe to say it's probably comparable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2515)|
| 0:42:04| It may be a little bit greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2524)|
| 0:42:07| But it tends to, in general, make that transition from northeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2527)|
| 0:42:14| You know, I'm giving you, I didn't pay close attention to the other, you know, to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2534)|
| 0:42:22| So I'm giving you as best guess as I can give you without having to look at it in detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2542)|
| 0:42:27| Buzz, I believe the other property is less of a grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2547)|
| 0:42:33| It's not as steep as this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| It could be, and I'm glad to be corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2555)|
| 0:42:41| Just the other thing I'd like to comment is I live over in this area, and I drive on Gleason Road all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2561)|
| 0:42:47| I live over off Gallaher View.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| And in looking at this property and driving down Gleason Road, I went at the four-way stop from Gallaher to Gleason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2569)|
| 0:42:58| And if you're sitting there at that four-way, you have the Bread Box, you have Cedar Springs Apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2578)|
| 0:43:06| you have Copper Point Apartments, and you have the Palisades Condos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2586)|
| 0:43:10| Those units, there's probably, I'd say, 200-plus condominium units in Palisades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2590)|
| 0:43:16| And just if you turn west onto Gleason and drive down Gleason, the number of units that I counted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2596)|
| 0:43:23| and Mr. Irwin commented about it, there are an exorbitant amount of condo developments in through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2603)|
| 0:43:31| I don't think that this development is inconsistent with those developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2611)|
| 0:43:36| I think that Mr. Butler is going to try to make a quality product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2616)|
| 0:43:41| I would like to see it developed at five units per acre, but I recommend that it goes forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2621)|
| 0:43:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2626)|
| 0:43:48| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| I have two comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2630)|
| 0:43:51| I have been out to the site and my eyeball impression is that the Anderson Ridge subdivision just definitely does not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2631)|
| 0:43:59| the same slope as this proposed land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2639)|
| 0:44:03| I have a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2643)|
| 0:44:04| One has to do with the southwest county sector plan that proposes low-density residential use for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2644)|
| 0:44:12| I know that the precedent over the last 25 or 30 years has been to get a variance on that to medium-density residential use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2652)|
| 0:44:21| And I was really wondering what exactly is the southwest county sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2661)|
| 0:44:27| and why has that been pretty much ignored when we're looking at zoning issues in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2667)|
| 0:44:32| That's one of my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2672)|
| 0:44:33| And the second question has to do with the, and I'll call it the catchment basin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2673)|
| 0:44:37| which is supposed to take the water off of this slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2677)|
| 0:44:41| And I think when you do put a lot of concrete there, you change the percolation of the ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2681)|
| 0:44:46| and the amount of rain that it takes to run off so much is, you know, less rain has more runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2686)|
| 0:44:52| In other words, how effective are these catchment basins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2692)|
| 0:44:55| And over time, is there a problem with those silting up to where it doesn't percolate the way that it should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2695)|
| 0:45:01| and you start to have more problems with rain runoff into that ditch, which is a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2701)|
| 0:45:07| The day that I visited that area was after what I would call a very medium rain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2707)|
| 0:45:12| It wasn't a heavy rain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| And there was considerable water flow through that ditch that we talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2714)|
| 0:45:19| And, you know, just looking at it, I would have concerns also of that being, I guess you would call it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2719)|
| 0:45:24| an attractive nuisance to kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| I know how little boys are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2726)|
| 0:45:28| And those are just some of the concerns I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2728)|
| 0:45:32| But the two questions, one is about the southwest county sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2732)|
| 0:45:37| and why has there been so many variances on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| And then the second question is about the catchment basins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2739)|
| 0:45:45| Taking them in inverse order since I'm already up here, the first thing, as I said about the drainage ditch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2745)|
| 0:45:53| first of all, understand it is entirely on our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2753)|
| 0:45:56| In looking at the area that abuts us to the rear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2756)|
| 0:46:02| I noticed that there are at least some, if not all, of the homes from Briar Glen have fencing around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2762)|
| 0:46:08| or at the rear of their properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2768)|
| 0:46:10| If it's one, I think there are about three, maybe four houses across the rear that actually abut this property from Briar Glen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2770)|
| 0:46:20| I may be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2780)|
| 0:46:21| I may be one more, but I'm saying three, four, maybe five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2781)|
| 0:46:25| Somebody out here is saying six, so it's six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2785)|
| 0:46:28| I don't know, but I say I observed that there was some fencing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2788)|
| 0:46:32| If it is an issue about the safety of children, as part of the plan's review and approval of our development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2792)|
| 0:46:41| fencing can be required of us, and we are perfectly willing to do that if it's a requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2801)|
| 0:46:47| As I said, there will be two detention facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2807)|
| 0:46:50| I believe the engineer that's working on this project is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2810)|
| 0:46:54| and I prefer to let him discuss technically how the water issue will be dealt with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2814)|
| 0:46:59| and what those requirements now are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2819)|
| 0:47:17| MPC staff would be the one to respond, perhaps, to the second plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2837)|
| 0:47:21| Part of the process that we use now, as opposed to several years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2841)|
| 0:47:26| and this is I think has been in existence since we had the adoption of what's called a growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2846)|
| 0:47:32| is we make it a practice to bring sector plan amendments to the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2852)|
| 0:47:37| as well as to this body for consideration prior to a rezoning that is not consistent with the sector plan at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2857)|
| 0:47:45| so that you hopefully have a discussion about the planning issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2865)|
| 0:47:49| And then once that's determined, then you move on to the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2869)|
| 0:47:53| The rezoning is decided based upon your decision on the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2873)|
| 0:47:59| This particular pattern has developed over the years in looking at it and looking at the zoning in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2879)|
| 0:48:06| You do have a wide range of densities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2886)|
| 0:48:08| You have a wide range of housing types all the way from the large lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2888)|
| 0:48:13| You still have some very, very large lot development, even larger than Briar Glen in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2893)|
| 0:48:19| You have the Briar Glen subdivision, very large single family lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2899)|
| 0:48:23| All the way down to the condominium and attached development that you have on the south side of Gleason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2903)|
| 0:48:30| As to why the sector plan, in some people's eyes, has not been followed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2910)|
| 0:48:39| I don't know that I can give you a good answer other than those decisions are made in public body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2919)|
| 0:48:45| and public discussion have been over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2925)|
| 0:48:48| As I say, I'm not familiar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2928)|
| 0:48:50| I don't have the institutional memory to go back and to give you all the background of what, why, and where.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2930)|
| 0:48:57| In looking at the zoning pattern, it probably at some point would be a very good idea to relook the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2937)|
| 0:49:06| to possibly identify some of those zonings that have taken place that are not consistent with what's out there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2946)|
| 0:49:13| So I don't know if that's an answer that you're looking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2953)|
| 0:49:17| but that's the best answer I can give, you know, in terms of why, what, and where.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2957)|
| 0:49:25| Give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2965)|
| 0:49:27| My name is David Campbell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2967)|
| 0:49:29| I'm a consulting engineer, and my address is 325 Wooded Lane, Knoxville, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2969)|
| 0:49:35| I can address both the slope issues, the topography, as well as the drainage issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2975)|
| 0:49:39| We do have a spot of land, and it shows up prominently on KGIS, where our land slopes are greater than 25 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2979)|
| 0:49:46| It's a very compact area, maybe a 100 by 200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2986)|
| 0:49:49| The great news there is that we can take the slopes, the 3 or 4 percent slopes above| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2989)|
| 0:49:54| and the 3 or 4 percent slopes below, grade out the 25 percent and end up with a 5 or 6 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=2994)|
| 0:50:00| That's the beauty of how we can work with the slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3000)|
| 0:50:03| If the whole property were like that, we would not be here right now, speaking as we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3003)|
| 0:50:07| Since a small portion of it is, we can grade around that and make it work very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3007)|
| 0:50:11| Anderson Ridge had similar kind of difficulties, although maybe not as steep as here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3011)|
| 0:50:16| We've already prepared a grading plan that shows that we can accommodate that sloped area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3016)|
| 0:50:21| With regard to the drainage, it's certainly true that you can take an area, a field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3021)|
| 0:50:26| and convert it into rooftops and asphalt, that it will not percolate the way it did before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3026)|
| 0:50:31| and that we have greater rates of runoff after development than prior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3031)|
| 0:50:35| That's why we use these large basins to hold the water and let it out very slowly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3035)|
| 0:50:39| With regard, Commissioner Briggs, regarding percolation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3039)|
| 0:50:44| percolation is not real effective in East Tennessee soil, so we don't rely on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3044)|
| 0:50:49| Percolation in soils, especially on these kind of slopes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3049)|
| 0:50:52| is not a real great percentage of the rainfall becomes percolation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3052)|
| 0:50:57| and we aren't relying on percolation to serve the needs of this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3057)|
| 0:51:02| It will just strictly be held and then released over a period of somewhere between 24 and 48 hours after rainfall ceases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3062)|
| 0:51:10| Commissioner Roundtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3070)|
| 0:51:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3072)|
| 0:51:13| I have two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3073)|
| 0:51:14| First question for Mr. Irwin, and then I'd like to ask Mr. Weitrick a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3074)|
| 0:51:21| Mr. Irwin, I received this package at my home, and I looked through the pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3081)|
| 0:51:27| Could you tell me when these photographs were made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3087)|
| 0:51:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3090)|
| 0:51:31| They were taken three weeks ago today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3091)|
| 0:51:32| On that day, there was less than one inch of rainfall in the area, three weeks ago today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3092)|
| 0:51:38| Thank you for pointing that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3098)|
| 0:51:40| I was going to mention that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3100)|
| 0:51:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3101)|
| 0:51:41| Bruce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3101)|
| 0:51:46| What's been the history of flooding in the Peters Road, Ten Mile Creek area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3106)|
| 0:51:51| I'm not familiar with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3111)|
| 0:51:53| It's typically more along the lines of sinkhole flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3113)|
| 0:51:56| You certainly have some local isolated flooding within subdivisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3116)|
| 0:52:01| but typically when I have the most serious events is usually when you're into an extended period of rain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3121)|
| 0:52:06| We'll end up getting the sinkhole situation out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3126)|
| 0:52:09| That entire drainage basin essentially drains by a sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3129)|
| 0:52:13| I get backups from the sinkhole, creating lake effects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3133)|
| 0:52:16| In fact, in some cases, I have to close roads in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3136)|
| 0:52:19| Do you know how often in the last three or four years that you've had to close that road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3139)|
| 0:52:26| I think I've had road closures since I've been working here at least four times that I personally can recollect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3146)|
| 0:52:32| and probably the last 15, 20 years that we've actually had to shut down various roads out in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3152)|
| 0:52:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3159)|
| 0:52:43| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3163)|
| 0:52:44| I don't know if any of the homeowners can address this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3164)|
| 0:52:47| but with regard to the ditch and the safety of the ditch, have you brought any of your concerns about that prior to this zoning issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3167)|
| 0:52:56| Have you brought that to the property owner to say, your ditch is eroding, can you please do something about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3176)|
| 0:53:03| We're concerned about the safety of our children, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3183)|
| 0:53:06| That's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3186)|
| 0:53:07| We were hopeful after this issue with the new staff and commissioners that we would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3187)|
| 0:53:14| But up to this point, to my knowledge, Laura, I've only lived in there four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3194)|
| 0:53:21| Someone else has lived there longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3201)|
| 0:53:22| Laura?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3202)|
| 0:53:25| Do you want to ask one of them the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3205)|
| 0:53:29| So, to your knowledge, Mr. Irwin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3209)|
| 0:53:32| in the four-year period that you've been the homeowner president or the president of the homeowners association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3212)|
| 0:53:37| you've just been president one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3217)|
| 0:53:39| You have not contacted the owner with regard to the safety or the security of your kids with regard to this ditch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3219)|
| 0:53:45| or the coming up on your property or any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3225)|
| 0:53:48| Have you had any damage from this ditch, flood damage, water damage, with regard to this ditch to your property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3228)|
| 0:53:54| I have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3234)|
| 0:53:55| I am the one home that has fencing along this back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3235)|
| 0:53:59| So, my children, my child, my property is protected, but that is the only one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3239)|
| 0:54:05| As far as any other communication, I have not had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3245)|
| 0:54:12| Commissioner DeFreeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3252)|
| 0:54:14| My name is Laura.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3254)|
| 0:54:15| Hold on one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3255)|
| 0:54:16| Do you want to ask that question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3256)|
| 0:54:17| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3257)|
| 0:54:18| If you can answer my question, I'd appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3258)|
| 0:54:20| My name is Laura Carol Kinzel, and I've been in the neighborhood for six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3260)|
| 0:54:24| Address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3264)|
| 0:54:25| 8840 Rosemont Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3265)|
| 0:54:29| I've been in the neighborhood for 16 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3269)|
| 0:54:31| I've built my home, a custom home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| I am directly behind Anderson Ridge Apartments, which I've addressed the MPC about the concerns that I had over the water issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3273)|
| 0:54:42| even before that went in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3282)|
| 0:54:45| I can't even tell you how much my property has eroded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3285)|
| 0:54:49| My property does go over the ditch, and I actually jumped the ditch and I asked the builder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3289)|
| 0:54:56| I had the big concern over the water issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3296)|
| 0:54:59| When I moved in, the property, the year that I built my home, which was 16 years ago, we had tremendous rainfall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3299)|
| 0:55:06| We couldn't even get our basement dug to get our home built a little faster because of the rain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3306)|
| 0:55:13| That ditch did not have relatively any water in that ditch, and I have three sons I've raised in that home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3313)|
| 0:55:20| At this point now, my husband is 6'3".| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3320)|
| 0:55:23| His head, if he stands in the ditch, it is eroded so far, and the current is so powerful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3323)|
| 0:55:31| An adult, if you were to fall in that water, you would be under the viaduct down underneath Ebenezer Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3331)|
| 0:55:39| It's that much of an issue for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3339)|
| 0:55:42| I have 100-year-old trees in my backyard now that we have had already had to have cut down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3342)|
| 0:55:49| and one that right now is huge that is really a concern that I'm going to lose that tree because, again, of the water erosion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3349)|
| 0:55:58| So what did MPC say then at that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3358)|
| 0:56:01| We asked them to come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3361)|
| 0:56:02| Again, this was, I'm not sure, several years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3362)|
| 0:56:06| The cost was just a tremendous amount in order for anybody to do anything to help with the erosion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3366)|
| 0:56:13| And, of course, this was before, again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3373)|
| 0:56:16| I know that we can talk about retention ponds and detention ponds, but when you were releasing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3376)|
| 0:56:21| when you have at that time about 24 acres up above our subdivision and it was all just land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3381)|
| 0:56:29| it was not anywhere near the problem that it's become because, again, it has to drain somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3389)|
| 0:56:37| The roofs and the concrete, there is not any absorption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3397)|
| 0:56:42| So it's just the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3402)|
| 0:56:43| It was just a tremendous amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3403)|
| 0:56:45| The cost to you or the cost to the developer or whose cost was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3405)|
| 0:56:48| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3408)|
| 0:56:49| This wasn't to the developer at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3409)|
| 0:56:50| This was just as they were developing up on Gleason Road, we started noticing just how much the water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3410)|
| 0:56:56| and the tremendous amount that used to be just a small little tiny amount, wouldn't even be considered a stream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3416)|
| 0:57:02| that now is just a river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3422)|
| 0:57:05| So the county, it's been different things that we've talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3425)|
| 0:57:08| Was it the county, Jack?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3428)|
| 0:57:09| The county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3429)|
| 0:57:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3430)|
| 0:57:11| Commissioner DeFries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3431)|
| 0:57:13| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3433)|
| 0:57:14| My comment is more geared to Dr. Briggs, and there are several of us who are new on commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3434)|
| 0:57:20| and we might need Buzz to help us out with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3440)|
| 0:57:23| But with the urban growth plan being adopted back in 2002, at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3443)|
| 0:57:28| the sector plans were just mere advisory status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3448)|
| 0:57:31| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3451)|
| 0:57:33| As I recall, they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3453)|
| 0:57:35| They were treated more as a, I think, the documents were received by a commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3455)|
| 0:57:39| but I think they were more advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3459)|
| 0:57:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3461)|
| 0:57:42| And so now, after 2002, every year that a sector plan was reviewed, at that time, it was adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3462)|
| 0:57:47| Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3467)|
| 0:57:49| I believe that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3469)|
| 0:57:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3470)|
| 0:57:51| So this sector plan that concerns this property, has that been adopted, or is that just mere advisory status right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3471)|
| 0:57:58| All the sector plans have been adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3478)|
| 0:58:00| In fact, I believe when the growth policy plan was approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3480)|
| 0:58:04| and the agreement between the city and county and Farragut was adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3484)|
| 0:58:08| all of the sector plans were adopted in total at that time as a starting point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3488)|
| 0:58:13| and then they're all periodically updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3493)|
| 0:58:16| And how much of a legal document is it then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3496)|
| 0:58:21| That's a very good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3501)|
| 0:58:24| I don't know that they're adopted by ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3504)|
| 0:58:26| I could be corrected by the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3506)|
| 0:58:33| I don't know what kind of look he's giving me, but the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3513)|
| 0:58:36| That's all that I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3516)|
| 0:58:37| Law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3517)|
| 0:58:40| Did you ask the law director a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3520)|
| 0:58:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3524)|
| 0:58:45| John, help me out on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3525)|
| 0:58:46| I know zonings are zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3526)|
| 0:58:48| That's a legislative legal act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3528)|
| 0:58:52| Let me look and see if we've adopted that by ordinance or by resolution, and that will tell us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3532)|
| 0:58:59| I want to say that we adopted them by ordinance, but let me make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3539)|
| 0:59:06| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3546)|
| 0:59:09| I just have a quick question for the engineer for Butler Homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3549)|
| 0:59:13| I understand that, you know, that there's not much percolation going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3553)|
| 0:59:17| but what is the increase in volume of water that's going into that creek as a result of this proposed development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3557)|
| 0:59:26| As a result of this development, there won't be any increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3566)|
| 0:59:28| That's the purpose for the regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3568)|
| 0:59:30| Well, no, I know that you're saying that there's not much, but with grass and dirt, there is, you know, some percolation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3570)|
| 0:59:39| There is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3579)|
| 0:59:40| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3580)|
| 0:59:41| I thought you were talking rate, but you're talking volume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3581)|
| 0:59:44| I'm talking volume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3584)|
| 0:59:45| The increase in volume of water going into that creek as a result of this proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3585)|
| 0:59:49| My apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3589)|
| 0:59:50| Yes, the volume does increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3590)|
| 0:59:51| The volume could double.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3591)|
| 0:59:53| Sorry, I wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3593)|
| 0:59:55| So is that your answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3595)|
| 0:59:56| It could double or it will double?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3596)|
| 0:59:58| It will double, but the purpose for stormwater management is that it gets released at a rate lower than the pre-development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3598)|
| 1:00:07| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3607)|
| 1:00:09| Yes, I've got a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3609)|
| 1:00:12| I mean, this water is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3612)|
| 1:00:14| The water in the ditch already exists there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3614)|
| 1:00:19| It looks to me like, and you can correct me if I'm wrong because I'm not an engineer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3619)|
| 1:00:24| it looks to me like what the problem with this ditch is not new developments like Mr. Butler's development that is in compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3624)|
| 1:00:31| with our new much stricter stormwater ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3631)|
| 1:00:35| It sounds like what the problem is is that folks in the past, following the law that we had in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3635)|
| 1:00:43| did not manage stormwater as well as Mr. Butler intends to and as well as current codes requires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3643)|
| 1:00:52| I just don't see why we should hold it against a current developer following current, much more stricter standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3652)|
| 1:01:04| Why we should penalize them for the mistakes, honestly, of this body in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3664)|
| 1:01:10| In the past, we did not have as strong a stormwater ordinance, and this body is responsible as the developers along Gleason Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3670)|
| 1:01:20| They're responsible for the problem that exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3680)|
| 1:01:23| It's not the new guy moving in that's following our more strict standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3683)|
| 1:01:28| It's the ones that have already built out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3688)|
| 1:01:31| In fact, I would challenge that the subdivision in question probably is not built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3691)|
| 1:01:36| the subdivision that these fine folks live in, is not built to current stormwater standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3696)|
| 1:01:42| So I would say if there's a problem, it's the existing subdivisions and not the new subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3702)|
| 1:01:49| because this body and their wisdom have addressed these stormwater issues with a much stronger stormwater ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3709)|
| 1:01:56| And that's why I'm in favor of this proposal because it is a modern development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3716)|
| 1:02:03| You know, talk about the environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3723)|
| 1:02:08| In this day and age, with the world's current population, we all can't live on a 20-acre farm anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3728)|
| 1:02:15| There's too many of us on this planet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3735)|
| 1:02:18| So the answer is that we have higher density development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3738)|
| 1:02:23| If we have higher density development in metropolitan areas like Knox County, then what that's going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3743)|
| 1:02:31| that means we're going to have some farmland available out in the rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3751)|
| 1:02:38| I think that higher density development in some places, and this certainly seems to be a place that's well suited for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3758)|
| 1:02:46| In fact, there's several higher density developments up and down Gleason Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3766)|
| 1:02:51| I drove up and down through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3771)|
| 1:02:53| And that seemed to be what is going into that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3773)|
| 1:02:58| We're talking about putting a round peg in a round hole, addressing things like stormwater with our new titer ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3778)|
| 1:03:06| And I just don't see how we can deny this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3786)|
| 1:03:10| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3790)|
| 1:03:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3791)|
| 1:03:12| I believe each side still has three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3792)|
| 1:03:15| Yes, they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3795)|
| 1:03:16| I'd like to go ahead and move on to that so we can get past this, at least this part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3796)|
| 1:03:21| and then we can continue on with the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3801)|
| 1:03:24| Mr. Irwin, you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3804)|
| 1:03:25| If you want to divide your time up with it, you can take all three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3805)|
| 1:03:32| Thanks, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3812)|
| 1:03:33| In summary of what you just heard from Mr. King, he's asking you to consider a development change in the ruling of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3813)|
| 1:03:39| EMPC in the Knox County Master Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3819)|
| 1:03:43| We are offering a resolution of twice the density at three units per acre than what our current neighborhood is of less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3823)|
| 1:03:49| than one-and-a-half units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3829)|
| 1:03:51| Does that not show that we are trying to be more than fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3831)|
| 1:03:55| A couple of the issues, the riprap that they referred to, it's been tried in that ditch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3835)|
| 1:03:59| It washed away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3839)|
| 1:04:01| We have reports from Ogden that states it would cost $3.2 million to put a riprap in that area of ditch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3841)|
| 1:04:09| And it would also cause all of the trees and the barriers to be removed in putting this in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3849)|
| 1:04:16| You talked about the slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3856)|
| 1:04:17| Anderson Ridge is not sloped nearly as severe as this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3857)|
| 1:04:24| Once again, the properties that they mentioned, the Anderson Ridge, the Lennox, all the developments in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3864)|
| 1:04:31| once again have been in direct conflict with the and were appealed against the Southwest County Sector Main Master Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3871)|
| 1:04:40| You talked about the visual break and the compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3880)|
| 1:04:43| Ladies and gentlemen, it was one unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3883)|
| 1:04:46| That was the entire break and the entire compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3886)|
| 1:04:50| The Leland Cypress that they referred to, we discussed the 80 feet of property that it would be built up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3890)|
| 1:04:58| It will take a long time for a 10-foot tree to get anywhere close to providing a barrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3898)|
| 1:05:04| Mr. McKenzie, you asked about a water statistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3904)|
| 1:05:07| On 10 acres of concrete, one inch of rain produces 211,542 gallons of water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3907)|
| 1:05:17| And to answer your question, will more water come off that hill with concrete?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3917)|
| 1:05:21| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3921)|
| 1:05:22| Beyond a shadow of a doubt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3922)|
| 1:05:24| We're obviously on opposite sides with drainage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3924)|
| 1:05:27| I may refer to Commissioner Daniels, who's in the construction, building, developing business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3927)|
| 1:05:33| to talk about these drainage ditches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3933)|
| 1:05:35| It is our opinion that they don't work properly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3935)|
| 1:05:38| that it is still going to put a large amount of water into this problematic drainage ditch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3938)|
| 1:05:45| Mr. Daniels, I'll ask you to do that when I finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3945)|
| 1:05:49| Let me also question concerning the master plan once again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3949)|
| 1:05:54| Are we going to continue to ignore this master plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3954)|
| 1:05:58| Just because some have been made in appeals in the past gives us no right to keep making them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3958)|
| 1:06:05| We keep breaking the rules against wishes of a well-thought-out plan over 30 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3965)|
| 1:06:12| Are we going to keep compromising it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3972)|
| 1:06:16| Well, thank you, and I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3976)|
| 1:06:18| With three units, the reason we asked for three units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3978)|
| 1:06:22| it will safeguard us from having this type of lower quality development that Mr. Butler indicated he would build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3982)|
| 1:06:28| at five units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3988)|
| 1:06:30| It will allow for Mr. Butler or even another developer to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3990)|
| 1:06:34| and build a quality product that we can be proud of as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3994)|
| 1:06:38| It will ensure our residents that there will be quality built instead of quantity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=3998)|
| 1:06:44| Three units are fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4004)|
| 1:06:46| It protects landowners' rights and still gives them an opportunity to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4006)|
| 1:06:52| It creates less burden of traffic in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4012)|
| 1:06:55| It promotes the development with appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4015)|
| 1:06:59| and it reduces the amount of water that would flow through this drainage ditch of having a more permeable area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4019)|
| 1:07:05| Now, in closing, I'd like to take a quote from Mr. Scott Moore, WBIR's website, and he stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4025)|
| 1:07:12| I believe all of us try and do what's right in our hearts, what our constituents want us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4032)|
| 1:07:20| Thank you, Mr. Moore, for my close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4040)|
| 1:07:22| This is a powerful statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4042)|
| 1:07:23| We ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4043)|
| 1:07:26| We believe that all of you as commissioners will try in your hearts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4046)|
| 1:07:32| and to do what your constituents, these group of people that stood up with me a moment ago, ask you to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4052)|
| 1:07:40| We trust and believe in you that you will apply that philosophy today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4060)|
| 1:07:43| We have faith in the system and confidence in each of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4063)|
| 1:07:46| Thank you for listening to our concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4066)|
| 1:07:48| We are confident that this outcome today, with 19 people doing the right thing for the right reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4068)|
| 1:07:54| we can live with the outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4074)|
| 1:07:56| Thank you very much, and God bless us all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4076)|
| 1:07:59| Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4079)|
| 1:08:08| Mr. King, I'm going to give you four minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4088)|
| 1:08:12| And I hope that the folks out there will not heckle him like you guys have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4092)|
| 1:08:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4097)|
| 1:08:20| Commenting about a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4100)|
| 1:08:23| I think Mr. Irwin would like you to, on the basis of his comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4103)|
| 1:08:27| suggest that he would like you to believe that there was some threat made by Mr. Butler about building lesser quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4107)|
| 1:08:36| In answer to the question, I think he answered truthfully and accurately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4116)|
| 1:08:40| If you have five dwelling units or less, three dwelling units, can you build on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4120)|
| 1:08:48| Answer, yes, but it won't be the same quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4128)|
| 1:08:51| It will not have the same amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4131)|
| 1:08:53| It will not have the same type of materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4133)|
| 1:08:56| That's what the fact of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4136)|
| 1:09:00| At something less than we are requesting, anything less than that six units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4140)|
| 1:09:08| he will have to make a decision whether he wants to build at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4148)|
| 1:09:13| or if he does build, what he can do within the economic constraints placed on it by that density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4153)|
| 1:09:22| That's the reason I asked him when I became involved to figure what the sharpest pencil he had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4162)|
| 1:09:27| to do the quality product that he was telling people he wanted to build there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4167)|
| 1:09:31| And in the price range he wanted to build it, using all brick construction, the streets, the streetlights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4171)|
| 1:09:37| the sidewalks, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4177)|
| 1:09:39| What can you get by with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4179)|
| 1:09:41| And that was the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4181)|
| 1:09:42| Six ultimate final answers, six dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4182)|
| 1:09:49| In response to Commissioner McKenzie's question and point and, you know, followed up on by some of the others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4189)|
| 1:09:58| will there be a higher volume of water coming off the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4198)|
| 1:10:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4202)|
| 1:10:03| How does that affect the ditch in question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4203)|
| 1:10:06| It doesn't because it is detained and released at the same rate into that ditch as preexisted this construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4206)|
| 1:10:15| That's what your regs say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4215)|
| 1:10:18| And, in fact, you have plans now for 100-year current rains, which we didn't even used to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4218)|
| 1:10:26| You know, that's the kind of thing that comes at the next stage of the proceedings after this is rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4226)|
| 1:10:31| is all of that quantitative data and the analysis of it to make sure that the development is done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4231)|
| 1:10:38| so that it meets all those standards and doesn't produce any additional problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4238)|
| 1:10:43| Can we cure what may be a problem there already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4243)|
| 1:10:47| I don't know that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4247)|
| 1:10:48| Can we improve it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4248)|
| 1:10:49| We probably will to some degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4249)|
| 1:10:51| The photographs you have, the engineers talk to me about where those photographs are made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4251)|
| 1:10:56| or at least some of them that reflect the most volume of water is after this ditch has already joined another watercourse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4256)|
| 1:11:03| I don't want to get into all of that because I think it's better left to the people with the technical expertise to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4263)|
| 1:11:11| The one other question I believe Commissioner Davis asked about it was the grade on this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4271)|
| 1:11:17| as it related to the road, which will be a private road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4277)|
| 1:11:20| I can tell you that, according to the plans we submitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4280)|
| 1:11:23| there is one area of our roadway within this development that would exceed the permitted grade just as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4283)|
| 1:11:31| And with some cut and fill, we will not be exceeding the grades that are, in essence, county standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4291)|
| 1:11:40| I've been told that can be accomplished, so I don't see that as a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4300)|
| 1:11:44| I want to make one other point just in case there was some misunderstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4304)|
| 1:11:48| There was a lady who was up here who was talking about having lost the trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4308)|
| 1:11:51| and the water problems she has in her backyard and the fact that she owns on the other side of the ditch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4311)|
| 1:11:56| I had said the ditch was totally within our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4316)|
| 1:12:01| That is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4321)|
| 1:12:03| The ditch where our property is is totally on our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4323)|
| 1:12:06| I believe she backs up to Anderson Ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4326)|
| 1:12:08| and she may have a situation where her boundary line actually goes on the other side of the ditch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4328)|
| 1:12:13| I didn't want you to think I was misstating what my situation was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4333)|
| 1:12:19| I do thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4339)|
| 1:12:22| Again, as it seems like is frequently the case, we have people who have differing views and differing interests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4342)|
| 1:12:32| Your constituency is a large constituency and, ultimately, it's the entirety of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4352)|
| 1:12:39| We believe that our request is reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4359)|
| 1:12:41| We believe our request is in accord with the surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4361)|
| 1:12:46| We believe that adequate provision has been made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4366)|
| 1:12:49| and will be made as to the technical aspects of the development itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4369)|
| 1:12:55| We're, as I say, across the road from a unit or development that was built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4375)|
| 1:13:00| It's one to eight dwelling units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4380)|
| 1:13:02| Next door to us is one to six and a half dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4382)|
| 1:13:06| There's nothing, if you will, exceptional or out of the ordinary about this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4386)|
| 1:13:11| I would ask that you support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4391)|
| 1:13:14| That's the reason there is a provision for amending sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4394)|
| 1:13:19| It's just for this campaign to provide or permit the opportunity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4399)|
| 1:13:28| And so we would ask that you vote in favor of amending the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4408)|
| 1:13:33| and rezoning it plan residential up to six units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4413)|
| 1:13:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4417)|
| 1:13:40| Fifth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4420)|
| 1:13:43| I'd like to make a motion that we approve with a density of four units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4423)|
| 1:13:48| I'd like to second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4428)|
| 1:13:51| I make a substitute motion that we approve at five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4431)|
| 1:13:59| I have a second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4439)|
| 1:14:01| Is that a per MPC recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4441)|
| 1:14:02| Per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4442)|
| 1:14:05| I'll second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4445)|
| 1:14:08| Mr. Chair, I don't want to tell you how to do things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4448)|
| 1:14:11| but you may want to go ahead and deal with the sector plan issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4451)|
| 1:14:16| whether or not to affirm MPC's recommendation to deny medium density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4456)|
| 1:14:22| Then that will lead into the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4462)|
| 1:14:30| Fifth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4470)|
| 1:14:32| I've got a substitute motion, so that's where we're at right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4472)|
| 1:14:37| That's where we're at right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4477)|
| 1:14:38| So I guess we need to go ahead with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4478)|
| 1:14:41| We have a substitute motion, five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4481)|
| 1:14:45| Mr. Chairman, I'm a bit confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4485)|
| 1:14:47| So is the substitute motion of five units per acre for 12P07| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4487)|
| 1:14:51| and we're just sort of skipping 12E07 or coming back to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4491)|
| 1:14:55| We're going 12E07SP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4495)|
| 1:14:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4499)|
| 1:15:01| I mean, unless Mr. Lambert wants to go ahead and make part of his motion the rest of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4501)|
| 1:15:09| That's Mr. Keene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4509)|
| 1:15:13| Can you all live with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4513)|
| 1:15:15| What you have before you are two separate items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4515)|
| 1:15:19| One is a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4519)|
| 1:15:21| In order to consider a density at more than five units to the acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4521)|
| 1:15:27| you would have to amend the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4527)|
| 1:15:31| If you do --if there is no motion to amend the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4531)|
| 1:15:38| or a motion to leave the sector plan like it is, if there's no motion to amend it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4538)|
| 1:15:41| then the most units per acre you would be able to consider would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4541)|
| 1:15:47| if it stays like it is, would be five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4547)|
| 1:15:51| I don't --I'm not a parliamentarian and I'm not going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4551)|
| 1:15:54| I got it, Mr. Keene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4554)|
| 1:15:55| I think that the chair rules that we do have to do the sector plan first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4555)|
| 1:16:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4560)|
| 1:16:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4562)|
| 1:16:03| So we need a motion, fifth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4563)|
| 1:16:05| I'd like a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4565)|
| 1:16:06| We on the sector plan that we keep it at low density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4566)|
| 1:16:16| So I guess he's asking for more, but I believe what MPC only approved up to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4576)|
| 1:16:24| So I want to uphold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4584)|
| 1:16:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4585)|
| 1:16:26| MPC approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4586)|
| 1:16:27| Well, they denied his request for medium density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4587)|
| 1:16:30| And at MPC, the plan stays, stayed at low density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4590)|
| 1:16:37| So the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4597)|
| 1:16:38| If we don't do anything, it's already where it needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4598)|
| 1:16:41| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4601)|
| 1:16:42| He's still appealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4602)|
| 1:16:44| You still need to act on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4604)|
| 1:16:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4606)|
| 1:16:47| So this is really an appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4607)|
| 1:16:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4608)|
| 1:16:49| No, it's not an appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4609)|
| 1:16:50| On the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4610)|
| 1:16:51| Well, in reality, that's what you're ending up doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4611)|
| 1:16:55| But since we had an affirmative vote on a rezoning, we don't do the appeal like we used to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4615)|
| 1:17:02| If we had, if both of them were denied, then it would be a full-fledged appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4622)|
| 1:17:06| I guess what I was saying is you may want to, in order to clean up how you can consider the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4626)|
| 1:17:12| either affirm MPC's recommendation to deny MDR or approve MDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4632)|
| 1:17:18| Then I make a motion we uphold MPC's recommendation to deny medium density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4638)|
| 1:17:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4645)|
| 1:17:30| The motion is to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4650)|
| 1:17:32| Deny the medium density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4652)|
| 1:17:33| Deny medium density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4653)|
| 1:17:37| Which is what MPC recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4657)|
| 1:17:39| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4659)|

| 1:17:47| It's been denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4667)|
| 1:17:50| I guess we go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4670)|
| 1:17:51| Commissioner Hammond had a motion of four units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4671)|
| 1:17:55| And then Commissioner Lambert put a substitute motion of five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4675)|
| 1:18:04| We need to start that all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4684)|
| 1:18:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4686)|

| 1:20:57| Five-fourteen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4857)|
| 1:21:00| This one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4860)|
| 1:21:06| The count is five ayes, 14 noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4866)|
| 1:21:10| Now we can go back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4870)|
| 1:21:12| I have a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4872)|
| 1:21:16| Four point nine units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4876)|
| 1:21:19| Folks, can I get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4879)|
| 1:21:23| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4883)|
| 1:21:27| Probably moved and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4887)|
| 1:21:30| I'd like to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4890)|
| 1:21:32| People's jobs are at risk here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4892)|
| 1:21:35| When you're talking, this is about a two-and-a-half, three-year project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4895)|
| 1:21:40| There are probably going to be 200 families that their jobs will depend on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4900)|
| 1:21:46| We're talking, when you're talking the mortgage brokers, when you're talking the realtors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4906)|
| 1:21:52| when you're talking the folks that hang the drywall, the guys that frame the houses, the people who paint the houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4912)|
| 1:21:58| the people who lay the brick, there's about 200 families that will be affected by this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4918)|
| 1:22:04| Now, as far as the water issues and all of the various issues these fine folks have brought up, they are not issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4924)|
| 1:22:12| Knox County has a stormwater ordinance that deals with stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4932)|
| 1:22:16| We have already dealt with that issue when we passed a stricter stormwater ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4936)|
| 1:22:22| The only issue here is whether these condominiums are compatible with the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4942)|
| 1:22:30| And I've driven up and down this area, and everywhere you look, all you see are condos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4950)|
| 1:22:36| They're not trying to put a square peg in a round hole here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4956)|
| 1:22:40| All they're trying to do is build a development that is consistent with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4960)|
| 1:22:47| And people's jobs depend on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4967)|
| 1:22:49| Now, not everybody's like us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4969)|
| 1:22:51| Not everybody has a second income with a government job coming to the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4971)|
| 1:22:56| A lot of folks are struggling out there, and things are getting rough for them, especially the carpenters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4976)|
| 1:23:02| and the people in this building industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4982)|
| 1:23:05| And you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4985)|
| 1:23:07| I'm kind of awkward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4987)|
| 1:23:09| I'm dyslexic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4989)|
| 1:23:10| I see backwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4990)|
| 1:23:11| I can't nail two boards together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4991)|
| 1:23:13| But I tell you what I'll do every month is I will fight for those that do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4993)|
| 1:23:18| And we have got an industry out there that is struggling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=4998)|
| 1:23:21| The whole economy is starting on the national level is starting to go downhill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5001)|
| 1:23:27| Knox County can prosper during these difficult times if we can continue to build good condominiums that retirees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5007)|
| 1:23:36| can move into, their low tax rate, their low cost of living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5016)|
| 1:23:41| We can draw people in as they retire from the northeast into this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5021)|
| 1:23:46| but they're going to have to have some place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5026)|
| 1:23:49| And I think that this project would be a great place to welcome our new neighbors to as they move down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5029)|
| 1:23:57| running from the northern cities where the cost of living is so much higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5037)|
| 1:24:02| So I'm pleading with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5042)|
| 1:24:04| And you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5044)|
| 1:24:05| I think everybody knows that the butlers are friends of mine, and I'm not a bit worried about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5045)|
| 1:24:09| They're intelligent, resourceful people, and they're going to find a way to make it in this world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5049)|
| 1:24:14| I'm worried about their subcontractors, the ones calling every day begging for work, the ones borrowing money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5054)|
| 1:24:20| so they can feed their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5060)|
| 1:24:23| And, frankly, I think we've got to stay poised and ready for growth to continue to provide jobs for these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5063)|
| 1:24:32| So I plead with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5072)|
| 1:24:34| Vote with me on this, 4.9 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5074)|
| 1:24:38| We have a substitute motion on the floor, 4.9 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5078)|

| 1:25:10| Aye votes, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5110)|
| 1:25:12| Vote four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5112)|
| 1:25:18| We have the original motion on the floor, four units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5118)|

| 1:25:44| Can I have a personal privilege real quick for the Boy Scouts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5144)|

| 1:25:49| They've got to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5149)|
| 1:25:52| Do we have any objections to a personal privilege to recognize the Boy Scouts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5152)|
| 1:25:57| Seeing none, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5157)|

| 1:33:18| Commissioner Strickland, I've had a lot of calls on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5598)|
| 1:33:20| We have a lot of sinkholes on that property there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5600)|
| 1:33:23| How is this going to be addressed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5603)|
| 1:33:29| It will be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5609)|
| 1:33:30| We'll take a look at that at the site plan stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5610)|
| 1:33:34| That will be the next part of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5614)|
| 1:33:37| That's where we'll look at the sinkholes as well as the slope areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5617)|
| 1:33:40| You know, no more rain than we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5620)|
| 1:33:42| I've had people down there, this creek down there, this water is going through this sinkhole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5622)|
| 1:33:46| and the muddy water is coming up in the creek down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5626)|
| 1:33:49| With the opposition that I've had calling me, most of the people up in that area are elderly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5629)|
| 1:33:54| I'm going to make a motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5634)|
| 1:33:59| I believe the people up there didn't fight this the first time it came up, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5639)|
| 1:34:06| But then the applicant has come back and asked for more after they went along with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5646)|
| 1:34:10| So that's another reason I'm making a motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5650)|
| 1:34:15| Can I get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5655)|
| 1:34:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5658)|
| 1:34:20| Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5660)|
| 1:34:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5661)|
| 1:34:22| I notice this is a large track of land, 119 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5662)|
| 1:34:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5665)|
| 1:34:26| What do you plan to do with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5666)|
| 1:34:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5667)|
| 1:34:28| I'm David Harbin at 4334 Paper Mill Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5668)|
| 1:34:31| Basically, this project is under construction right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5671)|
| 1:34:36| We initially got one unit an acre out there and we're putting in drain fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5676)|
| 1:34:42| We then went to the health department and contacted them about installing our drain fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5682)|
| 1:34:48| And it was basically their idea that we put back before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5688)|
| 1:34:52| They said that this is one of the largest subdivisions that's gone into Knox County on drain fields in a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5692)|
| 1:34:59| They asked us, is there any way that we can take a look at this to bring sewer to the area and put it on sewer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5699)|
| 1:35:05| And everyone over there said, no matter how much careful I am in laying out the drain fields, how restrictive I am,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5705)|
| 1:35:12| I can guarantee you within 10 years, 10 to 15 percent of them will have sewer problems out there at that thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5712)|
| 1:35:19| Please check and see if you can get sewer to the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5719)|
| 1:35:22| Well, we've checked with Knox Chapman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5722)|
| 1:35:25| It's going to take quite an investment for us to get sewer to the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5725)|
| 1:35:29| We have to build force mains, pump stations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5729)|
| 1:35:32| However, they do have the facilities there that we could pump into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5732)|
| 1:35:37| So I guess that's why we're here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5737)|
| 1:35:39| We were prepared to go with drain fields the way it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5739)|
| 1:35:43| As for an economic benefit, there's really not that much from what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5743)|
| 1:35:48| For the added density, we'll be able to put in the sanitary sewer with the pump station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5748)|
| 1:35:54| So that's why we're back here today is to help the health department out and future residents out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5754)|
| 1:36:00| to move away from the drain fields and to put in the sanitary sewer system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5760)|
| 1:36:06| But we do need some help in getting the additional density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5766)|
| 1:36:09| and help to defray the cost to get the sewer out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5769)|
| 1:36:12| So by doing it right here to your right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5772)|
| 1:36:16| Okay. There you are. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5776)|
| 1:36:17| So by doing two units per acre, then this allows sewers to come there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5777)|
| 1:36:22| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5782)|
| 1:36:23| We're not going to build any more roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5783)|
| 1:36:26| We're not grading any more of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5786)|
| 1:36:28| We're able just to be half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5788)|
| 1:36:30| The lot's half as big, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5790)|
| 1:36:31| But we have sewer there and there'll be no drain fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5791)|
| 1:36:34| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5794)|
| 1:36:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5795)|
| 1:36:36| Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5796)|
| 1:36:37| I notice in our packet that more than 46 percent of this site is 25 percent slope or greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5797)|
| 1:36:45| And I think this just goes to the heart of the problem about our developments creeping up our ridge lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5805)|
| 1:36:50| And I don't see how you resolve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5810)|
| 1:36:52| It's nice that you're getting sewers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5812)|
| 1:36:54| But, I mean, this is a bigger problem that goes unresolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5814)|
| 1:36:57| Well, we're not developing on the ridge lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5817)|
| 1:36:59| Those will be the back lots of the lots, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5819)|
| 1:37:02| We're down at the bottom of the ridge line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5822)|
| 1:37:04| And that'll just be the backyards of the people back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5824)|
| 1:37:10| Even another 20 percent, actually, 21 percent is 15 to 25 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5830)|
| 1:37:15| So you're going to have to go up some slope here on this thing just to fit some properties in here, aren't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5835)|
| 1:37:20| The vast majority of that, Commissioner Harmon, is on the flatter area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5840)|
| 1:37:24| We'll go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5844)|
| 1:37:25| There's one area that will go across the ridge line, not really the ridge line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5845)|
| 1:37:29| at the bottom of the ridge, and then it flattens out again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5849)|
| 1:37:32| So very minimal disturbance to the steep slopes in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5852)|
| 1:37:40| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5860)|
| 1:37:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5861)|
| 1:37:43| Mr. Johnson, I see conflicting information from the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5863)|
| 1:37:48| or from recommendations between the documents that we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5868)|
| 1:37:53| Can you explain that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5873)|
| 1:37:55| Like in the summary statement we've got approve LDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5875)|
| 1:38:01| and then in the blue pages I've got staff recommendation deny LDR and SLPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5881)|
| 1:38:09| So I'm just kind of conflicted on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5889)|
| 1:38:10| Can you explain what's going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5890)|
| 1:38:12| The Planning Commission approved LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5892)|
| 1:38:17| The staff recommend denial of LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5897)|
| 1:38:21| The Planning Commission approved the LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5901)|
| 1:38:23| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5903)|
| 1:38:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5904)|
| 1:38:27| And I wouldn't mind for a postponement if I can meet with Mr. Pinkston during the next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5907)|
| 1:38:32| and meet with my developers and see if there's any common ground that we can meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5912)|
| 1:38:36| That would be fine with my developers, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5916)|
| 1:38:39| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5919)|
| 1:38:40| I can defer that then, but I think you also need to meet with the other commissioner in the ninth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5920)|
| 1:38:46| Okay, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5926)|
| 1:38:49| But not at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5929)|
| 1:38:51| Maybe I can meet at the same time if you function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5931)|
| 1:38:55| No, we can meet at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5935)|

| 1:39:10| We changed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5950)|
| 1:39:11| You changed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5951)|

| 1:39:17| I second it and I will second the deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5957)|
| 1:39:20| We have a motion to defer it to the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5960)|
| 1:39:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5964)|
| 1:39:25| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5965)|
| 1:39:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5967)|
| 1:39:28| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5968)|
| 1:39:29| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5969)|
| 1:39:30| We're going to defer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5970)|
| 1:39:32| The next two requests, 1-C-08-SP and 1-V-08-RZ are requests of TTC Halls LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5972)|
| 1:39:43| The first is for a North County Sector Plan Amendment from LDR Low Density Residential to C Commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5983)|
| 1:39:49| The second is for rezoning from A Agricultural to SP Shopping Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5989)|
| 1:39:53| The property is located on the northeast side of North Freeway, southeast of Whitworth Drive in the 7th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=5993)|
| 1:40:01| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6001)|
| 1:40:04| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6004)|
| 1:40:10| You're in opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6010)|
| 1:40:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6013)|
| 1:40:15| MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6015)|
| 1:40:18| This is a request for a shopping center zoning and a commercial plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6018)|
| 1:40:22| The property is located on Norris Freeway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6022)|
| 1:40:26| It is adjacent to a major commercial development that is under development right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6026)|
| 1:40:31| I believe we've got a photograph, a copy of a photograph in your packet that shows that pretty much in the middle of the photograph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6031)|
| 1:40:39| This is just a very small piece of commercial property that I believe is going to be added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6039)|
| 1:40:46| and incorporated into that overall development scheme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6046)|
| 1:40:50| It's about 1.7 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6050)|
| 1:40:53| In looking at the request and the adjacent zoning and planning, both the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6053)|
| 1:41:01| and the Planning Commission recommend the staff recommend approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6061)|
| 1:41:05| The Planning Commission concurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6065)|
| 1:41:07| I believe it was a 12-2 vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6067)|
| 1:41:13| Located on Norris Freeway and felt like it was a sound request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6073)|
| 1:41:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6082)|
| 1:41:23| Who would like to go first, the opposition or the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6083)|
| 1:41:31| You going first, Mr. King?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6091)|
| 1:41:33| He probably wants to go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6093)|
| 1:42:04| Name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6124)|
| 1:42:06| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6126)|
| 1:42:07| My name is Bud Cullum, 6312 Kingston Pike, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6127)|
| 1:42:15| Several of you are familiar with this project, all of the new ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6135)|
| 1:42:18| To briefly recap, we're in the process of developing a Wal-Mart Home Depot anchored shopping center at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6138)|
| 1:42:28| This property was rezoned to shopping center zone in November of 2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6148)|
| 1:42:35| Last year, a gentleman that owned a house that we had talked to over the years about possibly purchasing came to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6155)|
| 1:42:43| decided that he would like to sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6163)|
| 1:42:46| And long story short, we came to terms with him and agreed to buy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6166)|
| 1:42:52| It kind of squares up an area, as you can see on the handout that I showed you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6172)|
| 1:42:58| shows not only a site plan but also an aerial photo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6178)|
| 1:43:03| What we would like to do is to bring that into the shopping center zone with the rest of our shopping center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6183)|
| 1:43:11| And as some of you may be aware, when our site plan was approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6191)|
| 1:43:17| before we could begin site work on this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6197)|
| 1:43:20| the Metropolitan Planning Commission put down a number of restrictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6200)|
| 1:43:24| and then we are in the process also of adding some restrictions that will be in the form of covenants that will run with the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6204)|
| 1:43:33| And we're proposing to effectively roll this parcel into the rest of the shopping center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6213)|
| 1:43:41| As you can see on the aerial photo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6221)|
| 1:43:45| there's a ridge line that runs right down the property line with a row of large pine trees that will effectively serve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6225)|
| 1:43:54| we feel like, as the logical buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6234)|
| 1:43:57| So our request is that you let us include this into the shopping center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6237)|
| 1:44:04| The property has already been graded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6244)|
| 1:44:08| Actually, the State Department of Transportation has said that the only way without a house on this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6248)|
| 1:44:16| that it will ever have access would be across our property that's already zoned shopping center in our entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6256)|
| 1:44:22| because it was a non-conforming driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6262)|
| 1:44:27| And apparently once the residential use no longer exists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6267)|
| 1:44:33| then this property would have severe difficulties in obtaining a curb cut directly onto Norris Freeway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6273)|
| 1:44:42| With that, if I have any time left, I'd like to save it for any rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6282)|
| 1:44:47| Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6287)|
| 1:44:55| Mr. Chairman, I'm John King, P.O. Box 2425, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6295)|
| 1:45:01| I don't know whether you're going to need any of your rebuttal time or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6301)|
| 1:45:04| In the interest of time, I'm going to keep this short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6304)|
| 1:45:07| When the property was rezoned to shopping center, there was opposition to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6307)|
| 1:45:12| They didn't prevail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6312)|
| 1:45:14| When the shopping center proposal that is now under development was proposed, there was opposition to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6314)|
| 1:45:22| They didn't prevail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6322)|
| 1:45:24| We now see what I spent a considerable amount of time talking about at MPC on this issue as sort of the start of the domino effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6324)|
| 1:45:38| If you look at the plans and proposals out there, I forget right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6338)|
| 1:45:42| I didn't recheck my figures, but I forget how many hundred thousand square feet of shopping center there is already at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6342)|
| 1:45:53| When I spoke at MPC, I simply asked, let's keep this zone like it is so we have some visual break across the frontage of Norris Freeway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6353)|
| 1:46:04| You have a huge, huge development going there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6364)|
| 1:46:07| Lifestyle in that area is already undergoing change, and now we have the start, as I say, of sort of a domino effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6367)|
| 1:46:15| There are other properties in this same general area that it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6375)|
| 1:46:20| You're going to be seeing more of the same sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6380)|
| 1:46:25| And I had a client who was a property owner in the area who first became involved when the proposed shopping center that's underway now was before MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6385)|
| 1:46:39| And that's the reason for my being here now once again in opposition, essentially saying on this particular area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6399)|
| 1:46:49| on this piece of ground that much, enough is enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6409)|
| 1:46:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6413)|
| 1:46:58| You have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6418)|
| 1:46:59| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6419)|
| 1:47:03| I think if you look at the, not only the site plan, but especially the aerial photograph,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6423)|
| 1:47:11| and you see where the neighborhood is, you see where this ridge line with the existing mature trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6431)|
| 1:47:18| I think it becomes obvious where the natural break between retail, commercial, shopping center, and residential development is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6438)|
| 1:47:27| And I think that break line is right where we're showing that it would be stopping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6447)|
| 1:47:37| I want to point out, I think I've probably pointed it out to some of the commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6457)|
| 1:47:41| but in fairness to at least to the eight new ones, and in deference to Mr. King, Mr. King is a very good acquaintance of mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6461)|
| 1:47:51| but I think it should be pointed out that his client does not live in Knox County full time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6471)|
| 1:47:57| I understand she lives in either Manhattan or in Greenwich, Connecticut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6477)|
| 1:48:03| She does own property in the area, but it's, to my understanding, several miles away from this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6483)|
| 1:48:12| And with that, if there's any questions any commissioners would like to ask, I'd be happy to help answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6492)|
| 1:48:19| Let me get Mr. King first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6499)|
| 1:48:22| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6502)|
| 1:48:23| Three-minute rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6503)|
| 1:48:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6504)|
| 1:48:25| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6505)|
| 1:48:26| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6506)|
| 1:48:28| I'd like to make a motion we approve both items per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6508)|
| 1:48:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6512)|
| 1:48:34| Property moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6514)|
| 1:48:35| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6515)|
| 1:48:36| I have a question here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6516)|
| 1:48:37| Can I assume this is the same Walmart super center for which a TIF is being sought?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6517)|
| 1:48:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6523)|
| 1:48:44| This has nothing to do with the TIF, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6524)|
| 1:48:46| But the location, the presumed location, the planned location and layout, does it assume the granting of the TIF?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6526)|
| 1:48:54| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6534)|
| 1:48:56| The size and scope of the property, does it assume the granting of the TIF?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6536)|
| 1:49:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6540)|
| 1:49:02| I mean, as you see in the picture, you can see in the picture that the size and the scope of the project has begun,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6542)|
| 1:49:10| the site work has begun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6550)|
| 1:49:11| You said during the TIF that process or when you chatted with us about this, you sort of started this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6551)|
| 1:49:17| and now you need the TIF to sort of make the whole thing economically work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6557)|
| 1:49:20| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6560)|
| 1:49:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6561)|
| 1:49:22| That's what I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6562)|
| 1:49:23| So you need a break from us and a zoning change to make this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6563)|
| 1:49:29| All for the purpose of moving a Walmart a few yards across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6569)|
| 1:49:33| I purchased this property after having dealt with this landowner since probably about August of 2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6573)|
| 1:49:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6579)|
| 1:49:40| We purchased this property, and we're asking for it to be zoned shopping center like the rest of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6580)|
| 1:49:45| And what's going to happen to the old Walmart when this one opens up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6585)|
| 1:49:48| I don't own that shopping center, so I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6588)|
| 1:49:51| I think there are –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6591)|
| 1:49:53| An empty shell possibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6593)|
| 1:49:55| I'd say very brief time, very brief time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6595)|
| 1:49:58| Happens to a lot of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6598)|
| 1:49:59| I might be interested in purchasing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6599)|
| 1:50:01| I think it's going to be a great location when we finish our development and we finish all the road work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6601)|
| 1:50:06| I think it will be highly sought after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6606)|
| 1:50:08| Maybe all those persons whose small shops are put out of work can find housing in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6608)|
| 1:50:14| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6614)|
| 1:50:15| Yes, Mr. McClellan, this is for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6615)|
| 1:50:19| This ridge line here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6619)|
| 1:50:22| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6622)|
| 1:50:23| Is that your property or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6623)|
| 1:50:27| The way you've got this drawn off here, I can't tell whether the trees are on you or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6627)|
| 1:50:31| I think they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6631)|
| 1:50:32| Am I correct on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6632)|
| 1:50:34| To be honest, I hate to tell you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6634)|
| 1:50:36| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6636)|
| 1:50:37| I think they're right on the property line, to be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6637)|
| 1:50:39| I would have no problem stating that we would leave that because the way it's graded, it doesn't really show up well on this aerial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6639)|
| 1:50:47| But because of that grade, there's a slope right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6647)|
| 1:50:51| So it really wouldn't do us any good to take those trees down because we wouldn't gain any property anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6651)|
| 1:50:57| Another thing you commented on is on the cut for the driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6657)|
| 1:51:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6660)|
| 1:51:01| That's an illegal cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6661)|
| 1:51:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6662)|
| 1:51:03| It's nonconforming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6663)|
| 1:51:04| I forget how TDOT referred to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6664)|
| 1:51:06| Well, if they don't go along with it, we've got a piece of property there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6666)|
| 1:51:09| then it's going to be landlocked, roughly, that there's no use for it, would they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6669)|
| 1:51:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6673)|
| 1:51:14| My proposal would be the only way into it would be through the shopping center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6674)|
| 1:51:18| The shopping center that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6678)|
| 1:51:19| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6679)|
| 1:51:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6681)|
| 1:51:22| I'm going to go along with the two commissioners in the district then and vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6682)|
| 1:51:26| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6686)|
| 1:51:28| Just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6688)|
| 1:51:29| So you had talked about the natural break, so you have no intention of growing this property anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6689)|
| 1:51:36| This will be the last?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6696)|
| 1:51:38| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6698)|
| 1:51:39| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6699)|
| 1:51:40| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6700)|
| 1:51:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6701)|
| 1:51:44| You said that this piece of property is not part of the TIF properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6704)|
| 1:51:50| It would be part of the TIF property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6710)|
| 1:51:52| It would be part of the TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6712)|
| 1:51:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6713)|
| 1:51:55| And the increase in value of this property would then go to pay off the TIF?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6715)|
| 1:52:00| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6720)|
| 1:52:03| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6723)|
| 1:52:05| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6725)|
| 1:52:07| You know, we're discussing this TIF right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6727)|
| 1:52:09| We haven't approved the TIF here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6729)|
| 1:52:11| All we did was approve to send it to the IDB board to find out whether the impact on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6731)|
| 1:52:17| economic impact, whether it was feasible or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6737)|
| 1:52:19| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6739)|
| 1:52:20| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6740)|
| 1:52:21| I think we're quite a ways away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6741)|
| 1:52:22| Right now, we're a long ways from the TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6742)|
| 1:52:24| It shouldn't even enter this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6744)|
| 1:52:27| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6747)|
| 1:52:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6748)|
| 1:52:29| Mr. Coleman, just catch me up on that little red corner, striped corner there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6749)|
| 1:52:36| Okay, it's graded, which I just didn't follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6756)|
| 1:52:40| There was a house on it, houses were moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6760)|
| 1:52:42| There was a house and some metal outbuildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6762)|
| 1:52:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6765)|
| 1:52:47| Fred and Judy Carnes owned that property, and we had dealt with them on and off since 2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6767)|
| 1:52:52| And Fred had been storing his landscape business equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6772)|
| 1:52:59| and he had two metal buildings that he had erected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6779)|
| 1:53:01| And he decided to scale that back and had found another house that he wanted to buy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6781)|
| 1:53:06| And, again, long story short, we went back and forth, came to terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6786)|
| 1:53:10| and decided to purchase it from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6790)|
| 1:53:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6792)|
| 1:53:13| Now, what's your intent to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6793)|
| 1:53:15| As this goes forward, what are you going to do with it as regards to the development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6795)|
| 1:53:18| Our intent is to roll that into the shopping center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6798)|
| 1:53:22| and have the same restrictions that MPC put on the balance of our property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6802)|
| 1:53:27| and it would become an outlot that we'd either one or two outlots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6807)|
| 1:53:31| If you look at the site plan, it's a little confusing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6811)|
| 1:53:36| because I actually drew to show the property in question that's not zoned yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6816)|
| 1:53:42| where I'm asking for the rezoning in yellow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6822)|
| 1:53:45| But if you see how it ties in with kind of the irregular-shaped lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6825)|
| 1:53:49| and then we're showing a proposal for two out parcels that would front on that entrance road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6829)|
| 1:53:56| And what is it that your opposition wishes to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6836)|
| 1:54:00| What do they propose that it should be other than what you would like to do with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6840)|
| 1:54:06| Well, I may have to let Mr. King,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6846)|
| 1:54:10| but it's my understanding that his client wishes we had left the entire 50 acres as a pasture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6850)|
| 1:54:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6857)|
| 1:54:20| To my knowledge, I have never, she has never called me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6860)|
| 1:54:23| She has, to my knowledge, never come to any of the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6863)|
| 1:54:25| She simply has hired Mr. King to come and oppose me every time I'm up before MPC or the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6865)|
| 1:54:35| We have a motion on the floor to approve both per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6875)|
| 1:54:39| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6879)|
| 1:54:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6881)|
| 1:54:42| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6882)|
| 1:54:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6883)|
| 1:54:44| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6884)|
| 1:54:45| We have one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6885)|
| 1:54:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6888)|
| 1:54:52| On page 19, the zoning appeal, 07-045-0,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6892)|
| 1:54:59| the zoning appeal by Arthur Seymour, Jr., paternity, for SONCO, Inc., of TTCDA approval of condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6899)|
| 1:55:05| to require indirect elimination or backlit lighting for SON.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6905)|
| 1:55:09| The property is located on the northwest side of Hardin Valley Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6909)|
| 1:55:13| southwest of Boykes Road in the 6th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6913)|
| 1:55:18| Commissioner Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6918)|
| 1:55:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6921)|
| 1:55:23| Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6923)|
| 1:55:25| I'd like to excuse myself from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6925)|
| 1:55:27| There could be a conflict of interest with me on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6927)|
| 1:55:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6930)|
| 1:55:32| Is there an applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6932)|
| 1:55:33| Yes, Mr. Chairman, members of the commission, Arthur Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6933)|
| 1:55:36| Hold on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6936)|
| 1:55:37| You're the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6937)|
| 1:55:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6938)|
| 1:55:39| I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6939)|
| 1:55:40| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6940)|
| 1:55:43| I don't want the appeal granted today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6943)|
| 1:55:45| My request is that this matter be referred back to the Tennessee Tech Corridor Development Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6945)|
| 1:55:53| We met last week or the week before with the development corporation about signage standards for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6953)|
| 1:56:01| and we hope to have a Mr. Johnson was present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6961)|
| 1:56:04| He's the executive director of the TTCDA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6964)|
| 1:56:08| We hope to have further discussions that perhaps will eliminate this matter from your agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6968)|
| 1:56:14| But for this meeting, we would request that it be referred back to the Tennessee Tech Corridor Development Authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6974)|
| 1:56:21| for further discussion regarding lighting standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6981)|
| 1:56:27| I make a motion we send this back to the TTCDA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6987)|
| 1:56:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6991)|
| 1:56:33| I've got a motion on the floor to send it back to TTCDA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6993)|
| 1:56:39| Properly second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=6999)|
| 1:56:40| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=7000)|
| 1:56:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=7001)|
| 1:56:42| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=7002)|
| 1:56:43| And I want to abstain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=7003)|
| 1:56:46| We have two abstentions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=7006)|
| 1:56:50| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=7010)|
| 1:57:04| Is Mr. J.D. Roberson in here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=7024)|
| 1:57:09| J.D. Roberson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=7029)|
| 1:57:12| I want to defer it to March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=7032)|
| 1:57:15| Motion to postpone it until next month or defer it until next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=7035)|
| 1:57:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=7039)|
| 1:57:20| Properly moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=7040)|
| 1:57:21| We defer it to March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=7041)|
| 1:57:25| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=7045)|
| 1:57:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=7047)|
| 1:57:28| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=7048)|
| 1:57:32| Actually, by operation of your rules, it will automatically defer to the next month's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=7052)|
| 1:57:40| New concept development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=7060)|
| 1:57:43| New concept development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=7063)|
| 1:57:46| We also defer that to March for our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=7066)|
| 1:57:54| Seeing no other business coming before the zoning, zoning is now adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=7074)|
| 1:58:02| Do we need to take five minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=7082)|
| 1:58:04| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225zoning?start=7084)|
