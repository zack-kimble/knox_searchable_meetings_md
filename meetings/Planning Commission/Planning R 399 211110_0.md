| 0:07:21| I'd like to read a proclamation from one of our former Planning Commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=441)|
| 0:07:25| who passed away last year and was unable to attend the meetings when they were virtual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=445)|
| 0:07:32| So this is a proclamation on behalf of Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=452)|
| 0:07:36| Knoxville-Knox County Planning has a strong history of thoughtful, considerate direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=456)|
| 0:07:41| provided by its volunteer Planning Commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=461)|
| 0:07:45| which was continued by the service of Commissioner Conrad Mack Goodwin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=465)|
| 0:07:50| And whereas during the seven years that Mr. Goodwin has served on the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=470)|
| 0:07:56| he sought to promote smart growth while giving special consideration to the environment and climate change impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=476)|
| 0:08:04| And whereas Mack's dedication to the community and environment was evident through his volunteer efforts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=484)|
| 0:08:11| he was active in Town Hall East, the French Broad Preservation Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=491)|
| 0:08:16| Slow Food Tennessee Valley, and Native Plant Rescue Squad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=496)|
| 0:08:21| And whereas Mack was an archaeologist, an author,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=501)|
| 0:08:25| who gained a unique perspective from living and working in various locations along the U.S. East Coast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=505)|
| 0:08:31| and abroad in the Caribbean and Pacific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=511)|
| 0:08:35| And whereas Mack is remembered as an especially generous individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=515)|
| 0:08:39| which was apparent in the consideration he gave to cases in his personal life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=519)|
| 0:08:44| He and his wife were incredibly hospitable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=524)|
| 0:08:48| establishing their home as the official Slovenian Consulate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=528)|
| 0:08:52| where they welcomed students and others into their home and community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=532)|
| 0:08:56| Whereas Mack was a genuinely thoughtful person who had great respect for the expertise of both staff and community members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=536)|
| 0:09:04| That reflection and consideration will benefit our community for years to come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=544)|
| 0:09:09| and we are grateful for the time spent working alongside him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=549)|
| 0:09:14| Now, therefore, it be resolved that the Knoxville-Knox County Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=554)|
| 0:09:18| and planning staff express their gratitude for Conrad and Mack Goodwin's contributions to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=558)|
| 0:09:25| through good land use planning and dedicated public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=565)|
| 0:09:30| Thank you. We'll provide this to his wife, Lydia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=570)|

| 0:19:45| Ms. Dunlap?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| The applicant did indicate to us that she would not be attending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1187)|
| 0:19:50| This was in an email right before this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| We do have several people signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1192)|
| 0:19:55| Michael Opezee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1195)|
| 0:19:57| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1197)|
| 0:19:59| Opezee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1199)|
| 0:20:01| Opezee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1201)|
| 0:20:02| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1202)|
| 0:20:03| Opezee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1203)|
| 0:20:04| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1204)|
| 0:20:06| Come up to the microphone, please, and give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1206)|
| 0:20:14| I apologize for mispronouncing your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1214)|
| 0:20:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1216)|
| 0:20:17| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1217)|
| 0:20:18| I'm used to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1218)|
| 0:20:20| My name is Michael.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1220)|
| 0:20:21| I'm here with my wife, Kimberly, and my two boys, Augustin and Dante.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1221)|
| 0:20:24| We live at 3610 Buffett Mill, perched immediately above the field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1224)|
| 0:20:30| so we literally bring a unique vantage point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1230)|
| 0:20:33| We oppose, as well, the motion to rezone to RN2 on the logic that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1233)|
| 0:20:39| already stated in the forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1239)|
| 0:20:41| Briefly, that is simply that the infrastructure of the field is not sufficient for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1241)|
| 0:20:47| the amount of houses that would be allowed in that zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1247)|
| 0:20:51| 4.51 acres would allow for approximately 38 to 40 houses of a lot size of 5,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1251)|
| 0:20:59| As it is, that field is essentially a marsh when there's rainfall of any amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1259)|
| 0:21:05| especially in heavy rainfall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1265)|
| 0:21:08| As I understand it, I think that Knoxville and East Tennessee generally gets more rainfall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1268)|
| 0:21:12| annually than Seattle, so this is a significant issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1272)|
| 0:21:18| There is not a storm water drainage system in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1278)|
| 0:21:22| So to reroute water, which would be happening if we put a non-porous material,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1282)|
| 0:21:29| building material like concrete, which would be necessary in a road system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1289)|
| 0:21:32| or a concrete slab, a driveway, much less 40 of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1292)|
| 0:21:36| that displaces water that would be draining into the field and then puts it out onto| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1296)|
| 0:21:41| all of the adjacent properties, ours being one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1301)|
| 0:21:46| FEMA would have to update their system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| There would be many more floodplains created by putting in a high-density housing unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1308)|
| 0:21:54| or neighborhood in this field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1314)|
| 0:21:57| The second issue is traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1317)|
| 0:21:58| You'll see that Buffett Mill looks a lot like a drag strip, and it's used like a drag strip,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1318)|
| 0:22:03| not infrequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1323)|
| 0:22:05| We have actually spoken to the city about this, and speed bumps are not allowed on that road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1325)|
| 0:22:11| because of the location of the fire department about two miles down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1331)|
| 0:22:15| closer to where Buffett Mill intersects at Whittle Springs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1335)|
| 0:22:20| They need that drag strip to get to other locations toward the east side of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1340)|
| 0:22:27| That two-lane road is already overloaded, highly trafficked, and like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1347)|
| 0:22:32| traveled on at high speeds frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1352)|
| 0:22:34| To put in the cars associated with 30 to 40 more houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1354)|
| 0:22:40| the road system is just insufficient at Buffett Mill, as is the case at Prosser as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1360)|
| 0:22:45| So we agree with your assessment that it would be a bad idea to rezone to our end, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1365)|
| 0:22:55| Thank you, Mr. Lopez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1375)|
| 0:22:56| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1376)|
| 0:22:57| Ms. Liz Porter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1377)|
| 0:23:04| Hi, I'm Liz Porter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1384)|
| 0:23:05| I live at 3534 Fountain Park Boulevard, just a little bit west of the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1385)|
| 0:23:11| I have a survey that has been signed by 51 of the neighbors, many of whom are in the audience here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1391)|
| 0:23:17| We also oppose the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1397)|
| 0:23:19| I want to thank the Planning Commission very much for recommending denial of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1399)|
| 0:23:24| It is inconsistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| Even with the R1 zoning, the lot sizes that surround that are at least 15,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1406)|
| 0:23:33| so R1 would take it down to 10,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| So we're already seeing a reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| As Michael said, anything that they do on that lot will increase the amount of impervious surface.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1418)|
| 0:23:44| So storm water is going to be an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1424)|
| 0:23:46| Traffic is an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1426)|
| 0:23:47| My location on Fountain Park Boulevard is at the bottom of a blind hill that is already dangerous enough with the 15 houses on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1427)|
| 0:23:54| I walk my dog twice a day, every day, and have to watch when my neighbors are coming in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1434)|
| 0:23:59| Fortunately, I know them, and I have an idea what their schedule is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1439)|
| 0:24:02| But you put another 30 houses there, that's not going to be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1442)|
| 0:24:06| This proposal also, I was a little curious who H.L. Container is because it's just an unusual applicant for something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1446)|
| 0:24:15| So as we move forward, I would imagine there will probably be something else that's recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1455)|
| 0:24:20| And I ask the Planning Commission to continue to stay involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1460)|
| 0:24:23| and just recognize that any development on that property is going to have a significant impact to all of the surrounding property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1463)|
| 0:24:30| that are very much opposed to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1470)|
| 0:24:32| So thank you for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1472)|
| 0:24:34| Thank you, Ms. Porter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| Ms. Ashley Helton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1476)|
| 0:24:44| Patricia Payne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1484)|
| 0:24:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1496)|
| 0:24:57| I'm Pat Payne, and I represent some of the owners across the street from Buffett Mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1497)|
| 0:25:01| The other responders have already talked to you about some of the obvious detrimental issues like traffic, and some may speak to runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1501)|
| 0:25:11| I want to just highlight a couple of the effects that maybe are a little more difficult to enumerate in dollars and cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1511)|
| 0:25:19| The neighborhood is a storied history in North Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1519)|
| 0:25:23| I grew up in the area, and I'm aware that there is already some R2 zoning in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1523)|
| 0:25:31| But if you look at the maps, you will see that even in those areas of R2, this neighborhood maintains its unique personality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1531)|
| 0:25:43| where homeowners are concerned with them and are able to take care of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1543)|
| 0:25:49| When you look at the density of the R2s, when you get closer to Whittle Springs, just east of Whittle Springs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1549)|
| 0:26:00| you'll see that kind of density is not what you see in the North Hills area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1560)|
| 0:26:05| and it's not what you see in our area, which is across Buffett Mill, where the lots are much bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1565)|
| 0:26:11| So, yes, there is already R2 in the neighborhood, but still, I think we want to maintain that personality that is so unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1571)|
| 0:26:21| Commenter Liz, in her comments, has succinctly pointed out that to drop an R2 pocket in the middle of these R1s does not make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1581)|
| 0:26:31| I will say, somehow, my property is across from a duplex that exists on Buffett Mill now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1591)|
| 0:26:39| You really need to only look at that to see that this kind of development doesn't fit and may be detrimental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1599)|
| 0:26:46| There's a very high turnover in that property across from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1606)|
| 0:26:49| There are sometimes up to five, six cars, and the whole front yard is a parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1609)|
| 0:26:55| So that's kind of that sort of thing we don't want to see in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1615)|
| 0:27:00| I don't want to believe this was just a tract that was large enough near the Amazon development that would support a development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1620)|
| 0:27:08| or that it was cheap enough to be profitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1628)|
| 0:27:15| Ms. Payne, excuse me if you could begin wrapping up your comments for the past time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1635)|
| 0:27:21| I just want to reiterate what some of the others said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1641)|
| 0:27:24| It doesn't fit into the neighborhood, and it opens the risk of deterioration of the neighborhood personality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1644)|
| 0:27:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1653)|
| 0:27:34| Thank you, Ms. Payne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1654)|
| 0:27:36| Chair, we'll entertain a motion to deny R2 per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1656)|
| 0:27:40| I'd like to make a motion to deny per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1660)|

| 0:27:48| to deny R2 single family residential neighborhood per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1668)|

| 0:28:01| Commissioner Higgins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1681)|
| 0:28:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1682)|
| 0:28:03| We have one no, Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1683)|
| 0:28:05| Motion carries with one nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1685)|

| 0:28:28| The location, south side of Hardin Valley Road, east side of English Ivy Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1708)|
| 0:28:34| Tract is 10.66 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1714)|
| 0:28:37| Present plan designation and zoning is AG agriculture, HP hillside protection, and A agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1717)|

| 0:29:59| My question is, is the two consistent with all the acreage around the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1799)|
| 0:30:08| You're addressing that to staff, I assume?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1808)|
| 0:30:10| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1810)|
| 0:30:13| Ms. Albertson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1815)|
| 0:30:18| Staff feels that two is appropriate at this location because it is in the rural area of the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1818)|
| 0:30:25| and the surrounding zoning is also around two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1825)|
| 0:30:32| This property or a portion of this property was applied for rezoning back in July, and staff recommended two at that time as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1832)|
| 0:30:44| We're remaining consistent with our previous approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1848)|
| 0:30:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1849)|
| 0:30:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1850)|
| 0:30:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1851)|
| 0:30:52| Any other comments from the public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1852)|
| 0:30:55| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1855)|
| 0:30:58| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1858)|
| 0:30:59| Commissioner Scott-Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1859)|
| 0:31:00| Liz, do you attribute the two versus three to topography or the area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1860)|
| 0:31:08| I don't think there's any one specific characteristic that determined that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1868)|
| 0:31:15| I mean, it's obviously a slope-constrained property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1875)|
| 0:31:19| If we did look at a slope analysis for the side, I think it came out to less than two dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1879)|
| 0:31:26| As far as the recommendation for density, also the surrounding zoning is also down to about two dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1886)|
| 0:31:38| Chair will entertain a motion to approve RR rural residential and HP hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1898)|
| 0:31:45| First, staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1907)|
| 0:31:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| Motion by Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1910)|
| 0:31:51| Second by Commissioner Adams to approve RR rural residential and HP hillside protection per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1911)|
| 0:32:00| All in favor of the motion, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1922)|
| 0:32:03| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1923)|
| 0:32:04| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1924)|
| 0:32:07| Next is the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1927)|
| 0:32:10| Is there a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| Commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1932)|
| 0:32:13| Is there a recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1933)|
| 0:32:19| Chair will entertain a motion to approve PR plan residential zoning up to two dwelling units per acre consistent with the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1939)|
| 0:32:29| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| The only thing that's in my mind with this is, you know, we talked about and briefed upon the need for density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1951)|
| 0:32:42| and how density improves the ability of the builder to have amenities in the subdivision and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1962)|
| 0:32:54| And people are moving here like crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1974)|
| 0:32:55| We don't have any inventory there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1975)|
| 0:32:58| I think three units per acre makes sense with this, even though I know there's stuff surrounding it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1978)|
| 0:33:05| but it doesn't necessarily mean that you can't approve something at three units just because the one next to it is two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1985)|
| 0:33:13| So I'm struggling with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1993)|
| 0:33:14| I mean, I kind of, what I want to do is give them the three units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=1994)|
| 0:33:20| So I'd like to make a motion we approve plan residential zoning up to three units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2000)|
| 0:33:27| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2007)|
| 0:33:28| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2008)|
| 0:33:29| We've got Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| I was just going to ask Liz again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| I'm looking at this analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| Commissioner, could you move the microphone a little closer to you, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2015)|
| 0:33:38| Yours is not working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2018)|
| 0:33:39| I'm not sure your mic's working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2019)|
| 0:33:42| Hello?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2022)|
| 0:33:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2023)|
| 0:33:44| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2024)|
| 0:33:45| Liz, I was looking at the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2025)|
| 0:33:51| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2031)|
| 0:33:52| Oh, maybe you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2032)|
| 0:33:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2033)|
| 0:33:54| So, yeah, it looks like, is that right, the recommended density for the slope protection is 1.9?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2034)|
| 0:33:58| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2038)|
| 0:33:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2039)|
| 0:34:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2040)|
| 0:34:01| Chair recognizes Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| Just since Commissioner Roth brought it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2044)|
| 0:34:06| is this a good time to talk about we need an upgraded growth policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2046)|
| 0:34:10| Didn't get to say it last month, so I just want to make sure this is a great time to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2050)|
| 0:34:14| We can do it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2054)|
| 0:34:15| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| I agree with some of the things that Commissioner Roth stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2057)|
| 0:34:20| that we do need to look at higher density amounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2060)|
| 0:34:23| I also understand the slope analysis, so I'm kind of in between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2063)|
| 0:34:27| So I'd love to hear just some more discussion as we move forward before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2067)|
| 0:34:31| I'll give a second just so we, to Commissioner Roth's three dwelling units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2071)|
| 0:34:35| because I'd love to just discuss it, but I'm not 100% sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| That's where we need to be right this second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2078)|
| 0:34:47| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2087)|

| 0:35:00| Commissioner Graf?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2100)|
| 0:35:04| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2104)|
| 0:35:05| On the growth, not the growth, but on the hillside protection, what did that come up to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2105)|
| 0:35:13| 1.9 was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| 1.9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2115)|
| 0:35:16| That's where we got the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2116)|

| 0:38:55| Next is agenda item number 25, file 11 SC21C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2335)|
| 0:39:01| This is the variance required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| as well as the concept plan approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2343)|
| 0:39:06| The subdivision is Ashton Point Subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2346)|
| 0:39:09| Applicant developer is Derek Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| Location, west side of Van Islesdale Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2352)|
| 0:39:15| west of Buckingham Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2355)|
| 0:39:17| Acreage is 2.33.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| Zoning is RN1, single family residential neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2360)|
| 0:39:24| and HP hillside protection overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2364)|
| 0:39:27| Proposed use, detached residential subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2367)|
| 0:39:31| There are seven lots proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| The subdivision variance reduce the minimum spacing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2374)|
| 0:39:38| between the intersection of Riley Rose Lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2378)|
| 0:39:42| and Buckingham Drive from 125 feet to 80 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2382)|
| 0:39:47| Staff recommendation approve the variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2387)|
| 0:39:49| because the site conditions restrict compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2389)|
| 0:39:52| with the subdivision regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2392)|
| 0:39:54| and the proposed variances will not create a traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2394)|
| 0:39:59| Second motion to approve the concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| subject to six conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2403)|
| 0:40:07| Mr. Jones, a representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2407)|
| 0:40:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| There are some people signed up to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2422)|
| 0:40:25| Lee Hume and Clarence Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2425)|
| 0:40:31| Is Mr. Hill present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2431)|
| 0:40:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2437)|
| 0:40:38| So give us your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2438)|
| 0:40:40| and combined you have five minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2440)|
| 0:40:42| and just be cognizant there is someone else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2442)|
| 0:40:45| who would like to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2445)|
| 0:40:46| Very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2446)|
| 0:40:50| My name is Lee Hume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2450)|
| 0:40:51| I live at 6902 Haverhill Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2451)|
| 0:40:57| Thank the commission for allowing us to comment today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2457)|
| 0:41:02| First off, typically when people want to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2462)|
| 0:41:06| any kind of development within West Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2466)|
| 0:41:07| they reach out to the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2467)|
| 0:41:10| and try to have a conversation in advance of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2470)|
| 0:41:13| The neighborhood is aware of what the intended plans are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2473)|
| 0:41:16| We have not been contacted by the owners of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2476)|
| 0:41:20| anybody affiliated with this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| And so we've learned about it kind of in a roundabout way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2482)|
| 0:41:26| that we saw the sign that was posted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| and we followed up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| And we have some concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2490)|
| 0:41:33| Number one, as I mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| we haven't been able to speak to the owner or the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2495)|
| 0:41:38| And so we're not really sure exactly what the plans are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2498)|
| 0:41:40| other than seven lots in an area that backs up to our park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2500)|
| 0:41:46| and just adjacent to it, we have a baseball field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2506)|
| 0:41:49| And we're concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| We're always concerned in West Hills about flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| and the 10 mile Creek watershed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| that this particular property is part of that watershed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2515)|
| 0:41:59| And so we know that the standards are high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2519)|
| 0:42:01| and we have had experiences in West Hills downstream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2521)|
| 0:42:05| especially in the St. Andrews area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2525)|
| 0:42:08| where there has been flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| and that's been noted several times in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2530)|
| 0:42:13| And we're concerned that this could add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2533)|
| 0:42:15| to a stormwater runoff, even though there is a detention pond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2535)|
| 0:42:19| but eventually as we see the side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2539)|
| 0:42:22| it appears that will drain into the park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2542)|
| 0:42:25| and on the baseball field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2545)|
| 0:42:29| And then eventually make its way down to St. Andrews| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2549)|
| 0:42:32| and add to the problems that they've been experiencing now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2552)|
| 0:42:35| for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2555)|
| 0:42:38| Our other concern is the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2558)|
| 0:42:41| That intersection of Buckingham and Van Osdale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2561)|
| 0:42:44| is a terrible intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2564)|
| 0:42:46| There is a stop sign on Buckingham| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2566)|
| 0:42:49| where it comes into that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| There is no stop sign at Van Osdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| People consistently ignore the stop sign on Buckingham| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2573)|
| 0:42:58| going into Van Osdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2578)|
| 0:43:00| There also have been problems with truck drivers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2580)|
| 0:43:03| that are coming off the interstate and who are lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| They end up on Buckingham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| They try to maneuver around that corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| It just doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2589)|
| 0:43:11| And then we have the school, an elementary school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2591)|
| 0:43:14| that's a block away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2594)|
| 0:43:16| And the traffic for the elementary school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2596)|
| 0:43:17| is notoriously high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| And if we have seven additional houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2599)|
| 0:43:22| which is really not a lot maybe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2602)|
| 0:43:24| but still it will contribute to the traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2604)|
| 0:43:27| that's in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2607)|
| 0:43:28| And so we are concerned about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2608)|
| 0:43:30| We would still, even regardless of whatever happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| with this development, we'd like to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2612)|
| 0:43:34| that intersection needs to be addressed and improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2614)|
| 0:43:38| And I'm not sure exactly what the remedy would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2618)|
| 0:43:40| but that's probably beyond the scope of this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2620)|
| 0:43:44| So with that, I will yield my time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2624)|
| 0:43:47| if anybody else would like to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2627)|
| 0:43:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2630)|
| 0:43:51| Thank you, Mr. Hamm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2631)|
| 0:44:01| Your pens, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2641)|
| 0:44:08| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2648)|
| 0:44:09| My name is Clarence Hill, 718 Broome Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| Knoxville, Tennessee, 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| I want to thank the commission for the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2653)|
| 0:44:17| I agree with what Mr. Lee had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2657)|
| 0:44:20| I would point out that I believe the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2660)|
| 0:44:23| is in receipt of a letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| from the West Hills Community Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| And in that letter, it was requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| that a 60 day postponement be granted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2669)|
| 0:44:32| so that we would, the community association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2672)|
| 0:44:35| and the neighbors would have an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| to understand better what the development involves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2677)|

| 0:44:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2683)|
| 0:44:47| Any other comments from the public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2687)|
| 0:44:50| Applicant is apparently not present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2690)|
| 0:44:52| Chair will recognize Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2692)|
| 0:44:55| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2695)|
| 0:44:56| Mr. Lee, one quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2696)|
| 0:44:58| Did you reach out to the applicant to request a meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2698)|
| 0:45:05| Well, I'm not really sure, you know, how to reach them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2705)|
| 0:45:11| My understanding is it may be a neighbor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2711)|
| 0:45:14| that lives just down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2714)|
| 0:45:17| But I'm not positive and I'm not exactly sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| how we'd be able to reach them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2719)|
| 0:45:21| But again, is that our obligation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2721)|
| 0:45:24| or is it their obligation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| And I mean, I don't mind, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2726)|
| 0:45:29| I'd love to have a conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2729)|
| 0:45:30| and I'm sure the community would too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2730)|
| 0:45:31| But typically, you know, the developer reaches out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2731)|
| 0:45:35| to the community association and the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2735)|
| 0:45:38| to say, you know, we're coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2738)|
| 0:45:40| We experienced it with Sonova,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2740)|
| 0:45:42| the developers that are on Broom Road, several other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2742)|
| 0:45:46| And interestingly enough, my understanding is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2746)|
| 0:45:50| that it is a neighbor who is the owner of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2750)|
| 0:45:54| and that they live diagonally across from the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2754)|
| 0:45:57| Where his home is located was an area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2757)|
| 0:46:00| that at one point was being entertained for 17 houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2760)|
| 0:46:04| There are now two houses on that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| of which if my understanding is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2766)|
| 0:46:09| that the owner of this land does live there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2769)|
| 0:46:11| it seems to me to be a bit ironic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| that he benefited from the association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2774)|
| 0:46:16| challenging a high-density development on his track of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2776)|
| 0:46:21| yet he's interested in putting in seven houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| that have basically a quarter acre lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2784)|
| 0:46:27| It just seems to me to be a little bit ironic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| but irregardless, again, as far as him contacting us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2790)|
| 0:46:35| or having any conversations, we haven't had any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2795)|
| 0:46:38| Okay, so, and the reason why I asked that question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2798)|
| 0:46:41| because my follow-up was gonna be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| has he reached out to you all in the answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2803)|
| 0:46:44| Obviously, what you just said is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2804)|
| 0:46:49| Based on this and him not being here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2809)|
| 0:46:52| my gut is that we do a 30-day postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2812)|
| 0:46:55| to allow the applicant time to come in and address this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2815)|
| 0:46:58| for the community and everything to have a chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| to contact or the applicant, if he's watching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2820)|
| 0:47:04| to reach out to the Homeowners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2824)|
| 0:47:06| I would recommend, since he hasn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| that you all in all earnest reach out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| to try and have that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2830)|
| 0:47:12| But my motion right now is gonna be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2832)|
| 0:47:13| for a 30-day postponement of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2833)|
| 0:47:18| Yeah, and that's basically what we're asking for, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2838)|
| 0:47:21| is that we'd like to be able to have a conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| and have a postponement so that we can have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| that conversation and that we have a mutual understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2845)|
| 0:47:28| about what the plans may be or what may be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2848)|
| 0:47:31| to be adjusted to, for everybody's benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2851)|
| 0:47:35| I'll second your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| Let me point out, we do not have a requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| that a developer contact the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| though we certainly encourage it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2861)|
| 0:47:44| Also, the applicant contact information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2864)|
| 0:47:48| is in the application with the department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2868)|
| 0:47:50| planning department, so you can contact them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2870)|
| 0:47:53| and get that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2873)|
| 0:47:56| Commissioner Smith, that is a motion you made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2878)|
| 0:47:59| And seconded by Commissioner Robb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2879)|

| 0:48:04| Commissioner Scott Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2884)|
| 0:48:07| All right, so we do have a motion on the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| by Commissioner Eddie Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=2889)|

| 0:50:05| with the subdivision regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3005)|

| 0:52:56| and it's been there forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3176)|
| 0:53:00| And will they be using that road down at the foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3180)|
| 0:53:04| to go to Chapman Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3184)|
| 0:53:08| or would they have their own road to go to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3188)|
| 0:53:17| Michelle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3197)|
| 0:53:20| It's Mike's case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3200)|
| 0:53:21| Oh, it's Mike's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3201)|
| 0:53:22| It might be a good question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3202)|
| 0:53:22| for the applicant themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3202)|
| 0:53:25| I can help assist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3205)|
| 0:53:26| and if the applicant needs to jump in, can too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3206)|
| 0:53:29| They will have their own road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3209)|
| 0:53:30| They will not be using yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3210)|
| 0:53:32| I can't hear him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3212)|
| 0:53:33| They will be using their own road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3213)|
| 0:53:35| They won't be using your road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3215)|
| 0:53:38| Their new road would be a little bit north of your access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3218)|
| 0:53:42| So it'd be nearby, but it will not be yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3222)|
| 0:53:45| Yours will stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3225)|
| 0:53:46| Well, now I understand in what this says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3226)|
| 0:53:50| is it 2012, what was it, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3230)|
| 0:53:54| 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3234)|
| 0:53:56| It was first approved for 94| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3236)|
| 0:54:00| and now they want to put 100 and what, did you say, 100?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3240)|
| 0:54:04| 117.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3244)|
| 0:54:06| 100 and what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3246)|
| 0:54:07| 117.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3247)|
| 0:54:08| 117.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3248)|
| 0:54:10| And what would this consist of now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3250)|
| 0:54:12| Attached houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3252)|
| 0:54:13| So kind of like townhouses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3253)|
| 0:54:19| And they will have their own access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3259)|
| 0:54:22| to go to the property from Chapman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3262)|
| 0:54:24| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3264)|
| 0:54:25| They won't be using.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3265)|
| 0:54:27| We're going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3267)|
| 0:54:29| All right, that's what I was wanting to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3269)|
| 0:54:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3273)|
| 0:54:41| Mr. Romans, would you like to say anything or are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3281)|
| 0:54:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3283)|
| 0:54:47| Mr. Chair, I'd like to make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3287)|
| 0:54:48| we approve the variances one and two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3288)|
| 0:54:51| and design standard one through three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3291)|
| 0:54:53| per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3293)|
| 0:54:58| Commissioner Boyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3298)|
| 0:54:59| Just to clarify, was there more to her question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3299)|
| 0:55:02| than just whether they'll be using the access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3302)|
| 0:55:04| but if she would still have access to that road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3304)|
| 0:55:06| She was just asking if they'll be using her private access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3306)|
| 0:55:10| and the answer is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3310)|
| 0:55:11| And if she would still have use to her private access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3311)|
| 0:55:13| Nothing's changed, I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3313)|
| 0:55:14| Is that correct, Mr. Romans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3314)|
| 0:55:17| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3317)|
| 0:55:18| Her access will remain as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3318)|
| 0:55:20| Without any special easement or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3320)|
| 0:55:23| No, it'll remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3323)|
| 0:55:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3326)|

| 0:56:16| We have a motion by Commissioner Roth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3376)|

| 0:56:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3392)|
| 0:56:34| Now item number 31, file 11C21-SU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3394)|
| 0:56:40| This is a development plan for a car wash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3400)|
| 0:56:43| Applicant is Taylor Forrester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3403)|
| 0:56:45| Location, western end of Anderson Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3405)|
| 0:56:48| south of Kingston Pike, west of south North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3408)|
| 0:56:53| Tract is 3.2 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3413)|
| 0:56:56| Zoning is IH Heavy Industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3416)|
| 0:57:00| and it's pending for a CG1 general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3420)|
| 0:57:04| Proposed use, car wash and parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3424)|
| 0:57:08| Staff recommendation, approve the development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3428)|
| 0:57:11| for a car wash facility in the CG1 zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3431)|
| 0:57:14| subject to five conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3434)|
| 0:57:17| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3437)|
| 0:57:19| Present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3439)|
| 0:57:19| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3439)|
| 0:57:23| Applicant, would you like to go first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| or would you like the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3445)|
| 0:57:26| I'd like to go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3446)|
| 0:57:27| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3447)|
| 0:57:28| Yeah, but name and address and up to five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3448)|
| 0:57:36| Taylor Forrester, 1111 North North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3456)|
| 0:57:39| Suite S700, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3459)|
| 0:57:44| Here on behalf of the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3464)|
| 0:57:47| as noted in the staff report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3467)|
| 0:57:50| the requested use of the proposed car wash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3470)|
| 0:57:53| satisfies the requirements for special use approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3473)|
| 0:57:56| for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3476)|
| 0:57:57| We have removed the request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3477)|
| 0:57:59| for the co-special use approval of a parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3479)|
| 0:58:02| and the amended site plan reflects that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3482)|
| 0:58:06| So there have been a lot of comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3486)|
| 0:58:08| as staff noted even at the gender review meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3488)|
| 0:58:12| for opposition and for proponents of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3492)|
| 0:58:16| And in fact, I've never seen so many comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3496)|
| 0:58:19| in favor of support of something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| Usually it's just me sending in something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3501)|
| 0:58:23| to support the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3503)|
| 0:58:25| The main issue, if you really dive into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3505)|
| 0:58:29| what the opposition is saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3509)|
| 0:58:31| is it doesn't center on the use of a car wash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3511)|
| 0:58:35| It centers on Anderson Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| And so this is always the case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3517)|
| 0:58:40| when you take an undeveloped property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| there's asphalt on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3522)|
| 0:58:43| but seemingly it's largely undeveloped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3523)|
| 0:58:45| has not been developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3525)|
| 0:58:46| and you take an undeveloped piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3526)|
| 0:58:48| and then you bring it out to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3528)|
| 0:58:51| There's always naturally gonna be resistance and opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3531)|
| 0:58:55| In veiling the opposition's concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3535)|
| 0:59:00| about children accessing this preschool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3540)|
| 0:59:03| we'd submit, again, removing this heavy industrial zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3543)|
| 0:59:07| and down zoning it to the commercial use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3547)|
| 0:59:10| and in fact, this proposed use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3550)|
| 0:59:12| is really the best case scenario| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3552)|
| 0:59:14| because eventually this property will be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3554)|
| 0:59:17| And if it's not rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3557)|
| 0:59:19| it would be developed under heavy industrial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3559)|
| 0:59:22| And as noted in the staff report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3562)|
| 0:59:24| with the proposed full service car wash,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3564)|
| 0:59:28| the timing of the peak times and the operation times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3568)|
| 0:59:33| seemingly aligned perfectly with the preschool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3573)|
| 0:59:37| The preschool drop off is from 8.30 to 9 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3577)|
| 0:59:40| and the car wash's busy hours are from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3580)|
| 0:59:45| The pickup, first pickup I believe is at 2 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3585)|
| 0:59:48| and then there's an aftercare or late care pickup at 4 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3588)|
| 0:59:52| The car wash's busiest days are on Friday and Saturday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3592)|
| 0:59:57| and this daycare is not open on Friday and Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3597)|
| 1:00:01| And that preschool is the accessory use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| to the main function of the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3603)|
| 1:00:05| Seemingly the largest crowd would be on Sundays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3605)|
| 1:00:09| with people coming to the church service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3609)|
| 1:00:11| and this car wash is not open on Sundays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3611)|
| 1:00:14| So again, when you look at what could go here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3614)|
| 1:00:19| what is being proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3619)|
| 1:00:20| we submit that this is an appropriate use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3620)|
| 1:00:22| for special use approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3622)|
| 1:00:25| Again, would we rather have direct Dean Hill access?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3625)|
| 1:00:28| Absolutely, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3628)|
| 1:00:30| But the way this property is situated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3630)|
| 1:00:32| our only access is through Anderson Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3632)|
| 1:00:35| which is a public right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| We have the right just as any of our neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| including the church or surrounding properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3639)|
| 1:00:41| have to use Anderson Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3641)|
| 1:00:47| Mr. King, representing the church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3647)|
| 1:00:51| has indicated they would like to see an office back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3651)|
| 1:00:54| I'd submit that an office is gonna have 3.2 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3654)|
| 1:00:58| the size of an office you could develop there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3658)|
| 1:01:01| and I know at my office, the Landmark Center's there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| a mile from this property, if that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3663)|
| 1:01:07| the busiest time is 8 a.m. to 9 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3667)|
| 1:01:10| when everybody is coming to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3670)|
| 1:01:12| Again, looking at the non-conflict in the hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3672)|
| 1:01:16| the car wash is a low impact use for this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3676)|
| 1:01:20| You know, if approved, we'll continue to work with the church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3680)|
| 1:01:24| and develop this in a manner that works for both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3684)|
| 1:01:29| Again, would much prefer and have sought Dean Hill access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3689)|
| 1:01:34| on countless opportunities and on countless occasions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3694)|
| 1:01:38| but have not been able to be granted that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3698)|
| 1:01:40| I'd like to reserve the rest of my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3700)|
| 1:01:42| Thank you, Mr. Forrester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3702)|
| 1:01:45| Mr. King?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3705)|
| 1:01:51| Mr. King, are you representing the church?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3711)|
| 1:01:55| I'm trying to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3717)|
| 1:01:58| There are several people that have signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3718)|
| 1:02:01| I didn't know if you were speaking on their behalf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3721)|
| 1:02:04| or just the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3724)|
| 1:02:05| I'm speaking on behalf of the church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3725)|
| 1:02:09| and a number of its members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3729)|
| 1:02:11| but there are a number of the members who I don't represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3731)|
| 1:02:17| I understand some want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3737)|
| 1:02:21| One I know was a Mrs. Miller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3741)|
| 1:02:24| I don't know whether she's here or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3744)|
| 1:02:27| but I know she wanted to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3747)|
| 1:02:30| I'm not sure what we're going to do with the five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3750)|
| 1:02:33| There are two of us, there are two of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3753)|
| 1:02:35| Right, why don't you go ahead and start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3755)|
| 1:02:37| and then kind of be considerate of those who want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3757)|
| 1:02:41| And if the commission needs to grant additional time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3761)|
| 1:02:44| I doubt there'll be any objection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3764)|
| 1:02:46| but go ahead and give us your name and address, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3766)|
| 1:02:50| John King, P.O. Box 2425, North of Tennessee, 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3770)|
| 1:02:58| This is a toughie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3778)|
| 1:03:01| There are different assertions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3781)|
| 1:03:03| there are opposing assertions made by representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3783)|
| 1:03:08| of the applicant and the opponents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3788)|
| 1:03:11| So I'm going to start with some known facts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3791)|
| 1:03:13| not those in dispute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3793)|
| 1:03:16| and looking at this special use request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3796)|
| 1:03:20| The church has been there since 1847| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3800)|
| 1:03:24| at that same site operating its ministry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3804)|
| 1:03:28| in conformity with its acknowledged and permitted activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3808)|
| 1:03:32| The church cannot simply pick up and move away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3812)|
| 1:03:36| from a use that inhibits, changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3816)|
| 1:03:40| lessens or constrains its use of its property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3820)|
| 1:03:44| whereas the proposed use has that opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3824)|
| 1:03:48| to change its location to one more suitable for its use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3828)|
| 1:03:55| A few things to keep in mind in regard to this special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3835)|
| 1:04:01| The ordinance recognizes that there are certain uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3841)|
| 1:04:06| which because of their unique characteristics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3846)|
| 1:04:08| are potentially incompatible with existing development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3848)|
| 1:04:13| or because the effects of that use cannot be foreseen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3853)|
| 1:04:17| That's the reason you have a special use permit procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3857)|
| 1:04:21| The ordinance further provides that the listing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3861)|
| 1:04:24| of a use as to property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3864)|
| 1:04:28| listing of a special use does not constitute an assurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3868)|
| 1:04:32| or presumption that such special use will be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3872)|
| 1:04:36| It is indeed up to you to determine that it is appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3876)|
| 1:04:42| at the particular location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3882)|
| 1:04:44| and in the particular manner proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3884)|
| 1:04:47| The ordinance then says the proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3887)|
| 1:04:49| must meet all of the criteria set out in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3889)|
| 1:04:54| Among those that are set out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3894)|
| 1:04:57| relevant if you will in this instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3897)|
| 1:05:00| is you have to determine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3900)|
| 1:05:03| you have to determine that the use is compatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3903)|
| 1:05:06| with the character of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3906)|
| 1:05:08| where it is proposed and with the size and location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3908)|
| 1:05:12| of the buildings in the vicinity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3912)|
| 1:05:15| You have to determine that the use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3915)|
| 1:05:18| will not significantly injure the value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3918)|
| 1:05:21| of adjacent property by noise, lights, fumes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3921)|
| 1:05:25| odors, vibrations, traffic, congestion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3925)|
| 1:05:29| or other impacts which detract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3929)|
| 1:05:32| from the immediate environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3932)|
| 1:05:35| Last, as written, or very relevant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3935)|
| 1:05:38| is the use must not be of a nature or so located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3938)|
| 1:05:43| as to draw substantial additional traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3943)|
| 1:05:46| through residential streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3946)|
| 1:05:48| Residential streets is not a defined term in your ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3948)|
| 1:05:52| but local streets are, I submit to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3952)|
| 1:05:56| what we've got involved here is at best a local street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3956)|
| 1:06:00| A local street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3960)|
| 1:06:02| It's about two and a half blocks long from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3962)|
| 1:06:06| once you get to it from Henry Childs Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3966)|
| 1:06:11| and on to Anderson, at best it's maybe three blocks long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3971)|
| 1:06:17| This proposed use does not meet these standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3977)|
| 1:06:21| We ask that it be denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3981)|
| 1:06:24| Our alternative is, I have said I would ask to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3984)|
| 1:06:28| if there was an opportunity for a postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3988)|
| 1:06:31| so we could arrange a properly noticed session at the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3991)|
| 1:06:36| so you could see more readily how this street operates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=3996)|
| 1:06:42| Church is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4002)|
| 1:06:44| I didn't ask for a crowd, but the minister's here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4004)|
| 1:06:47| and apparently when he's here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4007)|
| 1:06:49| a number of people become more interested in being here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4009)|
| 1:06:52| with the people from the churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4012)|
| 1:06:54| And in opposition, as a matter of fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4014)|
| 1:06:56| I'm just gonna stand up quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4016)|
| 1:07:07| You're up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4027)|
| 1:07:10| My name is Susan Finley, 7318 Stockton Drive, 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4030)|
| 1:07:17| I'm a longtime member of Central Baptist Spirit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4037)|
| 1:07:20| and involved in most of the ministries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4040)|
| 1:07:22| I wanna talk to you about today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4042)|
| 1:07:24| Yes, we are very concerned about two intersections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4044)|
| 1:07:28| that are affected by this special use request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4048)|
| 1:07:32| One is the intersection at Dean Hill Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4052)|
| 1:07:35| Kingston Pike, and Henry Childs Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4055)|
| 1:07:38| That is an extremely dangerous intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4058)|

| 1:07:42| Cars 10 back can line up on Dean Hill Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4062)|
| 1:07:45| five back from Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4065)|
| 1:07:48| trying to make that V-shaped intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4068)|
| 1:07:51| and then Henry Childs Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4071)|
| 1:07:52| which you'd have to access to get to Anderson Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4072)|
| 1:07:55| is right there in that mix,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4075)|
| 1:07:57| and it is an accident waiting to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4077)|
| 1:08:00| The other intersection we're so concerned about today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4080)|
| 1:08:03| is the intersection of Henry Childs Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4083)|
| 1:08:07| and Anderson Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4087)|
| 1:08:08| and the part of Anderson Avenue that we're concerned with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4088)|
| 1:08:11| is the part that intersects there at Dean Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4091)|
| 1:08:15| at Henry Childs to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4095)|
| 1:08:18| It's just literally a block long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4098)|
| 1:08:20| completely surrounded by property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4100)|
| 1:08:22| owned by Central Baptist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4102)|
| 1:08:25| We are not just a Sunday church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4105)|
| 1:08:27| We operate in ministries every single day of the week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4107)|
| 1:08:32| for the community around us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4112)|
| 1:08:34| Yes, we're very concerned because we have 175 preschoolers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4114)|
| 1:08:38| whose families park in the two lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4118)|
| 1:08:40| adjacent to the intersection I'm talking to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4120)|
| 1:08:43| These are infants, toddlers, preschoolers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4123)|
| 1:08:47| Their parents have to walk them into our preschool area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4127)|
| 1:08:50| and this is the accessible area that they use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4130)|
| 1:08:53| They come in with strollers, with book bags,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4133)|
| 1:08:57| with diaper bags, and their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4137)|
| 1:09:01| There are pictures that we have provided to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4141)|
| 1:09:03| We loaded them on the public comment section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4143)|
| 1:09:05| and I hope you've had an opportunity to look at those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4145)|
| 1:09:09| and to see the heavy use that happens every morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4149)|
| 1:09:12| and every afternoon, Monday through Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4152)|
| 1:09:15| In addition, directly to-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4155)|
| 1:09:16| Excuse me, Ms. Finley, unless there's any opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4156)|
| 1:09:20| we grant additional three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4160)|
| 1:09:23| Let them go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4163)|
| 1:09:24| Huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4164)|
| 1:09:24| Let them go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4164)|
| 1:09:25| Well, we will, but we have to offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4165)|
| 1:09:27| the same thing to Mr. Forrest first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4167)|
| 1:09:29| I mean, I think three minutes, and if we need to go further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4169)|
| 1:09:31| we can discuss it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4171)|
| 1:09:32| So, again, look at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4172)|
| 1:09:35| and you've got Ms. Eleanor and Bill Barron| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4175)|
| 1:09:39| and Rachel Miller and Connor Cole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4179)|
| 1:09:42| that would like to speak tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4182)|
| 1:09:43| Why don't you just make it five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4183)|
| 1:09:45| All right, we'll add another five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4185)|
| 1:09:46| Add five minutes there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4186)|
| 1:09:48| I will speak quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4188)|
| 1:09:48| All right, thank you, Mr. Forrester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4188)|
| 1:09:50| You have an additional five minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4190)|
| 1:09:51| plus what you have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4191)|
| 1:09:52| In addition to the preschool weekday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4192)|
| 1:09:54| we also have directly to the south the Bloom Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4194)|
| 1:09:57| which our church has developed as a ministry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4197)|
| 1:09:59| to special needs high school students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4199)|
| 1:10:01| from two different high schools and for young adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4201)|
| 1:10:05| They come two days a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4205)|
| 1:10:06| and we give them opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4206)|
| 1:10:09| to learn horticulture and gardening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4209)|
| 1:10:11| and that access is there at that particular intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4211)|
| 1:10:15| We have Bible study fellowship women,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4215)|
| 1:10:17| 200 women who come every week to the church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4217)|
| 1:10:20| the Halloran Hill Weekly Bible Study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4220)|
| 1:10:22| the Bill Barron Weekly Bible Study, Vacation Bible School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4222)|
| 1:10:27| We have just had approved by the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4227)|
| 1:10:29| additions to our property there to the south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4229)|
| 1:10:32| to put a prayer garden, a columbarium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4232)|
| 1:10:36| and an outdoor classroom immediately adjacent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4236)|
| 1:10:40| to this property on Anderson Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4240)|
| 1:10:43| We have meals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4243)|
| 1:10:45| We feed over 200 people on Wednesday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4245)|
| 1:10:47| On Tuesday for lunch, we feed 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4247)|
| 1:10:50| We prepare food that comes out of the kitchen door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4250)|
| 1:10:53| that's right at that intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4253)|
| 1:10:55| that we take to the families at the Ronald McDonald House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4255)|
| 1:10:58| Just this past weekend, over Halloween,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4258)|
| 1:11:01| we had 1,000 people in those parking lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4261)|
| 1:11:03| We get special permission from the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4263)|
| 1:11:05| to close Henry Childs Avenue and Anderson Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4265)|
| 1:11:09| so we can offer this to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4269)|
| 1:11:12| These are dangerous intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4272)|
| 1:11:14| It is not appropriate to have a car wash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4274)|
| 1:11:17| that's expecting 200 to 250 cars a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4277)|
| 1:11:21| that's 500 round trips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4281)|
| 1:11:23| to access this very narrow, small area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4283)|
| 1:11:26| We would ask that you do not grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4286)|
| 1:11:30| this special use approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4290)|
| 1:11:32| In the alternative, we would ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4292)|
| 1:11:34| that you give us a 30-day postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4294)|
| 1:11:37| because we believe that the MPC staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4297)|
| 1:11:40| did not have an accurate and adequate material| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4300)|
| 1:11:45| for them when they made their staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4305)|
| 1:11:48| As we read the application, which we got late,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4308)|
| 1:11:50| we did not see it early,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4310)|
| 1:11:52| we think some of the information there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4312)|
| 1:11:53| is inaccurate and inadequate to make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4313)|
| 1:11:57| So either to not, we ask you to deny it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4317)|
| 1:12:00| or in the alternative, to give us 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4320)|
| 1:12:02| to have a site visit and to have more information provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4322)|
| 1:12:06| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4326)|
| 1:12:07| Thank you, Ms. Finley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4327)|
| 1:12:09| Eleanor or Bill Barron?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4329)|
| 1:12:15| Rachel Miller?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4335)|
| 1:12:19| Hi, my name is Rachel Miller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4339)|
| 1:12:22| My address is 1829 Poplar Hill Road, 37922,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4342)|
| 1:12:26| and I'm a mother of a preschooler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4346)|
| 1:12:27| who attends Central Baptist Preschool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4347)|
| 1:12:30| I'm here today to speak out against the approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4350)|
| 1:12:32| of the purchase of the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4352)|
| 1:12:33| behind my daughter's preschool playground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4353)|
| 1:12:35| by Harper Auto for a car wash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4355)|
| 1:12:37| I know Harper Auto to be a local business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4357)|
| 1:12:40| owned by caring people with family values,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4360)|
| 1:12:42| and we are asking of them to value our 175 families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4362)|
| 1:12:47| at Central Baptist Preschool with this decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4367)|
| 1:12:49| and choose another safer location for their car wash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4369)|
| 1:12:53| The sole entry and exit points for this car wash,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4373)|
| 1:12:55| as previously stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4375)|
| 1:12:57| are along the same side streets that my daughter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4377)|
| 1:12:59| and 175 other children cross each morning and afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4379)|
| 1:13:02| to get to and from the parking lot to the school building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4382)|
| 1:13:05| Harper Auto notes that the car wash would bring traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4385)|
| 1:13:08| of an additional 250 cars per day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4388)|
| 1:13:11| which is 500 trips up and down Anderson and Henry Childs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4391)|
| 1:13:14| during the school day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4394)|
| 1:13:16| They also estimate that peak times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4396)|
| 1:13:18| are from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4398)|
| 1:13:20| which directly interferes with a safe pickup time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4400)|
| 1:13:23| for my daughter and her friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4403)|
| 1:13:25| I am deeply concerned about the safety of my daughter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4405)|
| 1:13:27| and her peers if this deal goes through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4407)|
| 1:13:30| I also bring with me 513 signatures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4410)|
| 1:13:33| from other concerned parents and grandparents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4413)|
| 1:13:36| and other community members who are against this purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4416)|
| 1:13:39| All of these were obtained within the last 24 hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4419)|
| 1:13:41| which shows how serious we are taking this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4421)|
| 1:13:45| These parents expressed concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4425)|
| 1:13:46| about balancing backpacks and strollers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4426)|
| 1:13:48| and holding children's hands across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4428)|
| 1:13:51| which is a feat that I know well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4431)|
| 1:13:52| because I do it every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4432)|
| 1:13:54| as well as the myriad safety concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4434)|
| 1:13:56| that this additional traffic brings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4436)|
| 1:13:58| There is also the concern by a social worker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4438)|
| 1:14:00| that was shared with me that this car wash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4440)|
| 1:14:02| could actually lead to child trafficking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4442)|
| 1:14:04| as a child could be kidnapped quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4444)|
| 1:14:05| and taken to the car wash to alter their appearance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4445)|
| 1:14:08| As a mother, this thought terrifies me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4448)|
| 1:14:11| It has come to my attention that Harper Auto| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4451)|
| 1:14:13| is offering a few solutions that I would like to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4453)|
| 1:14:15| to the ineffectiveness of these solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4455)|
| 1:14:18| First, they have offered to do a crosswalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4458)|
| 1:14:21| and I hope that the photos that have been uploaded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4461)|
| 1:14:23| will show you that this is a chaotic time in the morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4463)|
| 1:14:26| where 175 children are crossing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4466)|
| 1:14:28| and they can't be expected to cross all in a small area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4468)|
| 1:14:31| just due to where the streets are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4471)|
| 1:14:33| with Anderson Drive and Henry Childs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4473)|
| 1:14:35| They're crossing all over those streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4475)|
| 1:14:37| so there's really not an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4477)|
| 1:14:38| for a crosswalk to be effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4478)|
| 1:14:40| Secondly, the fire lane has been offered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4480)|
| 1:14:43| as an opportunity for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4483)|
| 1:14:45| and that just simply will not work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4485)|
| 1:14:46| I've spoken with staff members at the preschool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4486)|
| 1:14:48| and it's not feasible for our families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4488)|
| 1:14:50| to drop off and pick up in this small area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4490)|
| 1:14:53| The best solution is for Harper Auto| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4493)|
| 1:14:54| to choose a different location for their car wash,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4494)|
| 1:14:57| and one that will not interfere with the safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4497)|
| 1:14:59| of 175 precious little lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4499)|
| 1:15:02| I humbly ask, along with the 513 other signatures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4502)|
| 1:15:06| of families and constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4506)|
| 1:15:07| who took the time to sign this petition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4507)|
| 1:15:10| it's 12 pages long of sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4510)|
| 1:15:13| and that the Knox County Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4513)|
| 1:15:15| vote down this purchase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4515)|
| 1:15:16| and ask Harper Auto to find another safer location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4516)|
| 1:15:19| for their car wash that does not endanger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4519)|
| 1:15:21| the safety of our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4521)|
| 1:15:23| Thank you for your consideration and your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4523)|
| 1:15:27| Thank you, Ms. Miller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4527)|
| 1:15:28| Cole Connor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4528)|
| 1:15:34| Commissioners, we have expired the five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4534)|
| 1:15:36| Would you like an additional time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4536)|
| 1:15:43| Additional three minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4543)|
| 1:15:45| will that be sufficient to thank you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4545)|
| 1:15:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4547)|
| 1:15:48| Your name and address, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4548)|
| 1:15:49| and you have up to three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4549)|
| 1:15:50| My name is Connor C. Cole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4550)|
| 1:15:51| I live at 400 Hitchcock Way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4551)|
| 1:15:53| apartment 1016, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4553)|
| 1:15:58| I come as a parent that attends the daycare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4558)|
| 1:16:02| I was not aware of all the details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4562)|
| 1:16:03| that go into his preparation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4563)|
| 1:16:07| of what will be established in times of operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4567)|
| 1:16:10| My only concern, then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4570)|
| 1:16:11| after hearing everyone else's points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4571)|
| 1:16:14| which I hope you consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4574)|
| 1:16:15| my only question is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4575)|
| 1:16:17| Currently, he says it'll only operate on Friday and Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4577)|
| 1:16:20| What guarantees does he have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4580)|
| 1:16:21| that that will remain consistent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4581)|
| 1:16:23| Businesses not go well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4583)|
| 1:16:25| or times of operation do not suffice their endeavors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4585)|
| 1:16:28| Will that not change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4588)|
| 1:16:30| What assurances do we have that that will not change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4590)|
| 1:16:34| What guarantees do we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4594)|
| 1:16:35| that they will be considering everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4595)|
| 1:16:37| that will be happening that the church establishes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4597)|
| 1:16:39| and carries out throughout the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4599)|
| 1:16:41| if not in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4601)|
| 1:16:42| My other concern is that if there's other alternatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4602)|
| 1:16:45| a crosswalk would not be sufficient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4605)|
| 1:16:47| as there's multiple entry points and exits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4607)|
| 1:16:50| from the facility for the daycare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4610)|
| 1:16:52| the Bloom Center, and other facilities they will establish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4612)|
| 1:16:55| as well as they could consider other alternatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4615)|
| 1:16:59| which they can discuss if a postponement of 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4619)|
| 1:17:03| is offered, such as milk posts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4623)|
| 1:17:05| do guarantee no traffic at certain times of operation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4625)|
| 1:17:08| although who would install those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4628)|
| 1:17:09| and maintain them would be up to question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4629)|
| 1:17:12| With that, I yield the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4632)|
| 1:17:15| to whoever else wishes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4635)|
| 1:17:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4637)|
| 1:17:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4638)|
| 1:17:22| Mr. Forrester, you've got eight additional minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4642)|
| 1:17:25| in addition to what you already have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4645)|
| 1:17:26| so a lot of talk in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4646)|
| 1:17:28| I don't think I have eight minutes in me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4648)|
| 1:17:31| Just to kind of respond to some of the comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4651)|
| 1:17:36| and I know this can be hard for people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4656)|
| 1:17:40| that aren't here all the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4660)|
| 1:17:41| or aren't in the development world or property world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4661)|
| 1:17:46| that undeveloped property can be developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4666)|
| 1:17:51| according to what the zoning ordinance allows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4671)|
| 1:17:56| It was discussed at length last meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4676)|
| 1:17:59| as to what the current zoning of heavy industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4679)|
| 1:18:03| allows on this property, the type of uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4683)|
| 1:18:06| And they were offensive type uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4686)|
| 1:18:09| uses that would have a lot of impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4689)|
| 1:18:11| And those uses, their only access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4691)|
| 1:18:14| would be through Anderson Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4694)|
| 1:18:18| Again, nobody could put a moratorium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4698)|
| 1:18:22| over using the property for how it's zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4702)|
| 1:18:25| I'll point out as an example of how a car wash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4705)|
| 1:18:30| seems to effectively work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4710)|
| 1:18:33| it would be at Bearden Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4713)|
| 1:18:34| the Zips car wash there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4714)|
| 1:18:37| I would submit Kingston Pike, that area in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4717)|
| 1:18:40| just has a traffic jam and log pretty much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4720)|
| 1:18:43| anytime in the morning, lunch, or evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4723)|
| 1:18:46| And school pickup and school drop off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4726)|
| 1:18:49| still continues to happen, and they use the same access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4729)|
| 1:18:55| We offered and proposed alternative accesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4735)|
| 1:19:02| and not to use Anderson Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4742)|
| 1:19:05| We requested an access easement from the church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4745)|
| 1:19:08| on their far western parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4748)|
| 1:19:11| which currently serves as a parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4751)|
| 1:19:12| And so that was the reason for the co-special use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4752)|
| 1:19:15| application is if that was agreed to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4755)|
| 1:19:19| and that could be worked out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4759)|
| 1:19:20| whatever parking spaces they lost there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4760)|
| 1:19:23| we would build them on our property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4763)|
| 1:19:24| and they would have access to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4764)|
| 1:19:28| We would not use Anderson Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4768)|
| 1:19:30| This access easement from Dean Hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4770)|
| 1:19:32| would be our sole exclusive access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4772)|
| 1:19:35| And as many times we offered that, that was refused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4775)|
| 1:19:40| So again, I think this is an appropriate use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4780)|
| 1:19:44| Property is gonna be developed by somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4784)|
| 1:19:49| And I would submit that developing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4789)|
| 1:19:51| under current zoning coordinates is not the best,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4791)|
| 1:19:53| and that this is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4793)|
| 1:19:55| And request that you approve the special use request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4795)|
| 1:19:58| subject to the conditions set forth in the staff report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4798)|
| 1:20:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4801)|
| 1:20:02| Thank you, Mr. Forrester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4802)|
| 1:20:06| All right, chair will recognize Commissioner Boyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4806)|
| 1:20:09| Mr. Forrester, I have a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4809)|
| 1:20:12| Can you help me with the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4812)|
| 1:20:16| and we probably need a slide of the photograph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4816)|
| 1:20:23| The aerial of Anderson and it shows the little boxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4823)|
| 1:20:27| with the church located, the drop off site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4827)|
| 1:20:32| the parking lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4832)|
| 1:20:37| So when the attendees of the church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4837)|
| 1:20:42| the preschool come down Anderson Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4842)|
| 1:20:44| say off South Weisgarber or whichever way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4844)|
| 1:20:47| even off Henry, and they go behind the church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4847)|
| 1:20:51| to that drop off area, the road dead ends, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4851)|
| 1:20:56| Anderson stops, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4856)|
| 1:20:58| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4858)|
| 1:20:59| So is the proposition that Harper Auto| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4859)|
| 1:21:05| will close that area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4865)|
| 1:21:08| Will that road be, will they be able to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4868)|
| 1:21:10| on that property and go out on Dean Hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4870)|
| 1:21:13| sort of like they do now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4873)|
| 1:21:14| So they're not making a U-turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4874)|
| 1:21:16| Well, is that what you're proposing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4876)|
| 1:21:18| Or are you proposing to leave that open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4878)|
| 1:21:21| Because right now that road dead ends there, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4881)|
| 1:21:25| And you could, will you lock the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4885)|
| 1:21:27| when it's not in use at night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4887)|
| 1:21:28| Or will it stay wide open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4888)|
| 1:21:30| Or will the church goers and the preschool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4890)|
| 1:21:33| will they be forced to go take a U-turn there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4893)|
| 1:21:36| Does that make sense what I'm asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4896)|
| 1:21:37| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4897)|
| 1:21:38| And I remember you asking this at a general review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4898)|
| 1:21:42| My understanding is that drop off isn't used for drop off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4902)|
| 1:21:47| That's maybe what it was designed for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4907)|
| 1:21:48| but it's not used for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4908)|
| 1:21:50| Well, some use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4910)|
| 1:21:51| I know preschoolers need to, but senior citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4911)|
| 1:21:53| folks who don't want to go up those long stairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4913)|
| 1:21:55| up the front side, it's used by lots of folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4915)|
| 1:21:58| The BSF parks back all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4918)|
| 1:22:01| I mean, it's a large church, but...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4921)|
| 1:22:04| So we would not be blocking off the property, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4924)|
| 1:22:06| Where it starts, one thing to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4926)|
| 1:22:09| would be the buffer requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4929)|
| 1:22:13| since we are located next to an institutional use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4933)|
| 1:22:16| I believe there's a 20 or 25 foot landscape buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4936)|
| 1:22:20| and also requires fencing along our property line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4940)|
| 1:22:24| to the adjacent property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4944)|
| 1:22:25| So that doesn't...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4945)|
| 1:22:28| So will they be able to go straight onto Harper property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4948)|
| 1:22:31| to turn right and go out Dean Hill that way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4951)|
| 1:22:35| Or will that be blocked off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4955)|
| 1:22:38| once the project is complete and in operation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4958)|
| 1:22:41| Shane, come up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4961)|
| 1:22:43| No, come up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4963)|
| 1:22:47| I'm just saying, I know the landscape requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4967)|
| 1:22:48| would require that whole area to have a fence, a privacy fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4968)|
| 1:22:52| But as far as whether that could be...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4972)|
| 1:22:56| Yeah, hi, Shane and Harper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4976)|
| 1:22:58| Yeah, 3804 Kenworth Drive, Knoxville 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4978)|
| 1:23:04| Yeah, to answer your question, Tamara, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4984)|
| 1:23:06| We would love to close down access to Anderson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4986)|
| 1:23:11| to avoid any sort of complications with the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4991)|
| 1:23:14| It frees up any sort of cross traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4994)|
| 1:23:16| ever coming through there to protect the safety of the kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4996)|
| 1:23:19| So our goal would be route 100% of the traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=4999)|
| 1:23:23| through the western edge of 6318 Dean Hill Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5003)|
| 1:23:27| No, she's asking, I'm not having that easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5007)|
| 1:23:29| but we're using Anderson coming through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5009)|
| 1:23:33| That traffic's there, how do they turn back around?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5013)|
| 1:23:36| Will they have access to the site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5016)|
| 1:23:38| Yeah, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5018)|
| 1:23:39| So, but Shannon, when things are closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5019)|
| 1:23:42| are they gonna come, or when the car wash is closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5022)|
| 1:23:45| say it's 10 o'clock at night, is there going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5025)|
| 1:23:49| is it gonna be locked, like the car lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5029)|
| 1:23:50| or something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5030)|
| 1:23:51| Is it gonna be locked at night with gates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5031)|
| 1:23:53| and unaccessible for folks to drive through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5033)|
| 1:23:56| And I'm not really concerned about 10 at night, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5036)|
| 1:23:59| We would have it locked at night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5039)|
| 1:24:00| but it'd be similar to our out west facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5040)|
| 1:24:02| We work with Cokesbury Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5042)|
| 1:24:03| when they have Christmas, Easter, extra crowds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5043)|
| 1:24:07| we work with them, they have a key to our gate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5047)|
| 1:24:08| and we have a mutual agreement with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5048)|
| 1:24:11| They use our ingress and regress when we need be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5051)|
| 1:24:14| and that would be the goal with the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5054)|
| 1:24:15| If they say, hey, look, we need extra space for Christmas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5055)|
| 1:24:18| we'd say, hey, here's the key, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5058)|
| 1:24:20| But on a daily basis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5060)|
| 1:24:23| Well, yeah, I mean, at night, we would lock it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5063)|
| 1:24:26| You would want to lock it up, I mean, is what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5066)|
| 1:24:28| Yeah, yeah, I mean, we don't want anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5068)|
| 1:24:30| you know, the traffickers that was mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5070)|
| 1:24:32| we want to make sure the traffickers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5072)|
| 1:24:33| don't get onto the lot at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5073)|
| 1:24:37| That help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5077)|
| 1:24:38| Mostly, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5078)|
| 1:24:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5079)|
| 1:24:43| Mr. King, we are in discussion now with the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5083)|
| 1:24:46| so unless there's a specific question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5086)|
| 1:24:48| What I think may be a misunderstanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5088)|
| 1:24:51| on somebody's part, going back and forth here about the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5091)|
| 1:24:56| Can you speak closer to the microphone, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5096)|
| 1:25:00| Limit your comments, because we're-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5100)|
| 1:25:01| About the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5101)|
| 1:25:03| This road currently, the construction part of the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5103)|
| 1:25:09| stops at the point up there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5109)|
| 1:25:14| as you're heading down Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5114)|
| 1:25:18| It's a public street, and it extends beyond there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5118)|
| 1:25:23| There's a problem about blocking off a public street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5123)|
| 1:25:28| or lock it up at night, or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5128)|
| 1:25:31| There's an issue there about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5131)|
| 1:25:34| whether you can really do that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5134)|
| 1:25:36| But currently, you go into this property on Anderson Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5136)|
| 1:25:43| which, by the way, is not even listed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5143)|
| 1:25:46| on the city's road plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5146)|
| 1:25:49| You go in on Anderson Drive, and you go out the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5149)|
| 1:25:55| There is no access to Dean Hill Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5155)|
| 1:26:00| and there were issues presented by the suggestion that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5160)|
| 1:26:05| well, let's close down Anderson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5165)|
| 1:26:07| and we'll use Dean Hill Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5167)|
| 1:26:12| There are issues because it divides property that we own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5172)|
| 1:26:19| makes a division of it, and in addition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5179)|
| 1:26:22| it interferes with legal binding issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5182)|
| 1:26:30| with a building that's there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5190)|
| 1:26:32| about using some of the parking that we can't use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5192)|
| 1:26:34| Mr. King, we need to move on and let commissioners speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5194)|
| 1:26:38| Hey, just-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5198)|
| 1:26:38| Just further, I've got clarification on it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5198)|
| 1:26:41| So can you pull up the site plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5201)|
| 1:26:44| And so to answer your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5204)|
| 1:26:45| I couldn't answer from our client,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5205)|
| 1:26:46| and I don't think he fully understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5206)|
| 1:26:48| So where would it be locked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5208)|
| 1:26:50| You said where you turn left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5210)|
| 1:26:51| would come actually into the washing area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5211)|
| 1:26:53| Those were there and on the respective opposite side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5213)|
| 1:26:56| where you'd exit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5216)|
| 1:26:57| And so assuming we were relieved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5217)|
| 1:26:59| of certain landscape requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5219)|
| 1:27:01| that require a fence along that northern line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5221)|
| 1:27:03| yes, we would leave that open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5223)|
| 1:27:06| So they could come all the way through, straight ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5226)|
| 1:27:08| So, Mr. Forrester, what I hear you saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5228)|
| 1:27:09| is the property access in the shaded gray,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5229)|
| 1:27:12| that would all stay open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5232)|
| 1:27:15| and the locked portion to the new area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5235)|
| 1:27:18| would be only at the-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5238)|
| 1:27:23| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5243)|
| 1:27:24| Perpendicular line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5244)|
| 1:27:25| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5245)|
| 1:27:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5247)|
| 1:27:27| And like I said, assuming we were relieved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5247)|
| 1:27:29| of the fencing and buffering requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5249)|
| 1:27:32| to some degree or some type of relief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5252)|
| 1:27:35| they could still go right towards Dean Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5255)|
| 1:27:37| And then, what I heard Shannon say at first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5257)|
| 1:27:41| the first was that you all are still amenable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5261)|
| 1:27:45| to having an access in another-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5265)|
| 1:27:47| Oh, 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5267)|
| 1:27:48| Location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5268)|
| 1:27:49| To not even come across Anderson whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5269)|
| 1:27:51| Always been our preference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5271)|
| 1:27:52| Always been our preference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5272)|
| 1:27:54| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5274)|
| 1:27:55| And I guess the neighboring site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5275)|
| 1:27:56| where the self-storage is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5276)|
| 1:27:58| we've approached them and tried to come in their drive aisle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5278)|
| 1:28:01| It's not on there, but it's right next, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5281)|
| 1:28:05| Their drive aisle, come behind that office there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5285)|
| 1:28:07| We've approached those for access easements as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5287)|
| 1:28:09| weren't successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5289)|
| 1:28:12| Chair recognizes Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5292)|
| 1:28:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5294)|
| 1:28:16| First of all, I want to say I understand the concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5296)|
| 1:28:21| but I want to reiterate and remind that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5301)|
| 1:28:24| when this was heavy industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5304)|
| 1:28:27| there could have been 18 wheelers coming in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5307)|
| 1:28:30| nonstop, by right, and that wouldn't have changed anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5310)|
| 1:28:35| I've been sitting here thinking that I had a great idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5315)|
| 1:28:37| and I was going to make this suggestion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5317)|
| 1:28:39| and then I realized that everyone else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5319)|
| 1:28:41| has already had this idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5321)|
| 1:28:42| But I do think that a lot of the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5322)|
| 1:28:44| and fears would be alleviated with the easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5324)|
| 1:28:47| through the parking lot and the access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5327)|
| 1:28:49| So, that being said, I want to make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5329)|
| 1:28:54| to approve as recommended by staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5334)|
| 1:28:58| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5338)|
| 1:28:59| Sir, right now, this is-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5339)|
| 1:29:01| May I have just less than a minute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5341)|
| 1:29:02| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5342)|
| 1:29:03| 30 seconds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5343)|
| 1:29:04| Not right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5344)|
| 1:29:05| We have a motion and a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5345)|
| 1:29:07| and further discussion among commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5347)|
| 1:29:10| Commissioner Scott Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5350)|
| 1:29:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5355)|
| 1:29:16| First, I'd like to say that, to the members of the church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5356)|
| 1:29:20| I know your church well, and numerous family members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5360)|
| 1:29:23| that have been to the church there all their lives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5363)|
| 1:29:26| and some no longer with us, but, so, great church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5366)|
| 1:29:30| And I understand this is disturbing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5370)|
| 1:29:34| We, as commissioners, we're directed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5374)|
| 1:29:37| to try to balance out the needs of neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5377)|
| 1:29:42| with property owners, so that we don't favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5382)|
| 1:29:46| one over the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5386)|
| 1:29:47| And, like, in this case, you know, we have directives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5387)|
| 1:29:52| The Planning Commission, in the exercise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5392)|
| 1:29:54| of its administrative judgment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5394)|
| 1:29:55| should be guided by adopted plans policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5395)|
| 1:29:58| including the general plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5398)|
| 1:30:00| and the following general standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5400)|
| 1:30:02| And it goes on that the zoning, the use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5402)|
| 1:30:06| is consistent, and we can't take the access away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5406)|
| 1:30:11| I mean, we can't do that, legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5411)|
| 1:30:14| If we did, we would go to court, and we would lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5414)|
| 1:30:17| So, you know, I know that it's hard to accept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5417)|
| 1:30:23| but I think, you know, in a way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5423)|
| 1:30:26| this is gonna be a better situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5426)|
| 1:30:28| than there has been there in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5428)|
| 1:30:32| Access is the only access to this property that's there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5432)|
| 1:30:37| And maybe you guys can talk and work something better out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5437)|
| 1:30:43| but I don't see a way to deny this, myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5443)|
| 1:30:47| And I'm sympathetic to your concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5447)|
| 1:30:52| Anyway, I just, you know, I appreciate you guys being here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5452)|
| 1:30:55| and I know this is hard, but I think we would be hard-pressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5455)|
| 1:31:00| to deny this applicant on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5460)|
| 1:31:04| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5464)|
| 1:31:05| Chair recognizes Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5465)|
| 1:31:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5468)|
| 1:31:13| I guess this is for the attorneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5473)|
| 1:31:17| Why not Dean Hill Drive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5477)|
| 1:31:23| Commissioner, who are you directing your question to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5483)|
| 1:31:25| Why not access off Dean Hill Drive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5485)|
| 1:31:29| You said you wanted that, but you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5489)|
| 1:31:34| Richard, the church owns all that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5494)|
| 1:31:37| and every ingress and egress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5497)|
| 1:31:40| is surrounded by church property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5500)|
| 1:31:43| And I wanna make one comment or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5503)|
| 1:31:46| The current Harper Car Wash that's being under construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5506)|
| 1:31:51| on Alcoa Highway at Pellissippi Parkway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5511)|
| 1:31:56| is on a four-lane divided highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5516)|
| 1:32:01| at the junction of Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5521)|
| 1:32:05| And the second comment I wanna make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5525)|
| 1:32:08| it's not only the corner of Dean Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5528)|
| 1:32:10| but more traffic will impact at Old Wise Garber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5530)|
| 1:32:15| Kingston Pike, and the congestion that's being faced now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5535)|
| 1:32:21| at North Shore and Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5541)|
| 1:32:25| This is not a fit for this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5545)|
| 1:32:28| I've been involved in sparring this property for 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5548)|
| 1:32:32| We've already heard these comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5552)|
| 1:32:33| and right now the commission's in deliberations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5553)|
| 1:32:36| No, there's no further discussion right now, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5556)|
| 1:32:39| Answer some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5559)|
| 1:32:40| No, unless the question is directed to you, no, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5560)|
| 1:32:45| So, Commissioner Graf, do you have any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5565)|
| 1:32:48| I would think that two reasonable people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5568)|
| 1:32:52| or two reasonable groups, could agree on this car wash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5572)|
| 1:32:58| I mean, just, if the church owns that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5578)|
| 1:33:04| why can't they give them access across there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5584)|
| 1:33:08| if they don't want them coming on Anderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5588)|
| 1:33:13| And I understand the church's concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5593)|
| 1:33:21| I've seen that, and they have a real concern there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5601)|
| 1:33:27| But I also think that reasonable people can make this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5607)|
| 1:33:36| Just as the attorney said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5616)|
| 1:33:40| their main hours are when the church is not really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5620)|
| 1:33:47| as busy as when they have the preschoolers there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5627)|
| 1:33:51| So, I know we have a motion on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5631)|
| 1:33:56| but my gosh, I would think that the two of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5636)|
| 1:34:01| could get together and work something out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5641)|
| 1:34:04| And what I don't like is, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5644)|
| 1:34:07| you vote on it now, we'll work on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5647)|
| 1:34:10| No, I think we need to know what you're agreeing to mutually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5650)|
| 1:34:18| That would be my suggestion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5658)|
| 1:34:21| that probably we put this off for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5661)|
| 1:34:26| Let them get together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5666)|
| 1:34:27| If they can't do it, somebody's gonna lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5667)|
| 1:34:31| And that would be a shame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5671)|
| 1:34:34| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5674)|
| 1:34:35| That's why I asked for a 30-day postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5675)|
| 1:34:37| so that we could continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5677)|
| 1:34:39| Chair recognizes Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5679)|
| 1:34:43| I have a question about, if this passes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5683)|
| 1:34:47| how a crosswalk would be approached?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5687)|
| 1:34:50| Because there isn't one there right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5690)|
| 1:34:52| And if it's a public right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5692)|
| 1:34:55| I guess, why isn't there a crosswalk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5695)|
| 1:34:58| This is really for planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5698)|
| 1:35:00| so I can understand how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5700)|
| 1:35:04| That would be for City Engineering to comment on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5704)|
| 1:35:07| Yes, I'll defer to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5707)|
| 1:35:10| Sure, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5710)|
| 1:35:12| Generally speaking, in instances like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5712)|
| 1:35:16| if someone has a use, yeah, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5716)|
| 1:35:20| Generally speaking, if someone has a use like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5720)|
| 1:35:22| and has parking across a public street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5722)|
| 1:35:25| normally the folks that are utilizing that crossing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5725)|
| 1:35:29| typically would approach the city and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5729)|
| 1:35:31| hey, we'd like to install a crosswalk or something like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5731)|
| 1:35:34| to help better define a crossing area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5734)|
| 1:35:38| There's a lot of instances all over the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5738)|
| 1:35:41| and a lot of public right-of-way, a lot of miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5741)|
| 1:35:43| There's a lot of areas that folks could potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5743)|
| 1:35:47| install a crosswalk, assuming that they work with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5747)|
| 1:35:51| to make sure that it's appropriate and a safe location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5751)|
| 1:35:56| So in this instance, the onus for doing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5756)|
| 1:35:58| would be on the church as the party that is concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5758)|
| 1:36:01| about the person's passing back and forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5761)|
| 1:36:05| between the parking lot and the church?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5765)|
| 1:36:09| Normally, that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5769)|
| 1:36:11| Sometimes the city will evaluate it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5771)|
| 1:36:13| and determine if it's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5773)|
| 1:36:14| that the city would implement or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5774)|
| 1:36:17| It's not always the case that the city would implement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5777)|
| 1:36:20| a crossing, especially if it's only for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5780)|
| 1:36:23| essentially private use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5783)|
| 1:36:25| But those are evaluated on a case-by-case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5785)|
| 1:36:32| Chair recognizes Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5792)|
| 1:36:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5796)|
| 1:36:37| I appreciate the comments of all the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5797)|
| 1:36:40| I agree, like Commissioner Higgins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5800)|
| 1:36:41| that I do hope that if approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5801)|
| 1:36:44| that the church can work with Harper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5804)|
| 1:36:47| to come up with an easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5807)|
| 1:36:49| an agreement on the easement to access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5809)|
| 1:36:51| But I feel like this case is really about a special,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5811)|
| 1:36:54| this is a special use case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5814)|
| 1:36:56| And so in trying to make the decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5816)|
| 1:36:58| I actually looked at what would be permitted by right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5818)|
| 1:37:02| if Harper was to develop this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5822)|
| 1:37:04| And I actually found that, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5824)|
| 1:37:06| many of the uses of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5826)|
| 1:37:10| would be equally as disruptive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5830)|
| 1:37:12| or more disruptive than the car wash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5832)|
| 1:37:14| And I want to give you an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5834)|
| 1:37:15| Some of them are amusement, an indoor amusement facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5835)|
| 1:37:20| dwellings, both multifamily townhomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5840)|
| 1:37:24| eating and drinking establishments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5844)|
| 1:37:26| a food truck park, a halfway house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5846)|
| 1:37:29| a microbrewery in back of a Baptist church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5849)|
| 1:37:33| as well as retail liquor store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5853)|
| 1:37:36| I think that I'm glad to see that a local business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5856)|
| 1:37:40| is going to take ownership of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5860)|
| 1:37:43| And I would say that a lot of your members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5863)|
| 1:37:48| probably bought a Harper car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5868)|
| 1:37:50| have access to Shannon Harper and can talk to him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5870)|
| 1:37:53| if there's an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5873)|
| 1:37:54| And I'm planning on supporting this special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5874)|
| 1:37:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5878)|
| 1:37:59| Chair recognizes Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5879)|
| 1:38:01| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5881)|
| 1:38:02| And this is a question for city engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5882)|
| 1:38:05| So can you tell me exactly where Anderson Drive ends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5885)|
| 1:38:10| that is a city street on that map?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5890)|
| 1:38:14| I think probably the best approximation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5894)|
| 1:38:18| would be the ward map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5898)|
| 1:38:20| If we could go to the ward map layer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5900)|
| 1:38:23| And if I remember correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5903)|
| 1:38:24| it's very close to where that yellow line crosses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5904)|
| 1:38:30| So the ward map ends there at that same yellow line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5910)|
| 1:38:33| So that's a pretty good approximation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5913)|
| 1:38:35| without a survey in hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5915)|
| 1:38:37| Okay, so if we could for a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5917)|
| 1:38:39| go back over to the map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5919)|
| 1:38:42| that shows the potential new addition of that road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5922)|
| 1:38:46| as well as the parking lot and the car wash layout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5926)|
| 1:38:50| So everything from where it turns from white to gray,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5930)|
| 1:38:55| that is the end of the current Anderson Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5935)|
| 1:38:58| that is a public city street, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5938)|
| 1:39:01| So if this is being extended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5941)|
| 1:39:05| and there's concern about the church parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5945)|
| 1:39:09| not giving easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5949)|
| 1:39:10| why is there access into the church parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5950)|
| 1:39:12| off of the new Anderson Drive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5952)|
| 1:39:17| That's, Mr. Forrester, I'm looking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5957)|
| 1:39:21| if you can help me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5961)|
| 1:39:22| is that actually gonna be open into the church parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5962)|
| 1:39:25| right there on the far left side of the screen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5965)|
| 1:39:27| It looks like you can still access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5967)|
| 1:39:30| the parking lot right in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5970)|
| 1:39:32| You're talking about to the north?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5972)|
| 1:39:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5973)|
| 1:39:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5974)|
| 1:39:35| Again, that was what I was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5975)|
| 1:39:37| The landscape guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5977)|
| 1:39:39| require that to be fenced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5979)|
| 1:39:41| If we can get relief from that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5981)|
| 1:39:43| as I was responding to Commissioner Boyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5983)|
| 1:39:46| yes, that driveway there that's currently there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5986)|
| 1:39:49| would stay open and alleviate right turns towards Dean Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5989)|
| 1:39:53| Okay, so let me ask you this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5993)|
| 1:39:55| And I'm asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5995)|
| 1:39:57| if the church agrees that that can stay open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=5997)|
| 1:40:01| can you not, from where the exit is over here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6001)|
| 1:40:04| not add that extension of Anderson Drive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6004)|
| 1:40:07| So there's no way they can exit onto Anderson Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6007)|
| 1:40:10| They would have to exit only through the church parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6010)|
| 1:40:14| If we could get the easement to Dean Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6014)|
| 1:40:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6016)|
| 1:40:17| Certainly, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6017)|
| 1:40:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6018)|
| 1:40:19| And we've offered to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6019)|
| 1:40:20| if we could get that easement worked out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6020)|
| 1:40:22| we would support their efforts and requests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6022)|
| 1:40:25| in closing Anderson Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6025)|
| 1:40:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6027)|
| 1:40:28| No, you cannot for just one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6028)|
| 1:40:32| Is the pastor here for the church?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6032)|
| 1:40:36| Can I speak with you for a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6036)|
| 1:40:39| I know you've not spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6039)|
| 1:40:41| Is the, would the church be opposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6041)|
| 1:40:44| to access through that parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6044)|
| 1:40:46| as long as the applicant does not extend Anderson Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6046)|
| 1:40:49| to the car wash?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6049)|
| 1:40:51| Everything enters and exits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6051)|
| 1:40:53| through the easement of the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6053)|
| 1:40:56| We, my name is Wade Bibb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6056)|
| 1:40:58| 6108 Shannon Valley Farms Boulevard, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6058)|
| 1:41:03| We would be open to negotiating use of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6063)|
| 1:41:07| My understanding is they need to own that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6067)|
| 1:41:10| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6070)|
| 1:41:11| They would need to own that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6071)|
| 1:41:12| to be able to put a sign on Dean Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6072)|
| 1:41:16| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6076)|
| 1:41:17| Not just have easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6077)|
| 1:41:19| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6079)|
| 1:41:21| I believe that's something we learned along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6081)|
| 1:41:25| So I can tell you as senior pastor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6085)|
| 1:41:28| if you would give us a 30 day postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6088)|
| 1:41:31| we would in good faith negotiate some kind of agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6091)|
| 1:41:35| to make this a win-win| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6095)|
| 1:41:39| and save you a very difficult decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6099)|
| 1:41:45| Mr. Shannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6105)|
| 1:41:50| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6110)|
| 1:41:51| Mr. Harper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6111)|
| 1:41:52| Sorry, my brain is fried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6112)|
| 1:41:58| Which Harper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6118)|
| 1:41:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6119)|
| 1:42:00| Are you in agreement that you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6120)|
| 1:42:02| in good faith with the pastor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6122)|
| 1:42:04| work on fixing the easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6124)|
| 1:42:06| and working out in the next 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6126)|
| 1:42:09| if there's purchase that needs to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6129)|
| 1:42:11| so that you can do a sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6131)|
| 1:42:13| I'm just looking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6133)|
| 1:42:15| is there some sort of common ground we can all come to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6135)|
| 1:42:18| so that everybody's needs are met,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6138)|
| 1:42:21| but then you all are able to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6141)|
| 1:42:22| what you're wanting to do with the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6142)|
| 1:42:25| I feel like we've been acting in good faith since May of 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6145)|
| 1:42:29| We've met with the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6149)|
| 1:42:31| I offered to meet in front of the entire congregation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6151)|
| 1:42:36| to show them our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6156)|
| 1:42:37| We were denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6157)|
| 1:42:38| So we've been acting in good faith to have this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6158)|
| 1:42:41| We've made multiple PowerPoint presentations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6161)|
| 1:42:45| We initially had a conversation with Mr. Jones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6165)|
| 1:42:48| and Mr. Schmider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6168)|
| 1:42:50| where this closure of Anderson Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6170)|
| 1:42:53| and the access easement was first proposed by the church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6173)|
| 1:42:57| to which we accepted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6177)|
| 1:42:58| So I feel like we've been operating in good faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6178)|
| 1:43:02| I don't feel like a postponement at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6182)|
| 1:43:04| would be necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6184)|
| 1:43:04| because we've been working on this for six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6184)|
| 1:43:07| This is not new information to anybody at the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6187)|
| 1:43:11| Okay, and I hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6191)|
| 1:43:13| So pastor, I would ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6193)|
| 1:43:16| based on the fact that he did offer to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6196)|
| 1:43:18| before the church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6198)|
| 1:43:19| I'm just looking for why it was denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6199)|
| 1:43:21| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6201)|
| 1:43:22| We had our administrator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6202)|
| 1:43:23| and we had a representative from our trustees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6203)|
| 1:43:26| who were negotiating this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6206)|
| 1:43:28| And quite frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6208)|
| 1:43:29| we didn't think the city would approve 500 cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6209)|
| 1:43:31| coming in and out of an alleyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6211)|
| 1:43:37| In my opinion, it kind of answers it, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6217)|
| 1:43:39| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6219)|
| 1:43:40| I think the church's effort was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6220)|
| 1:43:43| let's try to kill this and it goes away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6223)|
| 1:43:45| And as you've heard from the commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6225)|
| 1:43:49| that property is going to get utilized at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6229)|
| 1:43:52| And I've talked to the people there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6232)|
| 1:43:54| like we didn't even know it was even there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6234)|
| 1:43:56| We didn't know it was even zoned industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6236)|
| 1:43:58| If we'd have known it was industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6238)|
| 1:44:00| we might have approached the owner about buying it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6240)|
| 1:44:02| and using it for that purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6242)|
| 1:44:04| So it's going to get utilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6244)|
| 1:44:06| And I wish you all would have sat down on both parties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6246)|
| 1:44:10| and discussed the access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6250)|
| 1:44:12| because I'm not seeing a good way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6252)|
| 1:44:14| that we can deny this particular project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6254)|
| 1:44:17| I mean, we can sit here all night and discuss this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6257)|
| 1:44:20| but we've got a motion and a second on the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6260)|
| 1:44:22| to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6262)|
| 1:44:24| We don't have a motion to postpone it for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6264)|
| 1:44:27| So I think we're going to have to hear the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6267)|
| 1:44:29| and the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6269)|
| 1:44:31| But at this point, I'm going to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6271)|
| 1:44:32| and allow others to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6272)|
| 1:44:35| because we've still got multiple lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6275)|
| 1:44:37| And Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6277)|
| 1:44:41| Thank you, Chair Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6281)|
| 1:44:44| I think most of us agree with exactly what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6284)|
| 1:44:49| We can't find a reason to deny it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6289)|
| 1:44:52| based on the guidelines that we're given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6292)|
| 1:44:56| And we're given criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6296)|
| 1:44:58| development standards for special uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6298)|
| 1:45:02| And I go through those six, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6302)|
| 1:45:04| thresholds, if you will, or standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6304)|
| 1:45:08| and it meets all the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6308)|
| 1:45:10| And I will assure you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6310)|
| 1:45:13| I raised two kids in this church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6313)|
| 1:45:15| and I love this church and all that they stand for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6315)|
| 1:45:18| And every comment that I make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6318)|
| 1:45:20| is not to upset the congregation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6320)|
| 1:45:23| but it's out of genuine concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6323)|
| 1:45:28| for how you use the church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6328)|
| 1:45:29| and for the children of the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6329)|
| 1:45:32| And one thing that I would encourage you to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6332)|
| 1:45:35| even if they close off the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6335)|
| 1:45:39| as I see the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6339)|
| 1:45:41| I looked at all the things I didn't see when I sat there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6341)|
| 1:45:44| and I went there for 20 plus years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6344)|
| 1:45:47| and I never paid attention as to some of the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6347)|
| 1:45:51| I guess, challenges about the way it's used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6351)|
| 1:45:55| One, it's very unusual that a childcare or aftercare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6355)|
| 1:46:01| that their parking be positioned across a public right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6361)|
| 1:46:06| That's unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6366)|
| 1:46:08| And I'm with you, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6368)|
| 1:46:11| This is tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6371)|
| 1:46:11| This is tough stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6371)|
| 1:46:12| because I don't want to disagree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6372)|
| 1:46:16| with Central Baptist Church on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6376)|
| 1:46:18| But I think sometimes you have to look within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6378)|
| 1:46:23| and say, why can't we do sidewalks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6383)|
| 1:46:27| Why can't we define a crosswalk or crosswalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6387)|
| 1:46:30| crosswalk signage, potential speed humps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6390)|
| 1:46:35| supervised crossings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6395)|
| 1:46:37| I see that, I think it's on the neighbor's driveway there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6397)|
| 1:46:43| There is one speed strip there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6403)|
| 1:46:46| Maybe you do speed humps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6406)|
| 1:46:48| These are unusual parking lots too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6408)|
| 1:46:50| in the sense that your parking stalls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6410)|
| 1:46:55| back out to public right of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6415)|
| 1:46:59| I think in today's standards, you can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6419)|
| 1:47:03| It does it on Henry Childs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6423)|
| 1:47:06| If you see the parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6426)|
| 1:47:08| it backs into the public right of way there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6428)|
| 1:47:11| That's not standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6431)|
| 1:47:13| So we've got some unusual substandard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6433)|
| 1:47:17| set of circumstances here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6437)|
| 1:47:19| And there is a, what's called,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6439)|
| 1:47:22| and I know Mr. King is familiar with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6442)|
| 1:47:25| a duty of care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6445)|
| 1:47:26| And if something happened to a child crossing that street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6446)|
| 1:47:30| somebody's going to bring up these very things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6450)|
| 1:47:33| that I just described about crosswalks, sidewalks, accesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6453)|
| 1:47:39| And it's somewhat unusual to have that many curb accesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6459)|
| 1:47:43| on that parking lot across Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6463)|
| 1:47:47| So you've got traffic going in so many directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6467)|
| 1:47:51| I mean, it's like a Frogger game at times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6471)|
| 1:47:55| to get through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6475)|
| 1:47:56| And probably the most challenging time to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6476)|
| 1:47:59| is probably 8.30 to 12 on Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6479)|
| 1:48:03| Because everybody's going every direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6483)|
| 1:48:05| I went there this morning at 8.30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6485)|
| 1:48:06| because I wanted to see how the early drop off went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6486)|
| 1:48:10| And I about scared the girl's purse out of her hands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6490)|
| 1:48:13| because she was digging in her purse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6493)|
| 1:48:15| walking out of that parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6495)|
| 1:48:16| crossing Anderson and never looked up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6496)|
| 1:48:19| So I think to better define how you get across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6499)|
| 1:48:24| is something that should be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6504)|
| 1:48:26| I'm not telling you how to run your business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6506)|
| 1:48:28| but someday if something happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6508)|
| 1:48:30| somebody's going to bring those very things up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6510)|
| 1:48:32| So I'm all for the kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6512)|
| 1:48:35| I'm all for the childcare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6515)|
| 1:48:38| I can't find a reason out of those six standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6518)|
| 1:48:41| to deny this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6521)|
| 1:48:42| And I believe that if we approve this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6522)|
| 1:48:45| I'm hopeful that the two parties will get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6525)|
| 1:48:48| and work it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6528)|
| 1:48:49| I know these are reasonable folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6529)|
| 1:48:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6531)|

| 1:48:54| Chair recognizes Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6534)|
| 1:48:56| A question for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6536)|
| 1:48:59| You guys own the property already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6539)|
| 1:49:04| No, it's under contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6544)|
| 1:49:05| It's under contract, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6545)|
| 1:49:06| The second point that I feel like I'm trying to get home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6546)|
| 1:49:11| is that I don't, I think that moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6551)|
| 1:49:15| with this approval is going to create the situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6555)|
| 1:49:20| to get this thing fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6560)|
| 1:49:21| But I think, I just, I feel like it's kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6561)|
| 1:49:25| getting drug out and nothing's been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6565)|
| 1:49:27| This has been going on a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6567)|
| 1:49:29| Is it, do you prefer a Dean Hill access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6569)|
| 1:49:33| or do you prefer the existing Anderson Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6573)|
| 1:49:37| We've always preferred the Dean Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6577)|
| 1:49:37| Yeah, so that's completely in the church's control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6577)|
| 1:49:40| I know you, I mean, you know real estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6580)|
| 1:49:43| You would prefer to be, to work with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6583)|
| 1:49:48| and work out something where it could improve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6588)|
| 1:49:50| their situation, improve their parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6590)|
| 1:49:52| and you could have better access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6592)|
| 1:49:54| And I think if we get this approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6594)|
| 1:49:56| that situation's gonna fix itself pretty quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6596)|
| 1:50:00| Chair recognizes Commissioner Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6600)|
| 1:50:02| Yeah, just real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6602)|
| 1:50:03| The reason I made the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6603)|
| 1:50:06| Several reasons, but you know, Mr. Harper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6606)|
| 1:50:10| could not get this thing rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6610)|
| 1:50:12| withdraw the motion for rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6612)|
| 1:50:14| build an industrial building back there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6614)|
| 1:50:16| and have a body shop back there or anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6616)|
| 1:50:21| Sounds like, you know, we all talk about postponements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6621)|
| 1:50:24| to get folks talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6624)|
| 1:50:25| They've been talking for six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6625)|
| 1:50:28| The fact that Anderson Drive stops where it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6628)|
| 1:50:31| with no ability to have a turnaround.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6631)|
| 1:50:34| And they have a clear, open line of communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6634)|
| 1:50:38| with a business owner that's still willing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6638)|
| 1:50:41| to allow them on his property and have access to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6641)|
| 1:50:44| to keep things open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6644)|
| 1:50:46| I mean, I think there's some unfortunate circumstances here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6646)|
| 1:50:51| that Mr. Harper's being looked at in a bad light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6651)|
| 1:50:54| to try to solve some issues that aren't his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6654)|
| 1:50:57| And I'm glad that they're still communicating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6657)|
| 1:51:00| I hope that they continue to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6660)|
| 1:51:02| And I'd like to call for a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6662)|
| 1:51:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6665)|

| 1:52:51| I'd like to hear the opposition please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6771)|
| 1:52:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6772)|
| 1:52:53| Opposition, come up to the podium please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6773)|

| 1:52:57| and you have five minutes for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6777)|
| 1:53:01| Thank you, Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6781)|

| 1:53:08| I'm also the vice president of Oakdale HOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6788)|
| 1:53:14| We don't oppose to the going from 46 beds to 66 beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6794)|
| 1:53:20| We don't have an issue with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6800)|
| 1:53:21| even though we have had some issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6801)|
| 1:53:23| with Helen Ross McNabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6803)|
| 1:53:26| We do oppose to cutting off our entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6806)|
| 1:53:29| to our subdivision and sharing it with Helen Ross McNabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6809)|
| 1:53:35| We have one entrance, one exit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6815)|
| 1:53:36| That is the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6816)|
| 1:53:38| They also have the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6818)|
| 1:53:39| We just ask that they use their entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6819)|
| 1:53:41| and exit and leave ours alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6821)|
| 1:53:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6826)|
| 1:53:52| Mr. Mullins, name and address please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6832)|
| 1:53:54| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street, suite 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6834)|
| 1:53:57| Here for the applicant Helen Ross McNabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6837)|
| 1:54:00| Appreciate the opposition's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6840)|
| 1:54:02| I wasn't aware of any opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6842)|
| 1:54:03| or what the concerns were until I guess yesterday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6843)|
| 1:54:06| I was aware someone signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6846)|
| 1:54:10| Helen Ross McNabb has been in this location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6850)|
| 1:54:13| for over 25 years, since 1997.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6853)|
| 1:54:16| And throughout the years it's expanded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6856)|
| 1:54:18| initially from 30 beds to 46.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6858)|
| 1:54:20| In January we got approval from 46 to 61.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6860)|
| 1:54:25| And then at the request of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6865)|
| 1:54:27| they freed up some additional funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6867)|
| 1:54:30| in hopes to address the growing overdose death problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6870)|
| 1:54:33| in the county to try to expand this facility further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6873)|
| 1:54:36| So we came back and filed this new application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6876)|
| 1:54:39| to go from the 61 that was approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6879)|
| 1:54:42| in January of this year to 66 beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6882)|
| 1:54:48| So the overall change in what we proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6888)|
| 1:54:52| and what was approved in January is not very different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6892)|
| 1:54:55| It's only five additional beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6895)|
| 1:54:57| There's some reorganization of the parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6897)|
| 1:55:01| and of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6901)|
| 1:55:02| And at the, I believe the city's suggestion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6902)|
| 1:55:05| they wanted to have a secondary access to the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6905)|
| 1:55:08| onto Oakback Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6908)|
| 1:55:13| And I believe that's what the opposition is concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6913)|
| 1:55:17| That entrance right there, you can see it has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6917)|
| 1:55:23| it's not adjacent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6923)|
| 1:55:25| It's in the middle of the property line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6925)|
| 1:55:27| there along Oakback Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6927)|
| 1:55:29| And that access is gonna be only for service vehicles only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6929)|
| 1:55:32| It's gonna have a gated access on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6932)|
| 1:55:35| It's only be for like fire emergency access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6935)|
| 1:55:37| or delivery vehicles only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6937)|
| 1:55:39| The primary access is still going to be the access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6939)|
| 1:55:43| on the front as it has been for 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6943)|
| 1:55:46| So that was something that was worked out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211110?start=6946)|
