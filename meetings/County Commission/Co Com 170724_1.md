| 2:41:14| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9674)|
| 2:41:17| Clerk, we're turning the page to a zoning appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9677)|
| 2:41:21| 6-G-17-RC is appealed by H.E. Biddle, third applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9681)|
| 2:41:27| Of MPC's decision to deny resounding from PR plan residential at one to two dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9687)|
| 2:41:34| to PR plan residential at a density up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9694)|
| 2:41:39| Property located southeast side of Hardin Valley Road, southeast of Steel Road in the 6th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9699)|
| 2:41:46| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9706)|
| 2:41:48| Mr. Chairman, members of the commission, I'm Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue, Knoxville 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9708)|
| 2:41:56| I'm here on behalf of the applicant who is also present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9716)|
| 2:42:00| Mr. Biddle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9720)|
| 2:42:02| Mr. Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9722)|
| 2:42:05| Could I have words from you, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9725)|
| 2:42:08| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9728)|
| 2:42:10| The Planning Commission voted by a vote of nine to two, voted to recommend denial of the applicant's rezoning for up to five units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9730)|
| 2:42:20| and left it at the current PR at one to two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9740)|
| 2:42:25| In order to be able to go to the five units per acre, a sector plan amendment would be required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9745)|
| 2:42:32| That was denied, and that means that if you all wish to pursue this request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9752)|
| 2:42:39| you will need to apply for the sector plan amendment and refer it back to MPC for their action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9759)|
| 2:42:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9769)|
| 2:42:50| The denial was based on a number or a factor, the primary factor being the topographic situation dealing with the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9770)|
| 2:43:03| This is a very difficult piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9783)|
| 2:43:06| It is extremely steep and a good portion of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9786)|
| 2:43:10| When the property was zoned two units per acre, Mr. Biddle did submit and get a concept plan approved at two units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9790)|
| 2:43:19| and it preserved a good portion of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9799)|
| 2:43:22| I believe we would say he is in conformance with the hillside protection plan based on the plan that he has gotten approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9802)|
| 2:43:30| The request to go to five units per acre, however, we believe would necessitate additional grading on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9810)|
| 2:43:41| well beyond what is shown right now and would violate that plan, and we cannot support the change of the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9821)|
| 2:43:50| The MPC did not support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9830)|
| 2:43:54| Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9834)|
| 2:43:58| Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission, as Mr. Kelly stated, this is another piece of property in the rural residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9838)|
| 2:44:07| Mr. Biddle is requesting two things, that you refer this back to MPC and initiate a request for low-density residential for this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9847)|
| 2:44:20| which would be up to five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9860)|
| 2:44:24| Secondly, and this would be up to the MPC and then they would make a recommendation back to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9864)|
| 2:44:31| is to approve this at 3.8 dwelling units per acre rather than the five requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9871)|
| 2:44:38| As Mr. Kelly has stated, there are slope constraints on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9878)|
| 2:44:44| However, Mr. Biddle's concept plan for the one to two units per acre took those slope constraints into consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9884)|
| 2:44:55| and the concept plan was approved, I believe. Was it on consent, Mr. Kelly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9895)|
| 2:45:00| I don't know the answer to that. Probably so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9900)|
| 2:45:03| It was probably on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9903)|
| 2:45:05| Mr. Biddle wants to use essentially the same footprint if he can get the zoning up to 3.8 units per acre that was previously approved by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9905)|
| 2:45:19| That footprint would not encroach on the areas covered by the slope protection plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9919)|
| 2:45:28| The lots would be smaller, the houses perhaps a little smaller, but the footprint would be the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9928)|
| 2:45:36| There will be one minor adjustment to a road entrance into the property, but he feels he can do 116 units on this property with the 3.8 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9936)|
| 2:45:48| Now, if he encroaches on the slope when he files the concept plan, I don't think MPC staff will approve or recommend approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9948)|
| 2:46:01| and I don't think the planning commission would approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9961)|
| 2:46:04| But we're asking for the chance to increase the housing density on this property and not impair the slopes that exist on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9964)|
| 2:46:15| To do that, technically, you all have to initiate a request back to MPC for low-density residential for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9975)|
| 2:46:25| I think in your packet, if you will look towards the end, Mr. Biddle has shown conceptually, and I don't know what page it is, but it looks something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=9985)|
| 2:46:40| This is the plan at the top that MPC approved at the two units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10000)|
| 2:46:49| He is going to shrink the lots, but the footprint would be the same, so there would be no adverse impact on the slopes on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10009)|
| 2:47:04| Still be able to utilize it for housing for all the new citizens we have in Knox County, and that's the request here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10024)|
| 2:47:14| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10034)|
| 2:47:16| Hey, Mr. Kelly. Looking at that, well, I guess Arthur's first question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10036)|
| 2:47:21| So the concept plan on the top, does it go to the end of the property that shows the topography on the heat map?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10041)|
| 2:47:29| It's not a heat map, it's the topographical that has the pink and the red, the ridge lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10049)|
| 2:47:36| So does that concept plan cover that whole property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10056)|
| 2:47:41| Rusty Biddle, 10784 Hardin Valley Road, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10061)|
| 2:47:47| The concept plan that is approved, if you go to the end of that first street to the end of the cul-de-sac, there is slope down to the property line from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10067)|
| 2:47:55| So there is nowhere else to go as far as expanding the footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10075)|
| 2:48:01| I guess my question is, this map that we have here that's got the topography, right, does that concept plan take up that whole square or trapezoid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10081)|
| 2:48:10| I mean, honest in my opinion, the concept plan that's been approved, the slopes are being disturbed with the plan that's being approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10090)|
| 2:48:19| But we will be doing no additional grading whatsoever to the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10099)|
| 2:48:22| We are literally wanting to cut the lots down in size and keep the same exact concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10102)|
| 2:48:27| I understand we'll have to go back for concept plan again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10107)|
| 2:48:30| So let me ask Mr. Kelly, does operating on the same footprint, was that shown to the commission before they voted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10110)|
| 2:48:40| Was this concept plan presented to the commission as they voted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10120)|
| 2:48:45| Yes and no, in the sense that Mr. Biddle did say that he intended to use basically the same road layout that he had right now and just reduce the size of the lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10125)|
| 2:48:56| The lots that are approved right now are 50 to 60 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10136)|
| 2:49:01| If he goes from 60 lots to 114 lots, that would suggest that these lots are going to be approximately 30 feet in width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10141)|
| 2:49:09| And I don't know if he's proposing attached housing or not, but when you go to a width such as that, there's going to be significant issues with regard to siding the houses on each of these 30 foot wide lots, if that's the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10149)|
| 2:49:27| How does that work with setback, Mr. Biddle? I mean, 30 foot lots, I mean you're talking about...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10167)|
| 2:49:32| We're looking at two different options. I have two different builders interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10172)|
| 2:49:34| One is wanting to do attached, one is wanting to do detached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10174)|
| 2:49:38| To be honest, what's going to happen if we make these lots narrower going up the road, it allows us to lift the side and actually disturb less dirt, not more dirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10178)|
| 2:49:48| Because as the pads get narrower, you can cut them into the slope easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10188)|
| 2:49:53| So we actually have went back already and asked to steepen our road, which disturbs less ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10193)|
| 2:49:58| But what we are looking at is either attached or detached villas, or they could be attached condos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10198)|
| 2:50:03| Is there a comparable... I guess I'd ask you later to go look at somebody's work that's comparable to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10203)|
| 2:50:11| I grasp the same footprint. I don't understand the difference if you get three or two to an acre on the footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10211)|
| 2:50:22| You're disturbing, and that's what MPC is talking about, disturbance of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10222)|
| 2:50:26| So I don't fully grasp the not granting a little bit more, because you're not really into the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10226)|
| 2:50:38| They're doing what we ask, right? The developers...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10238)|
| 2:50:41| You've got the growth plan again in play here, so that's part of the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10241)|
| 2:50:47| Right, but I think we answered the growth plan question a couple of votes ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10247)|
| 2:50:50| And so the concept on the same footprint, you're disturbing less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10250)|
| 2:50:59| We're telling developers, don't disturb hilltop, ridge slope and ridgetop, and we'll let you condense a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10259)|
| 2:51:06| Now we're saying, well, don't let you condense a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10266)|
| 2:51:09| And so that's kind of my question, I guess, to MPC is, we're doing what you ask us to do as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10269)|
| 2:51:15| Put it on the flat part, if there is flat part to this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10275)|
| 2:51:20| Stay off the slopes, but we'll give you more housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10280)|
| 2:51:23| So now we're turning that down. So I guess my question is, why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10283)|
| 2:51:28| Commissioners, I think we're in a situation where the Planning Commission is in a position where until the state legislature either changes the growth plan law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10288)|
| 2:51:35| or a competent legal authority tells us that the growth plan is no longer a viable document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10295)|
| 2:51:43| I think the Planning Commission and the Planning Commission staff in particular would be responsible for trying to see to it that the plan is carried out as it's adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10303)|
| 2:51:54| But you're not, even at that, you're not even allowing up to three an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10314)|
| 2:52:01| Well, in this particular case, he's not adjoining or contiguous to the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10321)|
| 2:52:10| So two is the maximum that it would allow since he's not contiguous to the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10330)|
| 2:52:17| So anything not contiguous can only go to two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10337)|
| 2:52:20| That's correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10340)|
| 2:52:22| I thought the number was three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10342)|
| 2:52:24| If you're contiguous to the growth area, you can go to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10344)|
| 2:52:31| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10351)|
| 2:52:33| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10353)|
| 2:52:34| If we go down to a 30, did you say 30-foot wide lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10354)|
| 2:52:38| Again, we're conceptual at this point, but they could go down to 30-foot lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10358)|
| 2:52:42| I've got a builder that does a 27-foot product that would be four plexus condos, attached condos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10362)|
| 2:52:49| Well, this, I guess my question is, are we going to vote for something that you're going to have to go to BZA for some type of variances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10369)|
| 2:52:57| No, it would go back through concept plan through MPC once our concept plan is redone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10377)|
| 2:53:01| As long as the lot's a minimum of 25 feet wide, it would meet the requirements of the planned residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10381)|
| 2:53:08| We have attached products or attached dwellings that are approximately 25 feet wide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10388)|
| 2:53:16| and where the lot line goes down the common wall and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10396)|
| 2:53:20| But my understanding was that Mr. Biddle was talking about doing a detached product| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10400)|
| 2:53:27| and trying to balance the grading between the units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10407)|
| 2:53:31| We felt that that would be very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10411)|
| 2:53:33| But the primary factor here, again, is a growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10413)|
| 2:53:36| We like density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10416)|
| 2:53:38| From that standpoint, the idea of greater density is not, density unto itself is not the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10418)|
| 2:53:46| It's the fact that we're dealing with the growth plan and the slopes of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10426)|
| 2:53:51| I guess, did we answer, Mr. Daniels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10431)|
| 2:53:55| Dan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10435)|
| 2:53:57| Did we answer that question two votes ago or three votes ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10437)|
| 2:54:02| About the rural growth plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10442)|
| 2:54:06| Certainly with respect to the property that was before you on that vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10446)|
| 2:54:15| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10455)|
| 2:54:16| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10456)|
| 2:54:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10458)|
| 2:54:20| Mr. Kelly, I'm trying to remember from the June MPC meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10460)|
| 2:54:24| but was there not some kind of an issue with access to this property from Hardin Valley Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10464)|
| 2:54:30| and has that now been resolved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10470)|
| 2:54:32| To my knowledge, that's not an issue any longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10472)|
| 2:54:35| Mr. Biddle can probably answer that better than I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10475)|
| 2:54:38| There is no issue as to access?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10478)|
| 2:54:40| There, I think there was some land trading or something that went on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10480)|
| 2:54:43| that allowed him to improve his access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10483)|
| 2:54:46| My neighbor had originally agreed to let us grade, get a grading easement on him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10486)|
| 2:54:50| When it come time to get it, he denied us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10490)|
| 2:54:52| So, my engineer has now shifted the road over about five feet to get off of him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10492)|
| 2:54:59| It's no longer an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10499)|
| 2:55:01| Back to Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10501)|
| 2:55:03| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10503)|
| 2:55:05| I would like to point out to my fellow commissioners that I have been on this board for three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10505)|
| 2:55:10| and we have always went, I believe, by the hilltop slope protection guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10510)|
| 2:55:18| And I think that giving someone longitude, the latitude to see what would fit with a concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10518)|
| 2:55:26| has a direct bearing on the number of units that can be on a piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10526)|
| 2:55:30| The footprint size dictates the density and how much dirt will be disturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10530)|
| 2:55:35| Also, this piece of property is across from a section where we've invested almost $100 million in three schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10535)|
| 2:55:43| which the middle school will soon be opening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10543)|
| 2:55:48| I think part of the goal in planning is to have density around these kind of locations where schools are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10548)|
| 2:55:57| so students can walk and people can live within walking distance of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10557)|
| 2:56:01| I'm inclined to send this back to MPC with a recommendation for reconsidering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10561)|
| 2:56:09| to initiate a sector plan for LDR and let them go forward with this to see what they can yield with this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10569)|
| 2:56:20| Because a lot of times we get to this situation where we're already in the middle of a project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10580)|
| 2:56:25| and a lot of engineering hasn't been done to see what it can yield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10585)|
| 2:56:30| And we're at some point going to have to do a lot of work to roads in Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10590)|
| 2:56:37| and we need to make sure that we've built a tax base out there that can support developing the kind of roads that are going to be needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10597)|
| 2:56:45| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10605)|
| 2:56:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I spent some time out there yesterday walking the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10607)|
| 2:56:52| And to connect the dots to our work session, also, this property is from the top of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10612)|
| 2:56:59| You can actually see, if you all remember when the Development Corp was here and he was talking about the TIF on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10619)|
| 2:57:06| This almost overlooks over the high school. You can see the TIF on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10626)|
| 2:57:10| You can actually see, if you all remember when the Development Corp was here and he was talking about the TIF on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10630)|
| 2:57:15| This almost overlooks over the high school. You can see that property that the Development Corporation owns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10635)|
| 2:57:22| But just to help me understand it, I'm going to ask him really simple questions, because I was not around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10642)|
| 2:57:27| and some of us were not here on this body when we went through all the hilltop protection plan and all of that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10647)|
| 2:57:33| Now, looking from Hardin Valley Road, it's almost like a ski slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10653)|
| 2:57:37| It goes very much straight uphill. The property down at the road, that's not part of it, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10657)|
| 2:57:44| You've got an easement, or there's the road that turns in off of Hardin Valley, then it cuts through it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10664)|
| 2:57:49| and then you walk up that road where a lot of it's already been kind of cleared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10669)|
| 2:57:53| Can I help paint the picture for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10673)|
| 2:57:55| So that frontage property is commercial-owned, that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10675)|
| 2:57:58| This entrance goes in at the center of Steel Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10678)|
| 2:58:02| So the road you walked on, it was just a logging road that was cut in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10682)|
| 2:58:04| Okay, so that's not going to necessarily be the access road for the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10684)|
| 2:58:08| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10688)|
| 2:58:09| So what we're literally talking about is the top of the hill up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10689)|
| 2:58:13| and you had already had it approved for two before when you originally plotted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10693)|
| 2:58:19| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10699)|
| 2:58:20| And now kind of what we're talking about is increasing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10700)|
| 2:58:23| yet we're also going to try not to mess up the slopes there that are in the ridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10703)|
| 2:58:28| Is that kind of what, in layman's terms, we're trying to get to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10708)|
| 2:58:31| Basically, as we're going up that hill, we are cutting the road down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10711)|
| 2:58:35| to get a road flat enough to get up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10715)|
| 2:58:38| Once we get to the top, that dirt that's cut for the road will be filled into the lower areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10718)|
| 2:58:45| So the very tops do not have a lot of cut on them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10725)|
| 2:58:48| and I don't have the plans in front of me to be exact, but if that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10728)|
| 2:58:53| You mean the ridges on the hills on top are not going to be messed with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10733)|
| 2:58:57| Some of it's going to be cut, but not all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10737)|
| 2:58:59| We're not cutting it way down like you're thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10739)|
| 2:59:02| The road will go up at 14 percent, and once we hit the top, then it will flatten out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10742)|
| 2:59:07| So your plan, how is that road going to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10747)|
| 2:59:09| Because like I said, I was just on that access road over on the side that went up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10749)|
| 2:59:13| It goes straight through Steel Road and starts turning up sideways across the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10753)|
| 2:59:18| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10758)|
| 2:59:20| Similar to the upper portion of the road you walked on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10760)|
| 2:59:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10763)|
| 2:59:24| Where the road starts turning left, that's where our road will tie in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10764)|
| 2:59:27| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10767)|
| 2:59:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10769)|
| 2:59:32| Are there any other questions of the presenters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10772)|
| 2:59:37| Anyone else wishing to speak publicly of this question that is at hand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10777)|
| 2:59:45| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10785)|
| 2:59:48| I thought he made a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10788)|
| 2:59:50| Randy made a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10790)|
| 2:59:53| I thought you said make a motion to send it back, or did you say you're ...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10793)|
| 2:59:57| I was recommending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10797)|
| 3:00:00| Yeah, I struggle with this a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10800)|
| 3:00:03| I can't go up to the five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10803)|
| 3:00:05| I mean, I wouldn't touch this with a five or maybe not even a four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10805)|
| 3:00:09| But I would like for MPC to kind of, with a new concept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10809)|
| 3:00:14| and I don't know if it's legitimate to run those together at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10814)|
| 3:00:19| Is it, Dan, to run those concepts together at the same time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10819)|
| 3:00:23| I think the first thing that you need to do is initiate a sector plan amendment to low density roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10823)|
| 3:00:29| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10829)|
| 3:00:31| And that's not saying that I'm for the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10831)|
| 3:00:33| That's saying that I think it needs a second look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10833)|
| 3:00:35| That will allow you to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10835)|
| 3:00:37| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10837)|
| 3:00:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10839)|
| 3:00:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10841)|
| 3:00:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10843)|
| 3:00:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10845)|
| 3:00:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10847)|
| 3:00:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10849)|
| 3:00:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10851)|
| 3:00:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10853)|
| 3:00:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10855)|
| 3:00:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10857)|
| 3:00:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10859)|
| 3:01:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10860)|
| 3:01:01| I would like for you to consider between the two and the five units for acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10861)|
| 3:01:03| And frankly, 3.8 is the best we can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10863)|
| 3:01:07| And we'll further refine that because I'm sure MPC would like to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10867)|
| 3:01:12| after your motion passes, a general idea of what the new concept plan will look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10872)|
| 3:01:20| I'm not saying I'm for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10880)|
| 3:01:22| I'm just saying I think I'd like, we need to go there and review it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170724?start=10882)|
