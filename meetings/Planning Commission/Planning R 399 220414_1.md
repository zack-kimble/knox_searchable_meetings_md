| 2:34:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9270)|
| 2:34:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9271)|
| 2:34:32| You might as well stay up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9272)|
| 2:34:33| I think you've got the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9273)|
| 2:34:36| Next is agenda item number 27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9276)|
| 2:34:38| This is a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9278)|
| 2:34:40| File 4T22RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9280)|
| 2:34:42| Applicant is Terry Romans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9282)|
| 2:34:45| Location, south side of West Governor John Severe Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9285)|
| 2:34:48| east of South Point Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9288)|
| 2:34:50| Size of track, 4.84 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9290)|
| 2:34:53| Resident zoning is agricultural and rural general residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9293)|
| 2:34:57| Zoning requested planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9297)|
| 2:35:00| Density proposed up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9300)|
| 2:35:04| Staff recommendation approved PR planned residential up to five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9304)|
| 2:35:08| dwelling units per acre because it is consistent with the sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9308)|
| 2:35:12| plan subject to four conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9312)|
| 2:35:15| Mr. Roman, you're present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9315)|
| 2:35:17| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9317)|
| 2:35:19| I'm not seeing any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9319)|
| 2:35:21| Do you have any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9321)|
| 2:35:25| Just one comment on the 50-foot buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9325)|
| 2:35:30| Can we reduce that to an average of 50?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9330)|
| 2:35:33| Because the shape of the property kind of cuts into a lot of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9333)|
| 2:35:37| frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9337)|
| 2:35:38| If we've got 50 foot along the front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9338)|
| 2:35:40| just if we could reduce it to an average of 50,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9340)|
| 2:35:42| maybe no more than 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9342)|
| 2:35:45| Is that possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9345)|
| 2:35:52| Levin, you're the staff on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9352)|
| 2:35:56| You may not have an answer at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9356)|
| 2:35:59| That's understandable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9359)|
| 2:36:04| Yeah, so I think, I mean, I honestly think he brings up a fairly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9364)|
| 2:36:08| decent point in the sense there isn't a lot of depth on this lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9368)|
| 2:36:11| But I do think that the commission does need to decide the risks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9371)|
| 2:36:16| involved in creating a precedent if there is a reduction in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9376)|
| 2:36:21| 50-foot buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9381)|
| 2:36:24| I just want to voice that there is a bit of concern that other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9384)|
| 2:36:29| developers in the future might request the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9389)|
| 2:36:32| So just a couple of thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9392)|
| 2:36:37| Pat, because it's the same economy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9397)|
| 2:36:39| can we actually reduce it because this buffer is recommended by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9399)|
| 2:36:43| That's in the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9403)|
| 2:36:46| Well, it's part of the John Speer Highway Corridor plan that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9406)|
| 2:36:49| adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9409)|
| 2:36:51| It's a plan recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9411)|
| 2:36:53| It's not specifically a regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9413)|
| 2:36:59| But with the strange layout of this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9419)|
| 2:37:02| it does create somewhat of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9422)|
| 2:37:04| I mean, is that something we work out in the design process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9424)|
| 2:37:06| concept plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9426)|
| 2:37:08| I'm sorry, Mr. Roman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9428)|
| 2:37:09| Is that something that we would work through in the concept plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9429)|
| 2:37:13| I think we could, but I think it's how we state the motion today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9433)|
| 2:37:18| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9438)|
| 2:37:21| Yeah, we just have to make sure that if you want to have flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9441)|
| 2:37:24| during the use and review development plan stage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9444)|
| 2:37:26| that the condition is worded in such that it provides flexibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9446)|
| 2:37:30| because right now it doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9450)|
| 2:37:32| So if the condition was approved by county commission as written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9452)|
| 2:37:37| they would have a 50-foot buffer that they would have to maintain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9457)|
| 2:37:40| We wouldn't have flexibility to work with them at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9460)|
| 2:37:43| Well, I mean, there's flexibility in allowing access through that 50-foot buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9463)|
| 2:37:48| But, I mean, outside of that, we wouldn't have the authority to just average it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9468)|
| 2:37:54| Any suggestions on the flexibility statement in the report that we could use to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9474)|
| 2:38:04| I suggest no flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9484)|
| 2:38:06| Do what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9486)|
| 2:38:07| I suggest no flexibility on the 50-foot buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9487)|
| 2:38:10| I think that that's one of the reasons we have PR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9490)|
| 2:38:14| is to be able to then concentrate the density outside of where that 50-foot buffer is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9494)|
| 2:38:21| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9501)|
| 2:38:23| I'm on the flip side of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9503)|
| 2:38:25| I would have been in favor of removing or allowing flexibility on the buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9505)|
| 2:38:30| on the one northeast of it, and specifically on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9510)|
| 2:38:34| I mean, this looks like a hardship type situation based off the shape of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9514)|
| 2:38:40| So I think that it is something that in the city there's landscape buffers that are required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9520)|
| 2:38:47| in between certain properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9527)|
| 2:38:49| However, there is an opportunity for an alternative landscape plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9529)|
| 2:38:53| in which if you're unable to meet that, you can offer, show alternatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9533)|
| 2:38:59| maybe redistribute some of that landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9539)|
| 2:39:02| So I would think that in this situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9542)|
| 2:39:04| maybe something that would allow for an alternative to the buffer in the concept plan review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9544)|
| 2:39:11| would be beneficial because then we could look at something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9551)|
| 2:39:17| Maybe it's the same amount of trees and whatnot, but maybe distributed in a different way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9557)|
| 2:39:22| That's my thoughts on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9562)|
| 2:39:27| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9567)|
| 2:39:30| I thought I heard Director Brooks say that we had the flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9570)|
| 2:39:35| I didn't hear all of Mike's comments, but it sounded like maybe we didn't have the flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9575)|
| 2:39:42| Could we just clarify that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9582)|
| 2:39:46| The way that the condition is written right now, there's a required 50-foot buffer by the condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9586)|
| 2:39:54| so we wouldn't have the flexibility to average that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9594)|
| 2:39:58| or shift any of that buffer to different portions of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9598)|
| 2:40:01| We might make one portion of the buffer wider than 50 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9601)|
| 2:40:05| and reduce it in another spot the way the current condition is written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9605)|
| 2:40:10| The County Commission approves that condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9610)|
| 2:40:11| That's what the zoning condition is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9611)|
| 2:40:13| We can't change it unless they go back through the rezoning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9613)|
| 2:40:17| So if we want to provide flexibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9617)|
| 2:40:20| we need to add that flexibility into the condition today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9620)|
| 2:40:27| Cranston, you had your line on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9627)|
| 2:40:28| Do you want to make a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9628)|
| 2:40:30| I was just going to mention if Nick could measure 50 feet on the mapping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9630)|
| 2:40:34| just so the commissioners can have a bit of a good understanding of what that might look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9634)|
| 2:40:39| as far as the distance goes on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9639)|
| 2:41:09| Nick, would you mind measuring the end, both ends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9669)|
| 2:41:24| to kind of see how wide or how deep it is on both sides of the lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9684)|
| 2:41:29| Can you just do a 50-foot parallel line to the front property line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9689)|
| 2:41:39| I would also, while he's doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9699)|
| 2:41:41| point out that I don't know how wide the right-of-way on this is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9701)|
| 2:41:44| but there is a significant amount of green space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9704)|
| 2:41:47| between the highway and the property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9707)|
| 2:41:52| It's a pretty wide right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9712)|
| 2:41:56| Is this something that could be worded into a plan review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9716)|
| 2:42:25| It could be worded with flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9745)|
| 2:42:29| Will this require a concept?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9749)|
| 2:42:31| Yes, it will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9751)|
| 2:42:33| Is there some language that we could put in that would give us the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9753)|
| 2:42:37| to look at a reworking of the 50-foot buffer in that phase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9757)|
| 2:42:45| Could you use the term maintain generally a 50-foot tree buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9765)|
| 2:42:51| use the word generally, give you any flexibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9771)|
| 2:42:54| I caution on, if you want to put a condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9774)|
| 2:42:57| you can build in some flexibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9777)|
| 2:42:59| but we also need enough direction to be able to provide direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9779)|
| 2:43:03| at that next stage to the applicant, and they need it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9783)|
| 2:43:06| So it needs to be fairly clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9786)|
| 2:43:08| So if you want to average it across, that's one thing you can consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9788)|
| 2:43:20| Could this be appealed to BZA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9800)|
| 2:43:25| BZA could, once it's a condition of the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9805)|
| 2:43:29| it could be considered a hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9809)|
| 2:43:31| I just think if we start redoing our regs on the fly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9811)|
| 2:43:35| what criteria do we have to justify this in the future on other things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9815)|
| 2:43:39| I just think it's a bad idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9819)|
| 2:43:41| If it could go to BZA, I think that would be appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9821)|
| 2:43:44| because we're completely speculating on it right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9824)|
| 2:43:48| so whatever the layout is, it seems to need something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9828)|
| 2:43:54| I think that's pretty appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9834)|
| 2:43:57| Commissioner Sheltzer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=9837)|

| 2:49:52| You've got a lot of lots that are larger than an acre with one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10192)|

| 2:50:01| The next thing is in order to have a zoning ordinance like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10201)|
| 2:50:06| this, you have to meet all the conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10206)|

| 2:50:18| say, yes, you need imaginative solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10218)|
| 2:50:22| And that's kind of a magic word that came up, a magic term that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10222)|
| 2:50:26| came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10226)|
| 2:50:27| But the important part of this is a portion of this property is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10227)|
| 2:50:30| within the 100-year and 500-year flood plain of a tributary of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10230)|
| 2:50:35| Beaver Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10235)|
| 2:50:36| And so you can't develop five dwelling units per acre on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10236)|
| 2:50:41| entire 12.5 acres because you have a flood plain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10241)|
| 2:50:44| And so if you take the undevelopable property, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10244)|
| 2:50:48| don't know whether Miss Albertson can tell you how much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10248)|
| 2:50:50| that it is because it's not in the rezoning report, and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10250)|
| 2:50:53| take that away and you develop five dwelling units per acre on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10253)|
| 2:50:56| the developable property in this 12.5 acres, then you've got a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10256)|
| 2:51:00| windfall of density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10260)|

| 2:51:22| And I won't bore you with anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10282)|
| 2:51:25| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10285)|

| 2:51:37| My name is James Zenker, 1700 West Beaver Creek Drive, Powell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10297)|

| 2:51:43| I'm representing today three different community groups that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10303)|
| 2:51:46| are adjacent to the property in question, Temple Baptist Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10306)|
| 2:51:50| Crown College, and Temple Academies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10310)|
| 2:51:53| I'm representing today Temple Baptist Church, which has over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10313)|
| 2:51:56| 4,000 adult driving age members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10316)|
| 2:52:00| Three times a week we hold large meetings in our main auditorium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10320)|

| 2:52:06| And we also have 15 full-size school buses that operate each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10326)|
| 2:52:09| week for church ministry purposes in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10329)|
| 2:52:13| The approval of five units per acre would not be in keeping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10333)|
| 2:52:17| with our neighborhood, and it would also present a difficulty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10337)|
| 2:52:21| in the traffic area, traffic pattern in that area, and also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10341)|
| 2:52:24| safety issues in what is a very narrow and a very hilly, curvy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10344)|
| 2:52:30| and often flooded Beaver Creek Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10350)|
| 2:52:33| I'm also representing today Temple Academy, and I have with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10353)|
| 2:52:36| me Principal Kristin Buhr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10356)|
| 2:52:38| I'd like for her to stand, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10358)|
| 2:52:40| And she represents 395 enrolled students and their families that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10360)|
| 2:52:44| are traveling twice daily on West Beaver Creek Drive through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10364)|
| 2:52:48| this very area, and from four-year-old preschoolers to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10368)|
| 2:52:52| newly licensed 16-year-old drivers, all of the students are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10372)|
| 2:52:57| dropped off and picked up by personal vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10377)|
| 2:53:02| There are no bus services for the academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10382)|
| 2:53:04| And you may wonder what the connection is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10384)|
| 2:53:06| Well, this property is actually within the school safety zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10386)|
| 2:53:11| Less than 20 yards from the driveway that they proposed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10391)|
| 2:53:15| have all of these units entering and exiting, it is within less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10395)|
| 2:53:18| than 20 yards of our school safety zone, which is already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10398)|
| 2:53:21| very congested and often a very dangerous place for pedestrians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10401)|
| 2:53:25| and drivers as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10405)|
| 2:53:27| I also have representing Crown College Mr. Tim Tomlinson, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10407)|
| 2:53:31| Vice President of the college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10411)|
| 2:53:33| He is representing 500 enrolled students who travel twice daily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10413)|
| 2:53:36| to and from classes through this area and past the driveway that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10416)|
| 2:53:40| they would propose to have as the access point to Beaver Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10420)|
| 2:53:44| Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10424)|
| 2:53:46| Dormitories at 1700 West Beaver Creek are housing approximately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10426)|
| 2:53:50| 320 students who must travel to and from classes on this road in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10430)|
| 2:53:54| this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10434)|
| 2:53:56| And so we are not opposed to the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10436)|
| 2:53:59| We want to make that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10439)|
| 2:54:00| But we are opposed to the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10440)|
| 2:54:03| And we would request that the density be reduced from five units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10443)|
| 2:54:07| per acre to either two or two and a half units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10447)|
| 2:54:11| Being here throughout the afternoon and hearing many of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10451)|
| 2:54:15| five units per acre being approved, this is a unique case in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10455)|
| 2:54:18| sense that it is within a school safety zone with a 15 mile an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10458)|
| 2:54:23| hour limit during school hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10463)|
| 2:54:27| And so I would implore you on behalf of the three entities that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10467)|
| 2:54:31| represent today and on behalf of children and students who will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10471)|
| 2:54:35| using this area for the safety and sake of those children to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10475)|
| 2:54:38| reduce this to two and a half instead of five per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10478)|
| 2:54:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10481)|
| 2:54:42| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10482)|
| 2:54:43| Mr. Campbell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10483)|
| 2:54:52| It seems to me that this boils down to two issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10492)|
| 2:54:56| one being density and one being traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10496)|
| 2:55:00| Let's start with traffic first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10500)|
| 2:55:02| Beaver Creek is a well-traveled road and has connection between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10502)|
| 2:55:10| Clinton Highway and then eventually ends up at Central Avenue Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10510)|
| 2:55:16| And, yes, there are schools and Temple Baptist has done some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10516)|
| 2:55:19| wonderful things, Crown College has done some wonderful things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10519)|
| 2:55:22| and they continue to expand and do those good works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10522)|
| 2:55:26| And they have contributed to some of this traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10526)|
| 2:55:29| as most school zones contribute to traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10529)|
| 2:55:32| especially peak hour volume traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10532)|
| 2:55:35| We have developments that are high-density developments that occur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10535)|
| 2:55:38| simultaneously in those environments all over this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10538)|
| 2:55:43| Bricky McLeod, for instance, has got high-density developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10543)|
| 2:55:46| halls, and we can go through the other schools that do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10546)|
| 2:55:51| And I understand the safety value that needs to be placed when those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10551)|
| 2:55:56| two things are interacting, and we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10556)|
| 2:56:00| One of the things that is five units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10560)|
| 2:56:03| and they talk about it's not compatible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10563)|
| 2:56:07| and there are some developments here that are RA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10567)|
| 2:56:09| However, there are several developments down through here that are at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10569)|
| 2:56:14| much higher developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10574)|
| 2:56:15| I mean, we've designed probably three or four of those developments along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10575)|
| 2:56:19| Beaver Creek, one across from the current campus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10579)|
| 2:56:22| maybe two across from the current campus of Crown College.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10582)|
| 2:56:27| So you start looking at some of these developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10587)|
| 2:56:30| They are dense with the mixture that comes here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10590)|
| 2:56:34| The other thing that I might want to point out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10594)|
| 2:56:36| and something that kind of gets overlooked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10596)|
| 2:56:38| we were trying as best we could to be as straight up with what we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10598)|
| 2:56:41| going to do with the 12 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10601)|
| 2:56:44| We've got 40 acres on this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10604)|
| 2:56:47| and we could have easily come in here and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10607)|
| 2:56:49| yeah, we're going to develop this at three an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10609)|
| 2:56:51| and crammed everything down into the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10611)|
| 2:56:53| But we wanted you to know what our development potential was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10613)|
| 2:56:57| We actually front on a five-lane road to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10617)|
| 2:57:03| You know, a five-lane road at five units an acre doesn't seem to me to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10623)|
| 2:57:07| that big of a burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10627)|
| 2:57:09| We've got water and sewer access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10629)|
| 2:57:11| We've got some floodway flooding issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10631)|
| 2:57:14| However, it's my contention that since the new road is built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10634)|
| 2:57:18| some of that flood fringe may actually be removed from that because that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10638)|
| 2:57:23| road really acts as a dam with Beaver Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10643)|
| 2:57:27| And I know about the flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10647)|
| 2:57:28| The flooding actually occurs down the road closer to the railroad tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10648)|
| 2:57:33| But the majority of this traffic would probably be headed back to where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10653)|
| 2:57:37| new roundabout is and back towards Clinton Highway and Powell area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10657)|
| 2:57:42| So, again, I appreciate their concerns and understand that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10662)|
| 2:57:47| we want to make sure our communities are developed in a good way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10667)|
| 2:57:52| But I would also submit that we've got 62 units proposed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10672)|
| 2:57:59| We've not proposed 200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10679)|
| 2:58:02| Sixty-two units is not going to negatively impact traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10682)|
| 2:58:06| And even if it's a lower density, and I think the letter I saw said two and a half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10686)|
| 2:58:10| then we're talking about a difference of 30 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10690)|
| 2:58:13| And 30-unit delta is not going to take traffic into a negative situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10693)|
| 2:58:18| So we would just ask you approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10698)|
| 2:58:20| And, again, we appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10700)|
| 2:58:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10703)|
| 2:58:25| Chair recognizes Commissioner Uden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10705)|
| 2:58:28| Yeah, I can't see where staff missed this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10708)|
| 2:58:33| This is right down the street from Powell High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10713)|
| 2:58:38| and a lot of density and things getting developed up and down Beaver Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10718)|
| 2:58:43| I think the applicant is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10723)|
| 2:58:45| He didn't try to push it to redevelop and rezone more property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10725)|
| 2:58:50| I appreciate the church and the school saying that they're concerned about traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10730)|
| 2:58:56| getting to their school, but these are county roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10736)|
| 2:58:58| I don't see Knox County Schools coming down here saying that they don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10738)|
| 2:59:02| development because the kids get to their school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10742)|
| 2:59:04| So I would hope that Crown College and those folks would go after these kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10744)|
| 2:59:08| instead of not try to have them across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10748)|
| 2:59:12| So welcome them to the neighborhood, and I'd like to make a motion to approve for staff recognition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10752)|
| 2:59:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10758)|
| 2:59:21| Mr. Kline, real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10761)|
| 2:59:24| I just want the commission not to be misled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10764)|
| 2:59:27| This 12.5 acres does not abut a five-lane highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10767)|
| 2:59:32| It doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10772)|
| 2:59:33| It goes out to Beaver Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10773)|
| 2:59:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10774)|
| 2:59:36| But, Mr. Kline, we are asking for a portion of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10776)|
| 2:59:39| The whole property goes all the way there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10779)|
| 2:59:41| We just want to show what our development area was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10781)|
| 2:59:44| We could have come in here and asked for two units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10784)|
| 2:59:47| and developed the entire portion of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10787)|
| 2:59:50| But it does, the entire property is under their contract, and we'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10790)|
| 2:59:55| So let's not tell them that this is just the only part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10795)|
| 2:59:59| And West Beaver Creek is a major arterial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10799)|
| 3:00:03| We have a motion by Commissioner Uten, second by Commissioner Roth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10803)|
| 3:00:06| to approve planned residential zoning up to five dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10806)|
| 3:00:11| per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10811)|
| 3:00:13| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10813)|
| 3:00:14| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10814)|
| 3:00:15| I know that we've got a lot still on, but I did want to make one comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10815)|
| 3:00:21| Looking at the map and seeing that there's Crown College| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10821)|
| 3:00:25| and a large church and an elementary school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10825)|
| 3:00:29| I just want to say I think it's really great to be able to get as much density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10829)|
| 3:00:35| around things like that, major places for people to gather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10835)|
| 3:00:41| I think more density would be great even because now you're going to have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10841)|
| 3:00:44| opportunity of families that can walk to these places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10844)|
| 3:00:49| even if they're driving, it's a much shorter drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10849)|
| 3:00:51| So I think that if residents of this neighborhood or participants in those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10851)|
| 3:00:58| buildings and uses decide to live here, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10858)|
| 3:01:01| I think it almost has a reverse effect on traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10861)|
| 3:01:05| But I think that in order to build a good community in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10865)|
| 3:01:08| you need people living there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10868)|
| 3:01:10| So I think this is a good move and I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10870)|
| 3:01:14| So thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10874)|
| 3:01:17| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10877)|
| 3:01:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10879)|
| 3:01:20| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10880)|

| 3:02:16| State your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10936)|
| 3:02:17| And you have up to five minutes, please, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10937)|
| 3:02:20| I'm Teresa Holly Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10940)|
| 3:02:23| I live at 8417 Ball Camp Pike, 37931.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10943)|
| 3:02:30| A year, actually, 13 months ago, I bought this property because I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10950)|
| 3:02:36| leaving the other property I had due to the building of 300 apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10956)|
| 3:02:42| within 65 feet of my home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10962)|
| 3:02:45| This was on a private land with totally undisturbed land with deer, fox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10965)|
| 3:02:52| wild turkey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10972)|
| 3:02:53| Now it's 300 apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10973)|
| 3:02:56| So I moved to 8417 Ball Camp Pike thinking that I would once again have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10976)|
| 3:03:02| this privacy and seclusion and that I would no longer have to have 12| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10982)|
| 3:03:09| hours a day, 365 days a year of bulldozers, chainsaws, hammers, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10989)|
| 3:03:16| generators and blaring loud music from construction workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=10996)|
| 3:03:22| This land also has two log cabins on it that were built in 1803.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11002)|
| 3:03:30| That's six years older than Abraham Lincoln.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11010)|
| 3:03:35| Both of these cabins are suitable for bed and breakfast or other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11015)|
| 3:03:39| activities, which were part of the reasons that I had bought the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11019)|
| 3:03:44| This property is an old area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11024)|
| 3:03:46| It's an old community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11026)|
| 3:03:48| It was also used as a community gathering place at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11028)|
| 3:03:53| It has a creek along the back side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11033)|
| 3:03:55| It has gardens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11035)|
| 3:03:58| It's about 100 feet from the railroad tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11038)|
| 3:04:02| And this piece of property that you're proposing is about 3.6 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11042)|
| 3:04:09| So this land I bought in March of 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11049)|
| 3:04:15| It's an L-shaped piece of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11055)|
| 3:04:18| These two log cabins are within 10 feet of that property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11058)|
| 3:04:24| And I can't understand why a property that small would be changing over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11064)|
| 3:04:31| to multiple residences when it's very uncommon in this area to have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11071)|
| 3:04:37| multi-residence tract like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11077)|
| 3:04:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11083)|

| 3:04:56| appreciate Ms. Frazier coming out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11096)|

| 3:05:02| So we're more than happy to do that once this is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11102)|
| 3:05:04| But we just respectfully request the approval of staff's recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11104)|
| 3:05:08| especially given zonings nearby, the trends of the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11108)|
| 3:05:13| new infrastructure coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11113)|
| 3:05:14| We have met with Engineering and Public Works to work through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11114)|
| 3:05:19| We'll hopefully, based on how this goes, be single-loading the southernmost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11119)|
| 3:05:24| portion of the property, which just means lots on only one side of the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11124)|
| 3:05:29| so there will be buffers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11129)|
| 3:05:31| And we can work through that on the concept phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11131)|
| 3:05:33| So appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11133)|
| 3:05:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11135)|

| 3:05:52| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11152)|

| 3:14:35| We also have Mr. Stephan Klar with Turner Homes as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11675)|
| 3:14:39| if there's any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11679)|
| 3:14:41| I appreciate the opposition's comments and, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11681)|
| 3:14:43| apologize if our contractor did something that they shouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11683)|
| 3:14:47| have when they were doing the testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11687)|
| 3:14:49| That's something that, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11689)|
| 3:14:51| we were not aware of until that was mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11691)|
| 3:14:53| so I certainly want to apologize to him about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11693)|
| 3:14:57| Regarding his concerns about stormwater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11697)|
| 3:14:59| we're going to have to comply and work with Knox County on making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11699)|
| 3:15:02| sure the stormwater is taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11702)|
| 3:15:05| That's one of the reasons we have a detention there designed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11705)|
| 3:15:11| keep it from flowing kind of the southwest on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11711)|
| 3:15:15| which is one of the reasons why the road is where it is for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11715)|
| 3:15:18| and for sightline purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11718)|
| 3:15:23| We went back and revised this plan from the last time to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11723)|
| 3:15:27| sure we could really capture what the impacts would be to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11727)|
| 3:15:30| hillside protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11730)|
| 3:15:32| It was on the agenda last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11732)|
| 3:15:34| And we went and revised it and said in a cul-de-sac we did a T| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11734)|
| 3:15:39| turnaround, but other than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11739)|
| 3:15:41| the development's pretty similar to what we had moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11741)|
| 3:15:44| Staff has recommended approval for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11744)|
| 3:15:47| and we would ask that it be approved per staff's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11747)|
| 3:15:49| recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11749)|
| 3:15:51| And Mr. Corlew may want to add something to that as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11751)|
| 3:15:55| and we're also here to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11755)|
| 3:15:58| Yes, Commissioner, we appreciate the concern of the neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11758)|
| 3:16:02| What we plan on doing is using an arch span bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11762)|
| 3:16:06| which we've used in other developments around the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11766)|
| 3:16:09| If you are or are not familiar with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11769)|
| 3:16:12| basically you build a foundation five foot off the bank of each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11772)|
| 3:16:15| side, and then it's a culvert that's basically bolted together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11775)|
| 3:16:20| We've had pans and large ukes go across that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11780)|
| 3:16:23| so we would not see any problem with the stream aspect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11783)|
| 3:16:27| because when I first looked at the property and the concern was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11787)|
| 3:16:31| about crossing the stream in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11791)|
| 3:16:34| that was our first solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11794)|
| 3:16:36| And that's been on the plans and what we've looked at all along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11796)|
| 3:16:40| Second thing is because the road is up against where it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11800)|
| 3:16:45| is because of the centerline of Bakertown Road in relationship to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11805)|
| 3:16:48| our proposed road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11808)|
| 3:16:50| we do have that this road is somewhat lower than Mr. Zebelin's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11810)|
| 3:16:55| property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11815)|
| 3:16:56| Of course, he purchased the property during the midst of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11816)|
| 3:16:59| development, and we'll certainly be happy to work with him on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11819)|
| 3:17:02| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11822)|
| 3:17:04| Thank you, Mr. Corlew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=11824)|

| 3:22:30| We would like to withdraw this item from the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12150)|
| 3:22:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12154)|
| 3:22:35| Is there anybody here to speak in opposition to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12155)|
| 3:22:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12158)|
| 3:22:39| You want to come up to the podium, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12159)|
| 3:22:41| State your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12161)|
| 3:22:47| My name is Damon Falconier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12167)|
| 3:22:49| My address is 11605 Gates Mill Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37930.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12169)|
| 3:22:55| No, 37934, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12175)|
| 3:22:57| And I came to present this information today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12177)|
| 3:23:02| I requested to meet with the developer and the designer four or five times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12182)|
| 3:23:11| and was rejected, so I felt like I needed to bring my concerns here to you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12191)|
| 3:23:16| But since the developer has chosen and told me if I took it off of consent, he would withdraw,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12196)|
| 3:23:22| I guess that's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12202)|
| 3:23:25| You're not objecting to the withdrawal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12205)|
| 3:23:28| I'm objecting to the withdrawal because I really wanted them as a neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12208)|
| 3:23:31| I think it's a great opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12211)|
| 3:23:34| It's a great design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12214)|
| 3:23:36| I just had a few concerns and would like to see it reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12216)|
| 3:23:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12222)|
| 3:23:44| All right, we have a request withdrawal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12224)|
| 3:23:46| Mr. Mullen, do you have anything you want to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12226)|
| 3:23:48| Just a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12228)|
| 3:23:49| Mr. Falconier has been good to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12229)|
| 3:23:51| I've worked with him and tried to talk with him as much as I can on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12231)|
| 3:23:56| There's some extenuating circumstances behind this that if this wasn't going to go through on consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12236)|
| 3:24:04| the applicant wanted me to withdraw the application, so that's what I'm asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12244)|
| 3:24:09| I would have liked to have worked with Mr. Falconier more if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12249)|
| 3:24:12| Thank you, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12252)|
| 3:24:14| I'm not sure I understand all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12254)|
| 3:24:17| Chair, we'll entertain a motion to withdraw at the request of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12257)|
| 3:24:20| Motion to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12260)|

| 3:24:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12269)|
| 3:24:30| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12270)|
| 3:24:31| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12271)|
| 3:24:33| All right, this is a new one on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12273)|
| 3:24:36| Next is agenda item number 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12276)|
| 3:24:38| This is the development plan, file 3H22-UR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12278)|
| 3:24:42| The applicant is Land Development Solutions, E.J. Baxa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12282)|
| 3:24:48| Excuse me, Rusty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12288)|
| 3:24:49| Location, northwest side of Strawberry Plains Pike across its intersection with Wayland Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12289)|
| 3:24:55| Size of tract, 7.9 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12295)|
| 3:24:58| Zoning is PR plan residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12298)|
| 3:25:00| Existing land use is single family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12300)|
| 3:25:03| Proposed use attached and detached residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12303)|
| 3:25:06| Density proposed, 7.5 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12306)|
| 3:25:11| Motion by staff or recommendation by staff, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12311)|
| 3:25:15| approve the development plan for up to 58 attached dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12315)|
| 3:25:19| and one detached dwelling unit subject to seven conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12319)|
| 3:25:23| Mr. Baxa, I see you're present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12323)|
| 3:25:26| Is there any opposition to this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12326)|
| 3:25:28| Mr. Baxa, would you like to go first or would you like opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12328)|
| 3:25:31| I'll go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12331)|
| 3:25:33| My name is Rusty Baxa, Land Development Solutions, 310 Simmons Road, Suite K, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12333)|
| 3:25:42| We're just happy with the staff recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12342)|
| 3:25:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12346)|
| 3:25:48| Yes, ma'am, would you like to come up and address the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12348)|
| 3:25:51| Please state your name and address, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12351)|
| 3:25:55| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12355)|
| 3:25:56| My name is Sharon Rush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12356)|
| 3:25:57| I represent myself and my husband.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12357)|
| 3:25:59| There are a few of us that are on that adjacent piece of property for that subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12359)|
| 3:26:03| that backs up to the proposed subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12363)|
| 3:26:08| We commented agreeing with a lot of the concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12368)|
| 3:26:12| Could you pull the mic down a little closer to your face?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12372)|
| 3:26:15| Sorry, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12375)|
| 3:26:17| Without a doubt, it just seems the major reasonable concern that we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12377)|
| 3:26:21| along with the rest of us at Wisteria Plantation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12381)|
| 3:26:23| was the need for a suitable quality fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12383)|
| 3:26:25| or a buffer between ourselves and the new subdivision that is going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12385)|
| 3:26:30| We did see that they had sent forth an amended proposal with the landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12390)|
| 3:26:36| that did add evergreens on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12396)|
| 3:26:39| We were wondering if that would include a berm as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12399)|
| 3:26:41| It just makes for good neighbors and to enhance both the quality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12401)|
| 3:26:44| and the value of the homes for both of our neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12404)|
| 3:26:48| The landscape plan indicates that trees planted behind each townhome all around the complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12408)|
| 3:26:53| except, oddly enough, behind the homes that face our shared property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12413)|
| 3:26:58| That would be the cluster of six rear-facing and side-facing cluster of four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12418)|
| 3:27:04| It would seem that the future residents themselves would desire to have trees in their yard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12424)|
| 3:27:09| along with their lots, regardless that there would be a buffer wall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12429)|
| 3:27:15| that would be planted or erected in addition between our two subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12435)|
| 3:27:20| Landscaping should be planted equally throughout the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12440)|
| 3:27:25| not just for an aesthetic and ecological, but also for a practical need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12445)|
| 3:27:29| So the mentioned parcels on that concept landscape plan are inconsistent with the rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12449)|
| 3:27:34| That was all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12454)|
| 3:27:35| Also, lastly, the single-story family home that is originally on Strawberry Plains Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12455)|
| 3:27:43| supposedly not included in the proposed community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12463)|
| 3:27:46| is it to remain a private residence, or would there be future plans for that home on Lot 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12466)|
| 3:27:52| in connection with Strawberry Meadows?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12472)|
| 3:27:54| So we were just concerned if it would be turned into a community place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12474)|
| 3:27:58| that we would be concerned for future neighborhood privacies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12478)|
| 3:28:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12482)|
| 3:28:05| Curtis Eddy, 2507 Ellis Town Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12485)|
| 3:28:11| I'm the property owner with my father.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12491)|
| 3:28:13| We build homes together, and Rusty is doing the engineering for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12493)|
| 3:28:17| Can I just address those concerns, if that's all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12497)|
| 3:28:21| We went back and we added the landscaping fence there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12501)|
| 3:28:24| and the reason that they're different than the other trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12504)|
| 3:28:27| is just our landscaper recommended doing evergreens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12507)|
| 3:28:30| You can see that along the line there that we've pretty heavily covered it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12510)|
| 3:28:35| to try to do as best as we could to make it private.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12515)|
| 3:28:39| Along with that, I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12519)|
| 3:28:42| We've worked with staff, and we've already kind of moved the subdivision road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12522)|
| 3:28:45| to line it up with Wayland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12525)|
| 3:28:47| I know that was a concern we had, so we had to eliminate some units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12527)|
| 3:28:50| and move that road down to the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12530)|
| 3:28:53| Other than that, I think all the other items we've addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12533)|
| 3:28:56| the staff has asked us to, right, Rusty?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12536)|
| 3:28:58| Okay, cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12538)|
| 3:28:59| Yeah, we just asked that we approve based on staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12539)|
| 3:29:02| and appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12542)|
| 3:29:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12544)|
| 3:29:06| Mr. Baczka, actually, do you have any other comments you'd like to make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12546)|
| 3:29:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12549)|
| 3:29:11| I recognize Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12551)|
| 3:29:14| Yes, I think I'm looking at the right one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12554)|
| 3:29:18| There was a question that came up about the mailbox area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12558)|
| 3:29:23| Are you aware of that question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12563)|
| 3:29:25| I did read that question last night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12565)|
| 3:29:26| and we haven't identified exactly on the plan where the boxes are going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12566)|
| 3:29:30| We were going to do that when we go through planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12570)|
| 3:29:33| I don't know why that was an issue because the neighbors are asking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12573)|
| 3:29:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12577)|
| 3:29:38| But that was something that was brought up as a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12578)|
| 3:29:41| But, I mean, that'll be, you know, it'll make sense how we lay it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12581)|
| 3:29:44| That's planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12584)|
| 3:29:45| Yeah, it'll be taken care of in planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12585)|
| 3:29:47| The other is, was this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12587)|
| 3:29:50| did it not contain a view of the front of the structures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12590)|
| 3:29:55| Oh, yeah, it's on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12595)|
| 3:29:57| I'm struck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12597)|
| 3:29:58| Whoever's driving, can you, yes, that's, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12598)|
| 3:30:03| This is just a critique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12603)|
| 3:30:06| It makes me sad when there's that much real estate given to garage doors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12606)|
| 3:30:12| because that really affects how people feel about the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12612)|
| 3:30:18| and the human component versus the car component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12618)|
| 3:30:21| So a critique from the sidelines of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12621)|
| 3:30:25| be nice to see designs that didn't have such a forward-facing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12625)|
| 3:30:28| and large space given to a garage door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12628)|
| 3:30:31| Sure, yeah, that would make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12631)|
| 3:30:32| I know for this specific property, when we bought it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12632)|
| 3:30:35| the county had it slated for apartments in the future growth plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12635)|
| 3:30:38| where we're right off the highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12638)|
| 3:30:40| And we didn't want to do, like, an apartment complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12640)|
| 3:30:42| That's why we wanted to do townhouse style with garages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12642)|
| 3:30:46| which is, like, a much nicer aspect, we thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12646)|
| 3:30:49| But it is quite entry-level compared to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12649)|
| 3:30:52| something with a side entrance garage door where it would be hidden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12652)|
| 3:30:54| but, you know, like you would find on a custom home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12654)|
| 3:30:56| But it makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12656)|
| 3:30:58| But we'll make them cute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12658)|
| 3:30:59| I mean, we just completed some in South Knoxville that we did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12659)|
| 3:31:02| and they're very tasteful and, you know, quality construction, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12662)|
| 3:31:08| Chair, we'll entertain a motion to approve the development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12668)|
| 3:31:11| for up to 58 attached dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12671)|
| 3:31:13| and one detached dwelling unit subject to seven conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12673)|
| 3:31:18| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12678)|
| 3:31:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12679)|
| 3:31:20| Motion by Commissioner Uten, seconded by Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12680)|
| 3:31:24| to approve the development plan per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12684)|
| 3:31:27| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12687)|
| 3:31:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12689)|
| 3:31:30| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12690)|
| 3:31:31| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12691)|
| 3:31:32| Thank you, gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12692)|
| 3:31:33| Thanks for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12693)|
| 3:31:35| Last item on the agenda is item number 59, and that is mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12695)|
| 3:31:42| We recently amended the bylaws to move the annual election of officers to the June meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12702)|
| 3:31:49| I am required to appoint a nominating committee at the April meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12709)|
| 3:31:54| and then on the May 12th meeting we will entertain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12714)|
| 3:32:00| I guess, other floor nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12720)|
| 3:32:04| So this time I'm going to nominate Commissioner Roth, Commissioner Eddie Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12724)|
| 3:32:10| and Commissioner Perez to sit on the nominating committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12730)|
| 3:32:14| and Chairman Roth, if you, Mr. Roth, if you would chair that committee and organize it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12734)|
| 3:32:19| we'd be much appreciative of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12739)|
| 3:32:21| Not at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12741)|
| 3:32:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12742)|
| 3:32:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12743)|
| 3:32:24| Seeing no other business before the commission, anything else we need to discuss?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12744)|
| 3:32:28| Ladies and gentlemen, we're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220414?start=12748)|
