| 0:00:00| Any other questions? Okay, Mr. Davis, give us your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=0)|
| 0:00:13| Yeah, my name is Scott Davis, P.O. Box 11315, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37939.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=13)|
| 0:00:19| We've heard a lot of complicated stuff and a lot of details. I'm going to try to make it really, really simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=19)|
| 0:00:26| This map right here has been referred to several times. The purple lines on the map are the beautiful ridges that identify this region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=26)|
| 0:00:36| When this task force was originally began, the whole intent was to protect the beautiful ridgetops we have here in Knox County in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=36)|
| 0:00:47| Somehow through that process, over three years, it went from protecting the ridgetops to incorporating over 300,000 acres of land and 60-something thousand different parcels and property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=47)|
| 0:01:01| How did we get from that to where we are today? It's a very typical process in government. It's an encroachment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=61)|
| 0:01:08| You begin what sounds like a really good idea that we all could agree to, and it slowly encroached down to, at one point, all the way down from the top of the ridges all the way down to the creeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=68)|
| 0:01:23| That was amended and taken out by MPC because TDEC already covers that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=83)|
| 0:01:28| We keep hearing that nothing changes in this plan. We keep hearing nothing changes, nothing changes, nothing changes below 40%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=88)|
| 0:01:36| If nothing changes below 40%, then why do we have all this land below 40% incorporated into this plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=96)|
| 0:01:46| I think that's a legitimate question for you all to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=106)|
| 0:01:50| What is the definition of low-density residential? Does anybody know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=110)|
| 0:01:59| What's the definition of low-density residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=119)|
| 0:02:08| The definition of low-density residential depends on which portion of the county you're in according to the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=128)|
| 0:02:17| If you're in the rural area, it's roughly one unit per acre. If you're in the planned growth area and in the county, it's five units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=137)|
| 0:02:30| And if you're in the urban growth area and in the city, it's up to six units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=150)|
| 0:02:39| Thank you. We keep hearing that nothing changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=159)|
| 0:02:43| We heard the definition of low-density residential. If you're building in the county right now under planned residential, low-density, that is five or possibly six units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=163)|
| 0:02:55| Right now, under this proposed plan, anything over 15% has a maximum density of two units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=175)|
| 0:03:04| But wait a minute, we just heard that nothing has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=184)|
| 0:03:08| The definition of low-density residential in the 15% range, in the 18% range, or how about the 30-something thousand acres that are zero to 15% that also fall under this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=188)|
| 0:03:22| would be under low-density residential at five units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=202)|
| 0:03:26| But under the proposed plan and the 70-something pages incorporated there, the maximum density permitted would be two units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=206)|
| 0:03:35| So you tell me whether something has changed. In my mind, as a developer, it has significantly changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=215)|
| 0:03:43| In addition, they talk about credits, density credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=223)|
| 0:03:48| May. May is a big word when you're dealing with government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=228)|
| 0:03:53| And I really appreciate the time that you all put into this and the service you give to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=233)|
| 0:03:59| It's a tough job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=239)|
| 0:04:02| When a proposed development is made in your area, in the city, and all of a sudden 100 people show up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=242)|
| 0:04:11| and they don't want five units an acre next to their two-unit-per-acre subdivision, what happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=251)|
| 0:04:20| Do you really think that those densities are going to be permitted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=260)|
| 0:04:24| The density credits is we may give density credits. It doesn't say we will give density credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=264)|
| 0:04:32| If you're giving up this 20 acres of land over here, you should definitively get the credits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=272)|
| 0:04:38| not something that is subjective to a loud audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=278)|
| 0:04:45| Again, I'm going to make this simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=285)|
| 0:04:48| If you want to build affordable housing in Knoxville, and it's over 15 units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=288)|
| 0:04:56| and let me digress, the last five apartment complexes built in Knox County were all built on land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=296)|
| 0:05:04| that falls under this overlay, whatever you want to call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=304)|
| 0:05:11| If you don't mind, just take a piece of paper, write down 200 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=311)|
| 0:05:20| If you want to build a 200-unit apartment complex, and it is in the overlay or the hillside protection area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=320)|
| 0:05:29| and you have a maximum density of two units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=329)|
| 0:05:34| how many acres do you have to have to be able to build a 200-unit complex?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=334)|
| 0:05:41| You'd have to have 100 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=341)|
| 0:05:45| But on top of that, under this proposed plan, the maximum allowed permitted clearing would be 50% of that 100 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=345)|
| 0:05:59| So now you have a 100-acre piece of land to be able to build 200 apartment units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=359)|
| 0:06:04| but you can only clear 50% of that land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=364)|
| 0:06:09| How many 100-acre parcels of land are there in the city of Knoxville, contiguous parcels of land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=369)|
| 0:06:17| I would say none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=377)|
| 0:06:20| So the ability to build affordable housing in the city of Knoxville would be totally eliminated under this proposed plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=380)|
| 0:06:28| And we keep hearing that nothing has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=388)|
| 0:06:32| It has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=392)|
| 0:06:33| It will change significantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=393)|
| 0:06:36| We talk about Sequoyah Hills and Holston Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=396)|
| 0:06:39| Guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=399)|
| 0:06:40| Those beautiful subdivisions, I think everybody would agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=400)|
| 0:06:42| those are two of the most beautiful subdivisions built in all of Knox County in the past 80 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=402)|
| 0:06:50| Those happen without an MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=410)|
| 0:06:53| Those happen without regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=413)|
| 0:06:55| Those were market-driven developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=415)|
| 0:07:00| How many more restrictions do we need to be able to build a subdivision like Sequoyah Hills?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=420)|
| 0:07:05| But also, when you look at Sequoyah Hills and you're talking about the densities up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=425)|
| 0:07:09| I'm not allowed to use floodplain land for my density purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=429)|
| 0:07:14| But I may be wrong, but I believe that in Holston Hills and Sequoyah Hills analogies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=434)|
| 0:07:20| they were using the floodland area as part of their density calculations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=440)|
| 0:07:24| I very well could be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=444)|
| 0:07:25| If I'm wrong, they can prove me wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=445)|
| 0:07:27| But I'm not allowed to use floodland for my density calculations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=447)|
| 0:07:33| This is a complicated issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=453)|
| 0:07:34| It's been back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=454)|
| 0:07:35| You all have heard the pros and cons, both sides, good, bad, and different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=455)|
| 0:07:41| We're in a very challenging time as it relates to the economic development of our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=461)|
| 0:07:48| and people in my industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=468)|
| 0:07:50| Some of the greatest developers we have around here, the Bob Talbots of the world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=470)|
| 0:07:53| the Bob Monies of the world, you read about these guys in a paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=473)|
| 0:07:57| Do we really need more restrictions that make it more and more difficult to do what we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=477)|
| 0:08:03| Do we need more government regulation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=483)|
| 0:08:06| Do we need to make it harder for us to promote economic development, increase the tax base, and create jobs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=486)|
| 0:08:12| If your answer to those questions is yes, then vote for this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=492)|
| 0:08:16| My hope is that you will not, and I hope and pray that you do not, send us back to NBC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=496)|
| 0:08:20| allow us to come up with a plan that's fair and reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=500)|
| 0:08:24| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=504)|
| 0:08:26| Doyle Webb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=506)|
| 0:08:30| Oh, Councilman Dellavope, you've got a question here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=510)|
| 0:08:32| Is this for Mr. Davis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=512)|
| 0:08:34| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=514)|
| 0:08:35| Mr. Davis, if I could borrow you for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=515)|
| 0:08:39| It's good exercise running up and down that hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=519)|
| 0:08:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=521)|
| 0:08:42| I need to exercise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=522)|
| 0:08:45| What would you do different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=525)|
| 0:08:46| Are you one of the ones talking about the 40% and upslope requirements, or how would you do it different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=526)|
| 0:08:52| Because you were one of the ones that participated in the task force, and so you had some input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=532)|
| 0:08:57| How would you tackle the problem differently if you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=537)|
| 0:09:01| Yeah, I may need to correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=541)|
| 0:09:02| I was not on the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=542)|
| 0:09:03| I did attend several of the task force meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=543)|
| 0:09:07| Development above 40% is incredibly challenging and very, very, very expensive to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=547)|
| 0:09:13| It takes a very special developer, a very special technique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=553)|
| 0:09:18| To develop over 40%, you're not going to have massive hillside development over 40%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=558)|
| 0:09:24| It's just cost prohibitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=564)|
| 0:09:26| Look at Lookout Mountain and Signal Mountain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=566)|
| 0:09:29| I mean, those are nice developments on ridgetops, but you can only do it with very expensive housing because it costs so much to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=569)|
| 0:09:39| So to answer your question, we're already doing it below 40%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=579)|
| 0:09:45| How many developments in the city of Knoxville would you consider really poorly done developments in the past 20 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=585)|
| 0:09:56| Can you name one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=596)|
| 0:10:00| Well, we have some that flood, and we have some that have mudslides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=600)|
| 0:10:03| and we have some that obviously the care wasn't used to build them properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=603)|
| 0:10:07| Now, whether that's a function of bad enforcement, bad contractor, I don't know what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=607)|
| 0:10:14| Obviously, we have some that have problems in them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=614)|
| 0:10:16| and they fall back to the governmental body to try to cure them after the fact if the developer isn't solvent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=616)|
| 0:10:23| I mean, that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=623)|
| 0:10:24| Yes, sir, and those few episodes are horribly unfortunate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=624)|
| 0:10:28| and there's different reasons why each of those things happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=628)|
| 0:10:33| but I think the city of Knoxville has done a really good job of enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=633)|
| 0:10:37| I think you have good quality development in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=637)|
| 0:10:40| You have some nice subdivisions in the city, and to answer your question, we're already doing the things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=640)|
| 0:10:45| There is a couple of poster children out there that shouldn't have been developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=645)|
| 0:10:50| I agree, but why are we throwing the entire baby out with bathwater?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=650)|
| 0:10:57| So you think it overreaches in that sense, and I was asking you if you had a specific proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=657)|
| 0:11:02| I didn't understand how we came up with 40 percent other than the numbers shrink the acreage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=662)|
| 0:11:07| I mean, why not 30 percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=667)|
| 0:11:09| Why not the angle of repose, three to one or whatever it is that you use when you're sloping land to protect it from sliding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=669)|
| 0:11:15| I mean, how do you come up with a standard that gets the problem areas under greater scrutiny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=675)|
| 0:11:22| but doesn't overwhelm the large acreage that you're concerned about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=682)|
| 0:11:28| Well, if you want to get a little more specific with it, as it relates to the ridges, I would establish an elevation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=688)|
| 0:11:35| an elevation line that you want to protect, like TVA has an 820 line we're all familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=695)|
| 0:11:41| Why would we not establish an elevation line on these ridges and say, okay, anything above this elevation line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=701)|
| 0:11:49| we need to have very strict and stringent guidelines by which to do anything with that land to protect those ridgetops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=709)|
| 0:11:57| You're saying the taller ones are more visible and obviously more important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=717)|
| 0:12:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=720)|
| 0:12:02| And then anything that falls below that 15 to 40 percent, as MPC already attests to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=722)|
| 0:12:09| we already have regulations in place that are dealing with those already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=729)|
| 0:12:14| So the 40 percent line is the line that MPC came up with, and we're not objecting to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=734)|
| 0:12:20| because very few developers are going to want to go over 40 percent anyways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=740)|
| 0:12:25| And it should be very strictly regulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=745)|
| 0:12:27| If you're going to develop over 40 percent, you should have incredibly stringent guidelines to develop over 40 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=747)|
| 0:12:33| I would agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=753)|
| 0:12:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=756)|
| 0:12:37| Thank you much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=757)|
| 0:12:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=758)|
| 0:12:39| Mr. Webb, if you could give us your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=759)|
| 0:12:44| Thank you, Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=764)|
| 0:12:46| My name is Doyle Webb and my address is 8014 Willowstone, Powell, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=766)|
| 0:12:52| Thank you, Mr. Bailey, Mayor, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=772)|
| 0:12:58| I didn't bring my glasses with me, but I've got a little thing I'd like to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=778)|
| 0:13:05| This plan, it was designed to identify steep slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=785)|
| 0:13:11| And your steep slopes is not 15 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=791)|
| 0:13:14| When you get into 15 percent, that's not what I call steep slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=794)|
| 0:13:19| And so we think, just like Mr. Davis said, the ridges and everything, we're all on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=799)|
| 0:13:27| We all want to protect our ridges and our trees and the way we developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=807)|
| 0:13:32| It's gotten smarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=812)|
| 0:13:34| It's gotten more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=814)|
| 0:13:35| It's about engineering, is one of the questions you asked, is when you take a piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=815)|
| 0:13:40| and it doesn't matter how it lays, every piece of property is not going to be the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=820)|
| 0:13:44| If you put a blanket on everything and just say, this is the way we're going to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=824)|
| 0:13:48| it shouldn't be the way we do business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=828)|
| 0:13:51| But if you engineer the property right and lay it out the way the slopes are here and the way it's leveled here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=831)|
| 0:13:59| then you take care of the problems as you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=839)|
| 0:14:02| But even a flat piece of property, if it's laid out wrong and done wrong, it's going to be a bad piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=842)|
| 0:14:11| So the slopes is more critical and more time consuming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=851)|
| 0:14:17| But this plan got lost in the slope and density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=857)|
| 0:14:22| The problem is the clearing and the grading restrictions that prevents building roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=862)|
| 0:14:29| No roads, no development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=869)|
| 0:14:31| No development, no growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=871)|
| 0:14:33| They talked about smaller roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=873)|
| 0:14:35| That gets into being a safety issue as well when you put in smaller roads in the city with fire trucks and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=875)|
| 0:14:44| And the problem is that the hillside and ridge top plan from MPC takes property value away from landowners and prevents reasonable growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=884)|
| 0:14:55| It prevents potential expansion on our tax base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=895)|
| 0:15:00| Shouldn't there have been a physical analyst to see how this plan affects the future potential tax base?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=900)|
| 0:15:10| Shouldn't the city and the county engineering have written a report on this plan before MPC voted on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=910)|
| 0:15:19| The Knoxville Chamber presented an alternative plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=919)|
| 0:15:24| There's also a couple other alternative plans that was presented to the county council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=924)|
| 0:15:30| The Sevierville plan has a good plan that would work with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=930)|
| 0:15:36| But they've all been turned down that we'd like for you guys to vote this down because there's no compromise on this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=936)|
| 0:15:43| If you turn it down like the county did and just take it back to MPC, we can all work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=943)|
| 0:15:51| And I think one of the questions was, you know, where was we at when they started this plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=951)|
| 0:15:58| A lot of us weren't worried about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| We had developers on this task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=960)|
| 0:16:03| Then when we started seeing the developers come and saying they've got a problem because it started going one-sided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=963)|
| 0:16:10| they pretty much got left out and they didn't have a vote in this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| So that's where, as I say, I am a home builder and I'm also a realtor broker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=973)|
| 0:16:23| Me, personally, it's where I get concerned is when you start getting emotional and start going one way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=983)|
| 0:16:30| that's where I start getting involved personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=990)|
| 0:16:33| But the Knoxville, let me just start here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=993)|
| 0:16:39| Is it a problem to reboot this hillside and ridgetop plan and give it back to MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=999)|
| 0:16:49| Is it a really big thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1009)|
| 0:16:52| This plan took three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1012)|
| 0:16:55| A second look at it with engineering overview and financial projections seems like a good government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1015)|
| 0:17:03| I don't have my glasses with me, so I'll bear with me on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1023)|
| 0:17:06| The county commission voted this down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1026)|
| 0:17:09| Don't we want the city and the county on the same page here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1029)|
| 0:17:15| So we're asking for you to vote this down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| Send it back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1038)|
| 0:17:21| on a plan that will work for us and have our tax and grow the right way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1041)|
| 0:17:26| We've had problems with developments, especially through 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1046)|
| 0:17:35| The market was demanding build, build, build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| Then the market fell off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1058)|
| 0:17:40| So we got stuck with some developments that created some problems that we was talking about with mud and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1060)|
| 0:17:47| With some of the act-of-God things that we see around here, we're going to have problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1067)|
| 0:17:53| But with regulations already in place, we can fix these problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1073)|
| 0:17:57| So I thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| I do have a son that's with Down syndrome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| He's getting ready to do a play, so I'm going to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1083)|
| 0:18:05| Scott Davis, if you've got any questions or anything, he's more qualified than I am on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1085)|
| 0:18:11| So I thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1091)|
| 0:18:13| Thank you, Mr. Webb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1093)|
| 0:18:14| Robin Hill, if you could give us your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1094)|
| 0:18:25| I'm sort of tottering around because I'm learning to use a new left knee, which doesn't exactly work all right all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1105)|
| 0:18:33| And I apologize for the alarm that went off, which tells me to take seven pills at 6 o'clock at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1113)|
| 0:18:39| But that's one of the benefits of being old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1119)|
| 0:18:42| My name is Robert M. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1122)|
| 0:18:45| I live at 11504 Mountain View Road, Knoxville, 37934.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1125)|
| 0:18:51| For those of you who know the zip code, that's in Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1131)|
| 0:18:54| I'm here to represent the Sierra Club, Harvey Broome Group of the Sierra Club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1134)|
| 0:18:59| which represents about 800 people in Knox County and the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1139)|
| 0:19:05| as well as another 700 in the surrounding 19 counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1145)|
| 0:19:09| We are a grassroots environmental organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1149)|
| 0:19:12| We've been in existence for 118 years, started by John Muir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1152)|
| 0:19:17| We've been here a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1157)|
| 0:19:20| We applaud the ability that we have to do grassroots environmental work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1160)|
| 0:19:31| which means that we can talk about environmental things in our hometown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1171)|
| 0:19:35| rather than talking to congressmen and people like that who we have very little influence over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1175)|
| 0:19:40| I figure that the closer you can get government to the people, the better off you are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1180)|
| 0:19:45| and the town's government is as close as you can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1185)|
| 0:19:50| So I'm here to talk to you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| I'm not one of your constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1192)|
| 0:19:56| And some 800, I'd say about half or 60 percent of the 800 people we have in Knox County are your constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1196)|
| 0:20:06| We like the plan as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1206)|
| 0:20:08| We believe it's reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1208)|
| 0:20:11| From my personal standpoint, it contains a lot of really good things that I've seen tried in action before, as has Mr. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1211)|
| 0:20:22| It also doesn't contain some things I'd really like to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1222)|
| 0:20:27| But politics is the art of the possible, and you can't get everything you want in every potential plan or bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1227)|
| 0:20:37| I'd like to see the chart that this gentleman had showing the roadway, the bullets on the roadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1237)|
| 0:20:49| the number of lots and things of that sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1249)|
| 0:20:52| Can I see that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1252)|
| 0:20:54| Can you project that for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1254)|
| 0:20:57| If you could continue on while he does that, I'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1257)|
| 0:21:01| Yeah, I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1261)|
| 0:21:03| Part of my experience in life, I've been in the engineering business for 61 years, starting in January 1, 1950.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1263)|
| 0:21:12| I'm a professional engineer in Tennessee, number 9629.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1272)|
| 0:21:16| I've done a lot of engineering work, done it all my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1276)|
| 0:21:19| I like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| The last 27 years, I've been involved with the Farragut Municipal Planning Commission, both as a member and as a chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1282)|
| 0:21:32| And we've had a number of challenges out there, which started a new town from scratch almost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1292)|
| 0:21:39| With 4,000 people, we now have 20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1299)|
| 0:21:43| We have learned a lot in the planning business in that period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1303)|
| 0:21:49| One of the things that we put in that's been most practical and most accepted by all the builders that I know of is a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1309)|
| 0:21:59| is a zoning district that we call Open Space Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1319)|
| 0:22:04| And can you bring that up now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1324)|
| 0:22:10| Well, I'll just go over some of the things that are on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1330)|
| 0:22:14| The advantage of a lot of these things, in fact, all of these things are advantages to builders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1334)|
| 0:22:20| They save you money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1340)|
| 0:22:23| We allowed in this Open Space Residential District the setting of a discrete number of dwelling units on a discrete piece of land of a type of zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1343)|
| 0:22:36| R1 in our case or R2 or R3 or R4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1356)|
| 0:22:40| And we allowed the builders to move those houses around wherever they wanted on that, say, 100-acre lot, 100-acre parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1360)|
| 0:22:52| to miss geological features that were present, like sinkholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1372)|
| 0:22:58| And we essentially did away with a fixed-size lot, cookie-cutter made out of the 100 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1378)|
| 0:23:10| and said that, well, we'll put on this 100 acres, we'll put 200 units of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1390)|
| 0:23:15| And we let the builders put those things on lots that were very much smaller than the rated lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1395)|
| 0:23:23| Well, what does that do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| That reduces your cost of infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1404)|
| 0:23:27| We also allowed, in one case out there, a very big subdivision, 20-foot roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1407)|
| 0:23:33| What does that do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| That did for us, it cut down the footprint of the road a considerable amount, reduced the amount of grading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1415)|
| 0:23:42| We changed the design speed on the road so that we didn't have to build a highway in a residential subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1422)|
| 0:23:49| and made it altogether cheaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| Getting the houses close together reduces the infrastructure on the underground utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1431)|
| 0:23:56| and the power in any other utility that you put in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1436)|
| 0:24:01| So that's a big advantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1441)|
| 0:24:03| Those things are worth money to developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1443)|
| 0:24:08| And let's get the real player into this act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1448)|
| 0:24:13| This plan is about a plan for a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1453)|
| 0:24:17| It's complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1457)|
| 0:24:18| It's like Chairman Edwards or Mr. Edwards commented about the industrial park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1458)|
| 0:24:25| A city requires a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1465)|
| 0:24:27| That plan, the plan of this city has evolved in the some 60 years that I've lived here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1467)|
| 0:24:33| It's evolved continuously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1473)|
| 0:24:35| This is just another evolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1475)|
| 0:24:37| It doesn't do anything but improve the situation for the future residents of this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1477)|
| 0:24:46| who will be the buyers of the homes that are built on these pieces of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1486)|
| 0:24:51| And I think in a period of a few years you are ready to see on the undeveloped land that's in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1491)|
| 0:24:59| and in the county a very sharp increase in the attractiveness of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1499)|
| 0:25:06| You'll see that the real beauty of this area are the hills and the slopes, the ridge tops, the trees, the water courses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1506)|
| 0:25:21| The geology or rather the topography of the land is what makes it a nice place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1521)|
| 0:25:28| And this plan, I think, protects that topography better than anything I've seen before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1528)|
| 0:25:35| And I would recommend that you look carefully at this chart that I tried to get up but can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1535)|
| 0:25:43| It's not my chart, so I can't get it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| But, in fact, look carefully at the plan in general and what it does in a positive way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1545)|
| 0:25:53| rather than what a group of people who build houses and sell houses feel are negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1553)|
| 0:26:00| Because you're also dealing with the remaining citizens of this county, which number a couple of hundred thousand of this city, rather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1560)|
| 0:26:09| And they're your constituents, all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1569)|
| 0:26:13| And they're the ones who are going to live in these houses that are built and sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1573)|
| 0:26:18| Not the developer isn't going to live in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1578)|
| 0:26:20| He won't be found ten years after he builds a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| He's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1583)|
| 0:26:24| But the homeowner will still be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1584)|
| 0:26:27| So we think that this plan ought to be adopted by the city council as it is written, unchanged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1587)|
| 0:26:36| because we feel that it will be a step forward in the presentation of property in the future for this town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1596)|
| 0:26:46| and the people who want to live here in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1606)|
| 0:26:49| It will help us in the long run achieve the attractiveness that we have in the town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1609)|
| 0:26:56| and the attractiveness that can be had if we adopt this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1616)|
| 0:27:00| So thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1620)|
| 0:27:03| I will also extend the same courtesy to you all that Mr. Edwards extended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1623)|
| 0:27:10| We are happy to work as the Sierra Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1630)|
| 0:27:13| We are happy to work with the city council, with the committee that developed this plan in any way we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1633)|
| 0:27:23| to make a contribution of our feelings and the reasons we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1643)|
| 0:27:28| So we offer that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1648)|
| 0:27:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1650)|
| 0:27:31| We will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1651)|
| 0:27:32| Councilman Del Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1652)|
| 0:27:33| If I could ask a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1653)|
| 0:27:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1654)|
| 0:27:37| One of the statements that was made by the developer that was up here was that this will impact affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1657)|
| 0:27:43| which I guess means lower-cost housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1663)|
| 0:27:47| You happen to be coming from Farragut, a high-rent district kind of place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1667)|
| 0:27:51| How do you answer that concern that maybe we'll be taking low-income housing out of the marketplace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1671)|
| 0:28:00| or making it more difficult to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| Is that a concern to you as an engineer or as a planner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1682)|
| 0:28:06| Well, I'm not a marketer of houses, but I am a student of the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1686)|
| 0:28:13| And houses will be built in the price category that will make the builder the most money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1693)|
| 0:28:21| And that's the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1701)|
| 0:28:23| That's why you have these large, expensive houses built and not many small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1703)|
| 0:28:28| If there's a niche for a small, affordable housing, then that niche will be filled by somebody who can make money on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1708)|
| 0:28:37| And I don't think it will affect it at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1717)|
| 0:28:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| Thank you, Mr. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1722)|
| 0:28:43| Ron Peabody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1723)|
| 0:28:55| Okay, if you could come forward and give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1735)|
| 0:28:59| My name is Jamie Dobbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1739)|
| 0:29:00| I'm president of the League of Women Voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| I'm a resident of Knox County, but our organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1742)|
| 0:29:06| I'm speaking on behalf of our organization with 180 members, many of whom are constituents here in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1746)|
| 0:29:14| Anyway, I just wanted to, you know, first thank you, council members and the chair, for letting me speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1754)|
| 0:29:23| We know, the league particularly knows, that this is a very demanding job, and we're supremely grateful for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1763)|
| 0:29:30| We know and respect that you want to do the right thing to protect our resources and our economy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1770)|
| 0:29:36| and make a decision that respects the rights of property owners in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1776)|
| 0:29:41| And given the great amount of attention to property rights in this discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1781)|
| 0:29:46| we want to remind you of a very important group of property owners and their rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1786)|
| 0:29:52| Those who live downstream of steep slopes and poorly developed land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1792)|
| 0:29:57| And, you know, they may not be able to take out full-page ads in the paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1797)|
| 0:30:02| but the majority of citizens want their properties protected from the consequences of flooding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1802)|
| 0:30:08| landslides, erosion, and costly remediation, which the plan leads to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1808)|
| 0:30:14| I understand that it doesn't give the, it does not have the force of law, but it's the step toward that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1814)|
| 0:30:22| I found some numbers that make my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1822)|
| 0:30:24| According to what we've learned about this issue, the majority of citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1824)|
| 0:30:29| majority of parcels do not fall into the affected area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1829)|
| 0:30:32| Only 30% of the parcels in the slope protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1832)|
| 0:30:37| Those in low-density residential fall under the plan, and, well, 2.5% of commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1837)|
| 0:30:43| That's a very small area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1843)|
| 0:30:45| And we're just talking about the slope protection area, not, you know, not the whole county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1845)|
| 0:30:50| And that leaves, I heard 14% of the total citizens and parcels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1850)|
| 0:31:00| leaving, on the other hand, about 86% of the entire county downstream and vulnerable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1860)|
| 0:31:10| You must consider the property rights of this large majority of citizens who reside downhill and are in harm's way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1870)|
| 0:31:17| League members have contacted me to describe hundreds and thousands of dollars of remediation needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1877)|
| 0:31:23| to deal with flooding and drainage problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| One member had to spend $8,000 recently to repair her long driveway that was badly designed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1885)|
| 0:31:31| Another has spent over $20,000 over 12 years dealing with her perpetual problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1891)|
| 0:31:37| I personally deal with constant erosion from my neighbor's irresponsible driveway construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1897)|
| 0:31:42| There are just so many stories that I know you all have heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1902)|
| 0:31:46| Hours and hours of county staff time and city NPC staff time has been spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1906)|
| 0:31:52| helping homeowners who have no recourse after bad development happens and the damage keeps repeating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1912)|
| 0:31:58| So, downhill or not, we're all paying personally and through our tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1918)|
| 0:32:03| So we urge you not to allow the city to stumble backward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1923)|
| 0:32:07| We know that NPC has been using the 15% threshold for making recommendations going on for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1927)|
| 0:32:15| And as it was pointed out, the difference, 15%, it depends over the span of distance you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1935)|
| 0:32:24| But going up to 25%, you're, again, using the example of Walnut Street right here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1944)|
| 0:32:31| right behind the building. I mean, that is, nobody can deny that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1951)|
| 0:32:35| That range, 15% to 25% is huge. That is a very, that can be a dramatically steep slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1955)|
| 0:32:42| I'm sure your intent in commissioning, being a part of the commissioning in the task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1962)|
| 0:32:50| was not giving advantages to the land buyers and developers, but to improve protections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1970)|
| 0:32:54| You all know this plan gives developers the right to develop smaller road widths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1974)|
| 0:32:58| and higher densities than before. So it's a win for them and a win for all of the 80 to 90% of the rest of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1978)|
| 0:33:07| So I'll leave you with this. Please respect your task force's work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1987)|
| 0:33:11| Vote for us, these downhill property owners, and don't cave into fear. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1991)|
| 0:33:18| Thank you very much. I know a couple of council members have to go to other meetings previously scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=1998)|
| 0:33:27| Councilman Roddy. Thank you, Vice Mayor. I do have a prior commitment at seven o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2007)|
| 0:33:31| So I apologize to the remaining speakers, but I'm going to have to excuse myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2011)|
| 0:33:35| Councilman Palmer. I also have a commitment with the neighborhood group who is waiting. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2015)|
| 0:33:40| And we'll have the minutes for you to read if you missed anything as usual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2020)|
| 0:33:45| And so let's continue with the agenda. Mr. Peabody, give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2025)|
| 0:33:50| Thank you. I appreciate that, Vice Mayor. This is Ron Peabody, 625 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2030)|
| 0:33:58| You know, I appreciate the opportunity to speak to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2038)|
| 0:34:06| My involvement with this issue began last fall when a friend of mine was trying to close on a land purchase deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2046)|
| 0:34:17| that involved Park West Hospital. And I'll tie this back in in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2057)|
| 0:34:24| When the engineer for the site, the potential buyer of that property, came down and met with the Metro Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2064)|
| 0:34:32| the MPC office, he was basically told initially that the plan as presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2072)|
| 0:34:40| or the site was going to fall under the new hillside and ridgetop protection plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2080)|
| 0:34:45| And therefore, they could not get started on it at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2085)|
| 0:34:50| Now, subsequent to that, that plan did move forward. That property was purchased and is currently under development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2090)|
| 0:34:59| The reason I was interested in that is the fact that there's a perception that although this is a plan currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2099)|
| 0:35:10| that it will not go into effect until codes are created or some type of an overlay district is created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2110)|
| 0:35:18| or whatever method that the city and the county chooses to enforce this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2118)|
| 0:35:24| My argument here is in fact that in certain instances, MPC staff is already currently enforcing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2124)|
| 0:35:31| or beginning to enforce the guidelines of this plan without the backing of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2131)|
| 0:35:37| That's in my opinion. Now, I'm not an expert here, but simply put, if a developer approaches MPC with a site plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2137)|
| 0:35:46| and that site plan is rejected because it does not fall within the guidelines of this proposed plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2146)|
| 0:35:52| and that began almost ten months ago, that to me from a process standpoint is alarming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2152)|
| 0:36:01| I'd like to address a couple of other things that were said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2161)|
| 0:36:07| There have been some comments, and I'm sorry that Councilwoman Palmer had to leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2167)|
| 0:36:14| but there were some comments about like why the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2174)|
| 0:36:18| asking whether the chamber was involved in the development of the process of this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2178)|
| 0:36:24| Over a two and a half year period, the plan and the task force conducted nine public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2184)|
| 0:36:31| Over that time period, they collected approximately 200 comments from participants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2191)|
| 0:36:38| Now, there were more participants than that that actually attended the meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2198)|
| 0:36:42| but as it's stated in the current version of the plan, 200 comments were collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2202)|
| 0:36:48| Now, that is out of a county population of approximately 440,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2208)|
| 0:36:55| I have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2215)|
| 0:36:56| That is hardly widespread input on a plan that potentially has the type of restrictive policies that this plan will have eventually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2216)|
| 0:37:12| A comment was made earlier about affordable and affordability of housing under this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2232)|
| 0:37:19| One of the areas that is cited regularly by MPC staff and supporters of the plan as a kind of an area that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2239)|
| 0:37:28| or a municipality or a general area that was very proactive about protecting their hillsides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2248)|
| 0:37:35| and ridgetops a while ago was Asheville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| And I want to read a couple of numbers to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2258)|
| 0:37:44| $390,976, that's the average listing price of a home in Asheville, North Carolina, as of last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2264)|
| 0:37:55| That compares to Knoxville's average of $251,715 during the same time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2275)|
| 0:38:04| $175,000, that's the average sales price of a home in Asheville during the first quarter of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2284)|
| 0:38:11| And that compares to Knoxville's average of $99,000 for the same time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2291)|
| 0:38:18| So the average listing price of a home in Asheville last week was 44% higher than here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2298)|
| 0:38:25| And the average sales price of a home, this is a freestanding home in Asheville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2305)|
| 0:38:30| was 77% higher than in Knoxville last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2310)|
| 0:38:36| Councilman Della Volpe asked a very good question about affordability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2316)|
| 0:38:40| And my concern is how does a median income family making $35,000 to $50,000 a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2320)|
| 0:38:49| buy a home that will potentially cost $300,000 to $400,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| Well, I mean, I can answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| They don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| What I'm concerned about, if this plan is implemented as written, currently written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2337)|
| 0:39:03| is that what we're going to be doing is we're going to drive affordable residential housing out of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2343)|
| 0:39:10| They're going to go to Blunt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2350)|
| 0:39:12| They're going to go to, you know, Anderson, Claiborne, Cock, Jefferson, Roan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2352)|
| 0:39:17| because they're going to be able to afford houses there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| The people will go where they can afford houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2360)|
| 0:39:23| And I'm very concerned about that here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2363)|
| 0:39:28| A couple of other things, which I find rather interesting about this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2368)|
| 0:39:32| is that MPC has stated and the plan and the task force co-chairs have stated repeatedly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2372)|
| 0:39:40| that they are not going to notify the potentially affected property owners of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2380)|
| 0:39:49| There are 63,000 parcels that fall under the plan in the overall county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2389)|
| 0:39:58| Considering MPC has an annual budget of $4.3 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2398)|
| 0:40:04| and the task force to date has spent about $340,000 on the plan's creation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2404)|
| 0:40:11| the idea that, according to Mr. Donaldson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| the total cost of about $17,000 could not be spent to directly notify via postcard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2414)|
| 0:40:20| each and every one of the affected property owners to me is just astounding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2420)|
| 0:40:26| And it should be to all of you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2426)|
| 0:40:33| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2433)|
| 0:40:36| I want to reiterate one other thing that one of the previous speakers said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2436)|
| 0:40:41| The bulk of the supporters and much of the argument in favor of this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2441)|
| 0:40:48| is that there is this panacea of new rights that are given to developers and property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2448)|
| 0:40:56| and that there is these density swaps and density bonuses that are available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2456)|
| 0:41:01| But I need to illustrate a very simple thing about this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2461)|
| 0:41:06| Above 25% slope in this plan, 25 to 40%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2466)|
| 0:41:12| according to the plan there is a maximum of 15% clearing available per acre for the lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2472)|
| 0:41:24| So 15% total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2484)|
| 0:41:26| If you match that up with the allowed building sites, to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2486)|
| 0:41:32| now I am not an expert at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2492)|
| 0:41:34| but to me what that means is it's going to be very hard to build anything above 25% slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2494)|
| 0:41:42| under the guidelines of this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2502)|
| 0:41:45| Because if you factor out, I mean, 15% clearance, if it's a wooded area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2505)|
| 0:41:51| I mean, that barely will cover the land needed to build the driveway or the road up the side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2511)|
| 0:41:58| To me, that is one of the unsung things about this plan that has gone very barely even mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2518)|
| 0:42:06| This is a restrictive plan based on clearing, not density bonus allowances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2526)|
| 0:42:14| I want to make one more comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2534)|
| 0:42:17| The whole idea that a property owner will reserve his rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2537)|
| 0:42:22| or will have the ability to add higher density at lower slope levels in their property only works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2542)|
| 0:42:32| if that property owner basically owns from the ridgeline down to property below| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2552)|
| 0:42:39| or at at least 15% slope or below,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2559)|
| 0:42:43| where they can actually effectively trigger the density swap or the higher density at the lower levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2563)|
| 0:42:49| If there's property owned in this county or city where that property owner only owns 25% or above slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2569)|
| 0:42:58| there is no swap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2578)|
| 0:43:00| There is no density bonuses allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2580)|
| 0:43:03| Not only that, that property owner cannot buy land that is lower and use that to swap their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2583)|
| 0:43:10| There's restrictions in the plan that would not allow that from that property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2590)|
| 0:43:14| So in effect, I understand there may not be many of those, but there are going to be some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2594)|
| 0:43:19| How do you tell a property owner in Knox County that maybe has had this land multi-generations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2599)|
| 0:43:25| that all of a sudden their land is now unbuildable or has almost no capability of even building any homes on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2605)|
| 0:43:34| because they have a higher slope than 25% or 30% on their total land and they can't activate the slope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2614)|
| 0:43:41| I'm going to recommend, much like Knox County did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2621)|
| 0:43:46| Knox County Commission voted this plan down on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2626)|
| 0:43:51| I'm going to recommend that city council do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2631)|
| 0:43:55| This plan needs to be rebooted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| All the participants, engineering by the city and the county, city council, county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2637)|
| 0:44:05| developers, builders, realtors, MPC, all the interested parties need to get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2645)|
| 0:44:12| and come up with something that will work for everyone and be a compromise that will work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2652)|
| 0:44:17| and do what this task force was originally tasked to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2657)|
| 0:44:22| which is protect the main ridgelines and provide for security of the main ridgelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2662)|
| 0:44:30| and hillsides in this county, no more, no less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2670)|
| 0:44:34| That's what we require.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2674)|
| 0:44:36| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2676)|
| 0:44:37| Thank you, Mr. Peabody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2677)|
| 0:44:38| David Vandergriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| If you could give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2681)|
| 0:44:46| David Vandergriff, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2686)|
| 0:44:49| I'm speaking to you tonight as chair of the Knoxville Tree Board on behalf of the tree board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2689)|
| 0:44:55| As you all know, our task, one of our main tasks as a tree board, is to be an advisory body to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2695)|
| 0:45:03| So I'm speaking in that capacity this evening, and we recommend that you adopt this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2703)|
| 0:45:10| The tree board has followed the development of this plan very closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2710)|
| 0:45:15| There have been several present and past members of the tree board that served on the task force, including myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2715)|
| 0:45:24| and we talked about it every meeting for the last three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2724)|
| 0:45:29| So the tree board has very closely followed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2729)|
| 0:45:37| I think most of you all know my day job is I'm UT Extension agent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2737)|
| 0:45:41| I'm a certified arborist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2741)|
| 0:45:43| I'm a certified professional horticulturist, so that is my area of expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2743)|
| 0:45:50| We endorse it because it's good science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2750)|
| 0:45:53| It was developed well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| The task force was something that's not been mentioned to any of the bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2755)|
| 0:45:59| The task force was divided into groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2759)|
| 0:46:02| People served on those different groups within the task force based on their experience and expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2762)|
| 0:46:14| I was on the site design committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2774)|
| 0:46:17| The site design committee was this committee that had the city and county folks, engineers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2777)|
| 0:46:23| to provide the technical expertise about the roads, the infrastructure type things, also where the developers were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2783)|
| 0:46:31| I sat between two of our major developers most meetings, Victor Jernigan on one side and Rocky Smith on the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2791)|
| 0:46:40| We had lots of conversations about this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2800)|
| 0:46:47| So their input was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| I can assure you of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2809)|
| 0:46:54| But we do strongly endorse it, feel like it's based on good science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2814)|
| 0:46:59| It protects trees, and that's part of our duty as well is to protect our trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2819)|
| 0:47:09| So a couple of things that I've heard this evening, if I could address and correct some inaccuracies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2829)|
| 0:47:20| Knowing whether or not your property is affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2840)|
| 0:47:24| I never knew there were so many different variations of GIS overlays until we went through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2844)|
| 0:47:29| And we spent lots and lots of time looking at all sorts of different scenarios to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2849)|
| 0:47:36| And one of the things that we, and we used other information from other places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2856)|
| 0:47:43| but one of the things that seemed like a really good idea that MPC would use with the KGIS system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2863)|
| 0:47:49| is one that Asheville uses where whenever you go to that system and look up that plat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2869)|
| 0:47:55| if it falls within this zone, it will automatically pop up and tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2875)|
| 0:48:00| It's inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2880)|
| 0:48:01| So there's no guesswork there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2881)|
| 0:48:03| You'll know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2883)|
| 0:48:04| It's a much more accurate way than what's being used now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2884)|
| 0:48:07| So that's one point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2887)|
| 0:48:10| This issue of slopes and affordability, as I said, I sat between two developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2890)|
| 0:48:15| They said during the whole process, almost every meeting, I heard the same comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2895)|
| 0:48:21| We don't want to develop slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2901)|
| 0:48:23| It's too expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| We'd rather, you know, and part of their argument was they were saying we need to develop all of our flat land and our farm land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2905)|
| 0:48:32| And, of course, I'm an agriculture agent too, so I went in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2912)|
| 0:48:36| But that tells you that cheap affordable housing is not going to be on the slope because the costs are too high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2916)|
| 0:48:45| So that's really a misstatement that it's going to take affordable housing out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2925)|
| 0:48:50| No matter what you build, it's more expensive to build on the slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2930)|
| 0:48:54| And both of them all through the process said every time, we don't want to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2934)|
| 0:48:58| It's too expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2938)|
| 0:49:01| Fire protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2941)|
| 0:49:02| We spend a lot of time on fire protection too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2942)|
| 0:49:04| And whenever the recommendations were made about the road widths and things, fire protection was certainly factored into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2944)|
| 0:49:11| The Firewise standards, which is a voluntary program to enable fire protection to be more adequately provided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2951)|
| 0:49:22| was certainly one of the considerations and was part of the guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2962)|

| 0:49:37| Council Delvopi, you brought that up about the way we develop now, is it different than before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2977)|
| 0:49:45| I have a friend that's a father who's now passed away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2985)|
| 0:49:48| As a young man, I talked about grading roads in Sequoia Hills with a mule and a pan scraper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2988)|
| 0:49:56| Well, whenever you did that, you didn't have the impact with the equipment that you use today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=2996)|
| 0:50:00| And certainly they had more modern equipment then too, but John spent some time with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3000)|
| 0:50:06| because it wasn't all done the way it is now for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3006)|
| 0:50:16| Protecting trees has many impacts for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3016)|
| 0:50:22| The more impervious surface, the more runoff, the more stormwater problems, the less canopy cover, the more heat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3022)|
| 0:50:29| We are striving for 40% canopy cover in the city, and the inner city area is 25% as we go out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3029)|
| 0:50:40| We have, as you all know, we're in the process of completing a tree inventory for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3040)|
| 0:50:48| And preliminary data is in, and one of the things that it's showing us that we need to be concerned about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3048)|
| 0:50:54| is that we have about 3% large trees in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3054)|
| 0:51:01| It's a very small amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3061)|
| 0:51:03| We've got a lot of small trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3063)|
| 0:51:05| We don't even have a lot of medium-sized trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3065)|
| 0:51:09| And something that we've all seen this week, and as a professional arborist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3069)|
| 0:51:16| I've been looking at the causes of this, tree failures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3076)|
| 0:51:20| We see them everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3080)|
| 0:51:22| I've seen tree failures that have occurred from all the different ways that trees fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3082)|
| 0:51:28| But there's one that sticks out more so than any of the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3088)|
| 0:51:34| There's more of them than I've seen that it's the cause of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3094)|
| 0:51:37| and that is the impact of activity, not just development, activity on roots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3097)|
| 0:51:45| Because what happens whenever you impact roots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3105)|
| 0:51:48| Nothing happens right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3108)|
| 0:51:50| And, of course, we can't see tree roots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3110)|
| 0:51:52| They're invisible to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3112)|
| 0:51:54| Even the roots you can see from the surface, you can't tell if they're decayed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3114)|
| 0:51:58| because decay on roots starts on the bottom side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3118)|
| 0:52:01| So if you're looking down at an exposed root, you can't tell it's decayed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3121)|
| 0:52:06| The decay's taking place in the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3126)|
| 0:52:08| But if you notice a lot of these trees that have failed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3128)|
| 0:52:12| and are on houses and cars and different places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3132)|
| 0:52:16| you know they're root failures whenever you look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3136)|
| 0:52:19| There's no ball of dirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| There's essentially no roots that come up with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3141)|
| 0:52:25| And the base is rotted because of the decay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3145)|
| 0:52:27| or move from the roots up into the base of the tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3147)|
| 0:52:30| Then you get the right conditions as trees are over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3150)|
| 0:52:33| It takes many years for this to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3153)|
| 0:52:36| It's nothing that happens the next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| A lot of times it's 5, 10, 15 years down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3158)|
| 0:52:41| But we're seeing the effects of impacts on root systems now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3161)|
| 0:52:47| So to me as an arborist and us as the tree board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3167)|
| 0:52:51| the restrictions on the amount of the site that can be cleared is extremely important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3171)|
| 0:52:59| Now, to correct what was just said about those clearing reductions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3179)|
| 0:53:05| if it's a 0 to 15% slope, you can clear 100% of the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3185)|
| 0:53:10| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3190)|
| 0:53:11| If it's 15 to 25%, you can clear half the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3191)|
| 0:53:17| 25 to 40%, 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3197)|
| 0:53:20| 45 to 50, 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3200)|
| 0:53:23| And 50 and above, that's the one area that's prohibited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3203)|
| 0:53:26| But we certainly don't need to develop anything on slopes greater than 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3206)|
| 0:53:32| So on behalf of the tree board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3212)|
| 0:53:35| our recommendation is that you adopt this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3215)|
| 0:53:38| And if any of you all have any questions, I'd be happy to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3218)|
| 0:53:42| Real quick, how many members are on the tree board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3222)|
| 0:53:48| There's about 15 of us all together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3228)|
| 0:53:50| You know what the vote was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3230)|
| 0:53:52| There are voting members and there's ex-officio members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3232)|
| 0:53:54| So total we're about 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3234)|
| 0:53:58| You know what the vote was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| Unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3240)|
| 0:54:01| Unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3241)|
| 0:54:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3242)|
| 0:54:03| Mr. Adams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3243)|
| 0:54:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3244)|
| 0:54:05| Mr. Vandergrift, I represent the 5th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3245)|
| 0:54:08| and you may know that it's a district that's probably been hit as bad by flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3248)|
| 0:54:13| as almost any in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3253)|
| 0:54:14| The single most complaints that I get are about flooding in the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3254)|
| 0:54:20| and in urban areas where there's housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3260)|
| 0:54:22| How do you see the adoption of this plan impacting that significantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3262)|
| 0:54:28| or just I guess to the amount of degree the adoption of this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3268)|
| 0:54:34| would help in flooding in the inner city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3274)|
| 0:54:37| I think it would have a significant increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3277)|
| 0:54:40| You know, inside the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3280)|
| 0:54:42| our flooding problems aren't all produced within the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3282)|
| 0:54:47| A lot of that's water that moves from the county in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3287)|
| 0:54:50| So in my opinion, it would have a significant increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3290)|
| 0:54:54| You know, I'm a Fountain City native.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3294)|
| 0:54:56| It's where I grew up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3296)|
| 0:54:58| So I'm well aware of flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3298)|
| 0:55:01| I live in Halls currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3301)|
| 0:55:03| I saw Beaver Creek this morning out of its bank and Chocolate Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3303)|
| 0:55:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3308)|
| 0:55:09| We've also talked some about maybe varying the percentage of slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3309)|
| 0:55:14| as far as maybe adjusting the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3314)|
| 0:55:18| 15% to 25% to the eye doesn't look like that much of a slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3318)|
| 0:55:24| Water, 15% and up to 25% is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3324)|
| 0:55:28| What's your opinion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3328)|
| 0:55:31| Well, slope certainly has an impact with flooding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3331)|
| 0:55:36| both from quantity and velocity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3336)|
| 0:55:40| You know, the steeper the slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3340)|
| 0:55:42| This is all graduated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3342)|
| 0:55:43| It just makes good common sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3343)|
| 0:55:47| and it certainly is based on good science that as slope increases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3347)|
| 0:55:52| you need to disturb less ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| You know, part of the impervious surfaces that we have problems with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3354)|
| 0:55:58| are not all roofs and drives and parking lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3358)|
| 0:56:02| and those type of things that we automatically think of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3362)|
| 0:56:06| But whenever you do a lot of activity on a site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3366)|
| 0:56:11| particularly whenever you're disturbing 100% of the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3371)|
| 0:56:15| and you compact the soil to a bulk density that's the same as this concrete here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3375)|
| 0:56:20| you don't have water infiltration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3380)|
| 0:56:21| You have water runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3381)|
| 0:56:23| And that is a huge problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3383)|
| 0:56:26| And I see that every day as an extension agent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3386)|
| 0:56:29| You know, that's my day job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3389)|
| 0:56:30| I deal with day after day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3390)|
| 0:56:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3392)|
| 0:56:33| Even with slopes as little as 15% to 25%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3393)|
| 0:56:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3397)|
| 0:56:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3399)|
| 0:56:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3400)|
| 0:56:41| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3401)|
| 0:56:43| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3403)|
| 0:56:48| I believe that's the last of the speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3408)|
| 0:56:50| I mean, people have signed up to speak, isn't it, Mr. Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3410)|
| 0:56:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3414)|
| 0:56:55| Well, I just want to thank you all for taking the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| I know you're down to three council members now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| but I appreciate you all hanging in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3419)|
| 0:57:03| Councilman Thomas and Councilman Della Voppe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3423)|
| 0:57:06| and, of course, Vice Mayor Bailey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3426)|
| 0:57:07| and the others that were here that had to leave already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3427)|
| 0:57:09| But thank you for taking the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3429)|
| 0:57:12| You've heard a lot of interesting comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3432)|
| 0:57:15| I won't go into rebuttal, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3435)|
| 0:57:19| We'll deal with that at a later date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3439)|
| 0:57:22| I put the resolution up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3442)|
| 0:57:24| We're not going to go into that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3444)|
| 0:57:25| We don't have time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3445)|
| 0:57:26| But we'll try to get you copies when this comes up for a vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3446)|
| 0:57:30| so you'll have that in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| Because you heard that this task force overstepped, overreached, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3452)|
| 0:57:38| We did exactly what this council asked us to do in county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3458)|
| 0:57:42| And when you read the joint resolution, I think you'll appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3462)|
| 0:57:47| So with that, I just want to, again, thank you for taking the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3467)|
| 0:57:52| And if you have any further questions, of course, I'd be glad to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3472)|
| 0:57:56| But I know you want to get out of here, and I think everybody does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3476)|
| 0:57:59| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3479)|
| 0:58:01| Thank you, Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3481)|
| 0:58:03| And I'd like to ask, is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3483)|
| 0:58:06| Normally, you know, we would have a discussion, preliminary discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3486)|
| 0:58:10| leading into the council meeting, which we'll look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3490)|
| 0:58:17| Ranks are kind of thin right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop110428part2?start=3497)|
