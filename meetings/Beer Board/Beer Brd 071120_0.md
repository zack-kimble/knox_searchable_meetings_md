| 0:06:14| Sean Blair, 5117 Ridgemont, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=374)|
| 0:06:18| Officer Husky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=378)|
| 0:06:20| City court records indicate he's got a selda underage conviction in 1999.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=380)|
| 0:06:28| I had one in 1998 with dismissed with court costs and 10 to alcohol class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=388)|
| 0:06:52| Ms. Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=412)|
| 0:06:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=413)|
| 0:06:54| We're waiting on the sales tax registration, a copy of the corporate charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=414)|
| 0:06:57| approval from the health department task program certification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=417)|
| 0:07:01| and a final business tax return from the former owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=421)|
| 0:07:07| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=427)|
| 0:07:09| Mr. Blair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=429)|
| 0:07:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=430)|
| 0:07:11| Over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=431)|
| 0:07:13| The selda underage that you have on your record, the last one was in 99.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=433)|
| 0:07:17| There's one in 98 and another one in 99.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=437)|
| 0:07:21| Have you been serving in any capacity in this kind of business since then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=441)|
| 0:07:26| Have you been in a position to serve alcohol?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=446)|
| 0:07:30| Oh, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=450)|
| 0:07:32| Actually, when I first joined Manhattans with Frank back in, I guess it was 98, 99,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=452)|
| 0:07:38| I had just started with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=458)|
| 0:07:41| And then I became a manager because I came from a different background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=461)|
| 0:07:44| I've had a beer license previously in 96, 97, and 98.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=464)|
| 0:07:48| And I started them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=468)|
| 0:07:50| And he didn't have the door people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=470)|
| 0:07:52| He had, like, his daughter working the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=472)|
| 0:07:53| And so, since then, we've brought in security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=473)|
| 0:07:55| And for the past five years, I've been general manager of Patrick's, Lucille's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=475)|
| 0:08:00| Backroom Barbecue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=480)|
| 0:08:01| And I've got a few things that, you know, we've been in and checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=481)|
| 0:08:05| And, I mean, I'm sure they know as well as I have how many times we've been in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=485)|
| 0:08:08| and passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=488)|
| 0:08:10| So, since this is a very old record, it appears that you had a good record since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=490)|
| 0:08:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=494)|
| 0:08:15| I'd hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=495)|
| 0:08:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=496)|
| 0:08:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=497)|
| 0:08:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=498)|
| 0:08:20| Councilman Pilo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=500)|
| 0:08:21| Well, I just had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=501)|
| 0:08:22| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=502)|
| 0:08:23| Manhattans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=503)|
| 0:08:24| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=504)|
| 0:08:25| Close out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=505)|
| 0:08:26| Manhattans is to close out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=506)|
| 0:08:28| I'm going to attempt to purchase it from Frank, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=508)|
| 0:08:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=511)|
| 0:08:32| But you plan to retain the name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=512)|
| 0:08:34| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=514)|
| 0:08:36| I've been there since, yeah, since the inception when we took over in 98.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=516)|
| 0:08:45| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=525)|
| 0:08:58| Let me ask you, sir, you've still been involved in serving at College Barrier since the last,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=538)|
| 0:09:04| since 98, 99, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=544)|
| 0:09:06| In a management capacity, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=546)|
| 0:09:08| In a management capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=548)|
| 0:09:09| When was the last time you attended one of the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=549)|
| 0:09:14| I just got another five-year card just last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=554)|
| 0:09:19| It'll be my fifth ABC card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=559)|
| 0:09:22| Since you've had problems before, what do you plan on doing to make sure that as you take over the management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=562)|
| 0:09:28| of this restaurant and ensuring that there will be no sales to underage individuals or cadets?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=568)|
| 0:09:33| Good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=573)|
| 0:09:36| In 99, when this all happened, I had talked to Frank, and we had actually, since 01 and 02, we have security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=576)|
| 0:09:44| I mean, we have an ex-military private eye that runs security for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=584)|
| 0:09:49| You know, we have personnel at the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=589)|
| 0:09:51| And in the last, you know, four to five years, I feel very confident in our building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=591)|
| 0:09:55| what we've done at Manhattan's, at Patrick Sullivan's, and at Lucille's in taking care of these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=595)|
| 0:10:01| And I couldn't tell you how many times they've been in to check us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=601)|
| 0:10:04| because Knoxville Police Department doesn't write us letters like the ABC does from the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=604)|
| 0:10:09| I do have a few of those letters where they come in and they try to, you know, catch you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=609)|
| 0:10:14| and they write you a letter and say thank you for doing your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=614)|
| 0:10:17| And so, you know, for the past four or five years, it's been a stellar record, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=617)|
| 0:10:23| And what's been your official title?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=623)|
| 0:10:25| You say you've been in management the last couple of years with Manhattan's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=625)|
| 0:10:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=628)|
| 0:10:29| Would you have been like the assistant manager?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=629)|
| 0:10:33| No, I guess I'd be the general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=633)|
| 0:10:35| Been a general manager?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=635)|
| 0:10:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=636)|
| 0:10:37| And hadn't had any underage sales or anybody under your employee had any underage sales since you've been managing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=637)|
| 0:10:43| Not to my knowledge, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=643)|
| 0:10:46| You said you mentioned Lucille's also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=646)|
| 0:10:48| Uh-huh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=648)|
| 0:10:49| Any problems at Lucille's over the last, since 1999?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=649)|
| 0:10:52| Oh, I'm sure since 1999.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=652)|
| 0:10:54| We purchased that property, I'd have to look at the records, probably in 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=654)|
| 0:10:59| And it was Lucille's for six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=659)|
| 0:11:01| Well, what about since you've had it since 2005?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=661)|
| 0:11:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=663)|
| 0:11:05| To my knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=665)|
| 0:11:08| Councilor McLaughlin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=668)|
| 0:11:09| Thank you, Chairman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=669)|
| 0:11:10| I'd like to call on Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=670)|
| 0:11:14| I seem to recall that there is some length of time prohibition for a business person to serve as an owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=674)|
| 0:11:20| or perhaps a manager if they have a sale to underage conviction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=680)|
| 0:11:23| Could you clarify that for the Beer Board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=683)|
| 0:11:25| Section 4-37 of the code with regard to the qualifications of permittees and employees provides that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=685)|
| 0:11:33| no permittees shall be a person who has been convicted of any violation of any ordinance related to the possession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=693)|
| 0:11:40| sale, manufacture, or transportation of beer, da-da-da-da, within the last 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=700)|
| 0:11:47| No permittees shall employ a person involved in the sale of beer who has been convicted of any violation of any ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=707)|
| 0:11:53| related to the sale, storage, possession with intent to resale or redistribute, manufacture, or transportation of beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=713)|
| 0:12:00| The employee is disqualified for a period of one year on the first offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=720)|
| 0:12:05| for a period of three years on the second offense, and 10 years on the third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=725)|
| 0:12:09| So a permittee is not eligible for 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=729)|
| 0:12:13| So that would indicate that this is not an application that we are empowered to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=733)|
| 0:12:18| It is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=738)|
| 0:12:19| Not if there is a conviction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=739)|
| 0:12:21| That would be what our records check would indicate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=741)|
| 0:12:24| There is a conviction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=744)|
| 0:12:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=746)|
| 0:12:29| Conviction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=749)|
| 0:12:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=750)|
| 0:12:31| I did not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=751)|
| 0:12:33| I just had a question for Mr. Blair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=753)|
| 0:12:36| Blair, yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=756)|
| 0:12:37| Are you on the permit now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=757)|
| 0:12:39| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=759)|
| 0:12:40| Well, I think that's probably the reason this hasn't come to anyone's attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=760)|
| 0:12:44| I didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=764)|
| 0:12:45| Sorry to waste your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=765)|
| 0:12:47| Counselman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=767)|
| 0:12:48| And, Ms. Swanson, pleading guilty is conviction, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=768)|
| 0:12:52| Not necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=772)|
| 0:12:53| You can plead guilty and get a diversion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=773)|
| 0:12:55| but there's nothing in this record that indicates that there is a diversionary sentence here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=775)|
| 0:12:59| that the only thing that I see here is a plea of guilty, and I assume that accompanies a conviction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=779)|
| 0:13:05| Now, if he could show that he pled guilty as a result of which he received a diversionary sentence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=785)|
| 0:13:11| then he would be eligible for a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=791)|
| 0:13:14| But unless, and the burden is on him to show that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=794)|
| 0:13:17| And the way you read it, it was no person convicted, this shall be issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=797)|
| 0:13:21| This is not a. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=801)|
| 0:13:22| It's mandatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=802)|
| 0:13:24| It's consistent with state law, as a matter of fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=804)|
| 0:13:27| Is there any. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=807)|
| 0:13:30| Let me clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=810)|
| 0:13:31| He had a cell to underage in 8-2 of 98.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=811)|
| 0:13:35| It got dismissed with court calls in the alcohol class, but he had one in 1-30 of 99 is a conviction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=815)|
| 0:13:43| And that come down on 8-4 of 99.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=823)|
| 0:13:45| Let me ask you very quickly so I'm real clear, Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=825)|
| 0:13:51| with regards to the difference between permit to an employee and the prohibition for 1-year, 3-year, 2-years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=831)|
| 0:13:59| Does that apply to your status as. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=839)|
| 0:14:02| When does the status apply?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=842)|
| 0:14:04| When you get the actual violation or does the status label apply when you apply for a beer permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=844)|
| 0:14:11| So my question is if you get it as an employee and seven or eight years later apply for a beer permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=851)|
| 0:14:18| you're then a permittee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=858)|
| 0:14:19| Does it apply then or do you apply?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=859)|
| 0:14:22| Yes, it applies then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=862)|
| 0:14:23| No one within a 10-year period of conviction may be a permittee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=863)|
| 0:14:27| If that person is within 10 years of having been convicted of any of those offenses, that person is not eligible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=867)|
| 0:14:35| When I heard you talk about employee 1-year, 3-year, I was wondering how that really fit in the matrix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=875)|
| 0:14:41| But this is a permittee, which is a different thing altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=881)|
| 0:14:44| It doesn't matter if he was an employee when he had the violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=884)|
| 0:14:47| The question is now that he's a permittee, it applies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=887)|
| 0:14:50| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=890)|
| 0:14:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=891)|
| 0:14:54| Well, apparently we cannot issue you a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=894)|
| 0:14:57| And I totally respect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=897)|
| 0:14:59| I understand that I need to go back to when I went to court and was told to plead guilty for that fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=899)|
| 0:15:06| because I think what you just told me about diversionary was the reason or else I never would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=906)|
| 0:15:12| because it was a door situation where, I mean, regardless of the circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=912)|
| 0:15:17| but obviously I was not informed of that or had that paperwork with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=917)|
| 0:15:23| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=923)|
| 0:15:25| So it sounds like that's what you need to do is just check out whatever transpired back at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=925)|
| 0:15:33| Councilman Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=933)|
| 0:15:34| Is there any value in us postponing this for you to check this out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=934)|
| 0:15:38| Yes, sir, definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=938)|
| 0:15:41| I can get it resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=941)|
| 0:15:43| I would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=943)|
| 0:15:44| I do not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=944)|
| 0:15:45| I'll move to postpone it to the next scheduled beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=945)|
| 0:15:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=949)|
| 0:15:50| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=953)|
| 0:15:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=954)|
| 0:15:55| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=955)|
| 0:15:57| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=957)|
| 0:15:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=958)|
| 0:15:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=959)|
| 0:16:04| Let me on that postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=964)|
| 0:16:05| Excuse me, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=965)|
| 0:16:07| Can I make a request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=967)|
| 0:16:08| If you determine that the record indicates exactly what we have here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=968)|
| 0:16:12| and there's nothing in the record that indicates that it should have been a diversion of any sort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=972)|
| 0:16:19| could you let the beer board office know so that maybe there wouldn't even be any need to put it on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=979)|
| 0:16:25| I'd be glad to, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=985)|
| 0:16:26| That would save you from having to come down here also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=986)|
| 0:16:28| Yes, I don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=988)|
| 0:16:29| Because what would have to happen is when you have them pull that particular ticket,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=989)|
| 0:16:32| it would need to be written on there or in their file somewhere that this was going to be a guilty plea to be dismissed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=992)|
| 0:16:39| after a certain number of days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=999)|
| 0:16:40| And if that's not on the document, then, you know, there's no need, I guess, to go down that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1000)|
| 0:16:44| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1004)|
| 0:16:45| Yes, I'll put it in the comments, Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1005)|
| 0:16:46| I'll find out immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1006)|
| 0:16:47| Yes, comments, Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1007)|
| 0:16:49| Whoever handled it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1009)|
| 0:16:50| Yes, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1010)|
| 0:16:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1011)|
| 0:16:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1012)|
| 0:17:03| Could you give us your name and address, please, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1023)|
| 0:17:05| Michael Penrod, 231 East Baxter, Knoxville, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1025)|
| 0:17:14| The applicant has an open beer consumption violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1034)|
| 0:17:18| He received a 9-2207, but it is still pending in city court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1038)|
| 0:17:24| Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1044)|
| 0:17:26| Waiting on approval from the Fire Inspector and Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1046)|
| 0:17:33| Counsel from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1053)|
| 0:17:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1055)|
| 0:17:36| Concerning his currently pending charges, on his application he indicated DUI,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1056)|
| 0:17:42| but what was read was an open container violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1062)|
| 0:17:47| Did I hear that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1067)|
| 0:17:49| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1069)|
| 0:17:51| He has the, under other information, he has a DUI still pending that he got on 9-2207.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1071)|
| 0:18:01| He wrote on his application that he did receive that DUI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1081)|
| 0:18:05| He expected it to be dismissed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1085)|
| 0:18:08| Okay, but you mentioned an open container.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1088)|
| 0:18:11| He just received that on 9-2207, and it's still pending in city court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1091)|
| 0:18:16| Was that the same day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1096)|
| 0:18:18| It appears to be the same day he got a DUI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1098)|
| 0:18:23| Counsel from Raleigh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1103)|
| 0:18:25| I had a question about this location, since I'm not familiar with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1105)|
| 0:18:29| I noticed in our supplementary information packet the certificate of zoning is there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1109)|
| 0:18:33| and this is in an I-2 zone, an industrial zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1113)|
| 0:18:38| and I know that that's a zone where beer permits are kind of issued use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1118)|
| 0:18:44| if they are auxiliary uses, other uses in that zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1124)|
| 0:18:47| Is that right, Mr. Swenson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1127)|
| 0:18:49| The issue with I-2 is whether or not the commercial use is a use that is in conjunction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1129)|
| 0:18:58| with the industrial use of the property, or of the area, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1138)|
| 0:19:04| Since I'm not familiar with this location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1144)|
| 0:19:06| is there someone else on counsel who can speak to whether or not that would be the case for this location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1146)|
| 0:19:16| Well, I guess this is a debate we've had several times about an ancillary use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1156)|
| 0:19:20| It would depend on what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1160)|
| 0:19:25| Isn't there a bar there now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1165)|
| 0:19:27| Yes, there has been for 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1167)|
| 0:19:29| Since there's a BW's that is closing out or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1169)|
| 0:19:35| If I might, I spoke with Mr. Charlie Wilson at the zoning, I guess it is, and they did check into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1175)|
| 0:19:45| We did get a zoning letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| He did confirm that it was industrial use, that it had been a bar for over 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1187)|
| 0:19:55| It's irrelevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1195)|
| 0:19:56| All indications was that there was no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1196)|
| 0:19:59| If I might address the previous issue from the police department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1199)|
| 0:20:03| my understanding that open container was dismissed recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1203)|
| 0:20:08| It may not have been as of today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1208)|
| 0:20:10| That was received at the exact same time as the DUI, which was a .09.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1210)|
| 0:20:17| I'm 59 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1217)|
| 0:20:21| I'm 59 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1221)|
| 0:20:22| I've never had a DUI or even a – I don't even think I've had a traffic citation in 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1222)|
| 0:20:29| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1229)|
| 0:20:31| I was actually going to ask, well, you were charged with DUI and it was dismissed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1231)|
| 0:20:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1236)|
| 0:20:38| Just the open container.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| They are both still pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1240)|
| 0:20:41| Both still pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1241)|
| 0:20:42| He put on his application and expected to be dismissed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1245)|
| 0:20:46| They're both still pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1246)|
| 0:20:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1247)|
| 0:20:49| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1249)|
| 0:20:50| Oh, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1250)|
| 0:20:52| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1252)|
| 0:20:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1253)|
| 0:20:54| Just to – I'll repeat a conversation I had with Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1254)|
| 0:20:57| He has disclosed his current situation, and Mr. Swanson, that's correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1257)|
| 0:21:02| that he cannot be denied based on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1262)|
| 0:21:06| Neither of the offenses that I've heard mentioned are offenses that would serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1266)|
| 0:21:10| as an appropriate predicate for denying a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1270)|
| 0:21:18| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1278)|
| 0:21:19| I'll move approval pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1282)|
| 0:21:23| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1283)|
| 0:21:25| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1285)|
| 0:21:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1287)|

| 0:21:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1291)|
| 0:21:32| Could I also say all documentation, as far as I understood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1292)|
| 0:21:35| was turned in as of today by Ms. Wanda Day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1295)|
| 0:21:39| Every one of them have been out, and I do have copies right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1299)|
| 0:21:43| Just come over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1303)|
| 0:21:49| I'll be back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1309)|

| 0:22:22| I have all that, Your Honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1342)|
| 0:22:32| She says she has all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1352)|
| 0:22:33| Do you want to move it to the back of the meeting and see if we can figure out if she has?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1353)|
| 0:22:38| Typically, they don't give it to her until they see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1358)|
| 0:22:46| Well, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1366)|
| 0:22:50| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1370)|
| 0:22:51| Would you like to make a motion of any kind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1371)|
| 0:22:52| I'll move approval pending the final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1372)|
| 0:22:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1376)|
| 0:22:57| Joe, do you want to say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1377)|
| 0:23:00| In discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1380)|
| 0:23:04| Well, I don't think there's any way that we can deny this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1384)|
| 0:23:09| and I don't have any problem with the applicant as far as I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1389)|
| 0:23:14| I was curious as to what your relationship is with the previous owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1394)|
| 0:23:20| Is there any connection between you and the previous owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1400)|
| 0:23:22| Have you worked there before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1402)|
| 0:23:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1404)|
| 0:23:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| I'm a little reluctant to even say that, but there have been some problems with this particular location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1407)|
| 0:23:32| There's been trouble in paradise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1412)|
| 0:23:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1414)|
| 0:23:35| There was a lot of trouble before, but since we took over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1415)|
| 0:23:38| and they've seen that we're cleaning it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1418)|
| 0:23:41| and we've done the deli and everything, the business has been really picking up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1421)|
| 0:23:46| and we've been carding them and IDing everybody, and so we've had no problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1426)|
| 0:23:52| Who's the actual owner of the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1432)|
| 0:23:55| Buddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1435)|

| 0:23:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1439)|
| 0:24:00| I call him Buddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| While you're looking that up, since the council knows this is smack dab in the middle of South Waterfront| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1442)|
| 0:24:08| redevelopment area, and there have been problems that some have associated with this particular location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1448)|
| 0:24:16| including prostitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1456)|
| 0:24:23| But, you know, I mean, new owner, and we can't deny it, and so new start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1463)|
| 0:24:28| We hope you do great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1468)|
| 0:24:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1470)|
| 0:24:31| Well, I guess, you know, based on some of this history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1471)|
| 0:24:35| Ma'am, based on some of the history that's been mentioned and that you're aware of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1475)|
| 0:24:41| you have determined that you want to keep the same name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1481)|
| 0:24:45| We want to keep Paradise Chevron.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1485)|
| 0:24:47| We've changed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1487)|
| 0:24:48| It was Aloha Paradise Chevron, but we've changed it to Paradise Food Market and Deli.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1488)|
| 0:24:55| And it's, I mean, the police have came out and talked to us about the vagrants that stayed there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1495)|
| 0:25:03| and about the prostitution and all of that, and we've discussed it with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1503)|
| 0:25:08| and any time that anything is on the premises, we call in for assistance, and they come out and ask to remove them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1508)|
| 0:25:16| Well, I just say good luck to you because it appears to me that you will continue to track those individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1516)|
| 0:25:26| who created the problems earlier for an earlier owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1526)|
| 0:25:30| I think that's something that really, you know, needs to be seriously considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1530)|
| 0:25:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1534)|
| 0:25:35| Or you may find yourself in an unfortunate position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1535)|
| 0:25:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1538)|
| 0:25:39| Just my philosophy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1539)|
| 0:25:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1542)|
| 0:25:46| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| Go for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1547)|
| 0:25:49| You said you've cleaned things up or are cleaning things up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1549)|
| 0:25:54| What do you mean by that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1554)|
| 0:25:57| You know, we've, there's been a lot of alcohol that was the prostitutions coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1557)|
| 0:26:04| We've had the companies from across the street come over and say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1564)|
| 0:26:09| we have a lot of vagrants coming over here buying beer, coming over here sitting down and drinking it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1569)|
| 0:26:14| And Knoxville Bolton Screw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1574)|
| 0:26:16| Yeah, Knoxville Bolton Screw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1576)|
| 0:26:17| Overhead door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1577)|
| 0:26:18| Boasting gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1578)|
| 0:26:19| And we explain to them, you know, when they come in there and buy that you cannot, you have to take this home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1579)|
| 0:26:26| You can't drink this here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1586)|
| 0:26:27| You can't drink it across the street and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1587)|
| 0:26:31| And the prostitution, we just, we don't allow it at our store, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1591)|
| 0:26:35| If they come in and they try to solicit customers, we just make them leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1595)|
| 0:26:41| It's just not tolerated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1603)|
| 0:26:44| Because that's very bad business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1604)|
| 0:26:46| Well, and it's, again, this is smack dab in the middle of the south waterfront development area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1606)|
| 0:26:52| And I would hope that everybody involved, that you, that the property owners, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1612)|
| 0:26:59| would take the potential negative impacts of this sort of thing very seriously because we do as a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1619)|
| 0:27:05| And I would point out to council, I did look up the ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1625)|
| 0:27:08| This is Baxter Properties owns this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1628)|
| 0:27:11| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1631)|
| 0:27:15| Are we ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1635)|
| 0:27:17| I've heard Baxter called Buddy before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1637)|
| 0:27:19| That's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1639)|
| 0:27:20| Well, the guy that came out is Buddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| I call him Buddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1642)|
| 0:27:23| I believe that's Buddy Staples that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| Whatever that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1651)|
| 0:27:33| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1653)|
| 0:27:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1654)|
| 0:27:35| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1655)|
| 0:27:36| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1656)|
| 0:27:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1657)|

| 0:28:42| Officer Husky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1722)|
| 0:28:43| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1723)|
| 0:28:44| Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1724)|
| 0:28:47| We're still waiting on approval from the building inspector and fire inspector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1727)|
| 0:28:52| and as you and I discussed prior to the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1732)|
| 0:28:55| there is a question about what the accurate address was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1735)|
| 0:28:58| and this was not advertised with the right address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1738)|
| 0:29:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1744)|
| 0:29:05| And what she's referring to is, is my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| and correct me if I misstate this, that MPC issued the wrong address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1748)|
| 0:29:14| and they filled out all the paperwork and everything to the wrong address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1754)|
| 0:29:18| still in the same center, but the wrong address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1758)|
| 0:29:22| And it was posted, if I'm correct, the permit, the notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1762)|
| 0:29:29| but the measurements were taken from a different location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1769)|
| 0:29:33| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1773)|
| 0:29:34| Did I state that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1774)|
| 0:29:35| I believe you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1775)|
| 0:29:37| The application said that the address was 11038,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1777)|
| 0:29:43| and it turns out it's actually 11308.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1783)|
| 0:29:47| And I can't explain to you if there's any effect on the measurements from that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1787)|
| 0:29:52| or not, although it is set squarely in a highly commercial area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1792)|
| 0:29:57| It's in the middle of Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1797)|
| 0:29:59| So, Councilman Pilo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1799)|
| 0:30:02| Well, I think Councilman Frost said his line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1802)|
| 0:30:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1804)|
| 0:30:05| Well, I was just going to comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1805)|
| 0:30:07| it is immediately adjacent to another parcel on which the copper cellar is located,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1807)|
| 0:30:15| and this is a second restaurant, which is being developed there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1815)|
| 0:30:21| and by also Mike Chase and his partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1821)|
| 0:30:25| So, it's kind of a bizarre thing, and we were discussing it earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1825)|
| 0:30:30| because the copper cellar has a Turkey Cove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| Did I do that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| The Calhoun's has a Turkey Cove Lane address right next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1835)|
| 0:30:40| So, the Calhoun's has one address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| This one has a Parkside address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1844)|
| 0:30:46| And, unfortunately, someone at MPC gave them the wrong street number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1846)|
| 0:30:53| Consequently, all of their paperwork was filed under that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| Today it was corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| Is that correct, Mr. Newell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1858)|
| 0:30:59| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1859)|
| 0:31:00| Would you like to comment on how it was corrected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1860)|
| 0:31:03| I just noticed in the paperwork that the plot that MPC had in the documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1863)|
| 0:31:08| was not the piece of property that the building was sitting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1868)|
| 0:31:11| And in noticing that, I started pulling out all the documents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1871)|
| 0:31:14| and I had two documents from MPC, one that said 11-308 and another one that said 11-038.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1874)|
| 0:31:20| So, we immediately got on the phone and came down to the MPC this morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1880)|
| 0:31:24| and got it straightened out and got the official document that it is 11-308.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1884)|
| 0:31:28| Somebody in one of the departments issued the wrong address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| or issued the right address but on the wrong piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1892)|
| 0:31:37| Councilman Cross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1897)|
| 0:31:38| I noticed that the information given to us says 11-038 Parkside Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1898)|
| 0:31:46| When are you shooting to open, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1906)|
| 0:31:49| December 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1909)|
| 0:31:56| Depending on how the second district representative feels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1916)|
| 0:31:58| we can call for a special beer board meeting five minutes before the next city council meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1918)|
| 0:32:06| to address this situation if Mr. Swanson says there are other steps that can't be taken care of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1926)|
| 0:32:12| to remedy the situation tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| Mr. Swanson, would you help us with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1934)|
| 0:32:19| Well, I frankly think the citizens have elected you as members of the beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1939)|
| 0:32:25| to make these kinds of decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| I mean, obviously, there's an error here in the posting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1947)|
| 0:32:31| It's up to you to decide whether it's an error that makes a significant difference or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1951)|
| 0:32:36| If you believe that the error that was committed in some way could make a significant difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1956)|
| 0:32:43| in whether or not a beer permit would issue here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1963)|
| 0:32:46| then you certainly have the authority to postpone this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1966)|
| 0:32:50| and ask for it to be advertised as you believe to be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1970)|
| 0:32:54| However, if you just believe that this is mostly a typographical error that was carried on over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1974)|
| 0:33:02| and that it really doesn't make any significant difference to the outcome of all of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1982)|
| 0:33:07| then you may conclude that you will just accept that as one of those errors that happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1987)|
| 0:33:12| and you may go ahead and do whatever it is you're going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1992)|
| 0:33:15| whether you grant a permit or whether you deny a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1995)|
| 0:33:19| I'd say it's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=1999)|
| 0:33:21| As a second district councilman who represents this area and is very familiar with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2001)|
| 0:33:27| I cannot see that it will make any difference based on the location of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2007)|
| 0:33:33| which is nearing completion, and the adjacency to a building which is also owned by the same partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2013)|
| 0:33:41| So I'm just going to – I know you all have something you'd like to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2021)|
| 0:33:45| but I'm going to go ahead and make a motion, and then we can discuss it further if you like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2025)|
| 0:33:50| and let this be approved pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2030)|
| 0:33:53| With the corrected address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2033)|
| 0:33:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2034)|
| 0:33:55| Well, absolutely, but I believe that he has taken care of that today already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2035)|
| 0:33:59| so I believe that the corrected address – am I right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2039)|
| 0:34:03| It's already in your possession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2043)|
| 0:34:09| We know it now from MPC, and we've had a brief conversation with this gentleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2049)|
| 0:34:13| Someone just needs to change that notation on the application and initial it for us, and the deed is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2053)|
| 0:34:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2059)|
| 0:34:20| Can you help us with who that individual needs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2060)|
| 0:34:22| The applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2062)|
| 0:34:23| And Mr. Newell needs to take care of that, and that would be the pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2063)|
| 0:34:29| Would that be a portion of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2069)|
| 0:34:32| If you say so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2072)|
| 0:34:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2073)|
| 0:34:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2074)|
| 0:34:35| And my motion is moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2075)|
| 0:34:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2076)|
| 0:34:37| Councilman Hopeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2077)|
| 0:34:39| I'm done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2079)|
| 0:34:40| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2080)|
| 0:34:41| I guess the other issue to make a difference on is the distance thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2081)|
| 0:34:48| From what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2088)|
| 0:34:49| Well, I guess not knowing that area, you're certain that we don't have any 50 – it would be 50 foot, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2089)|
| 0:34:57| Or 300 foot, because this is a 300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2097)|
| 0:35:01| This is our commercial area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| It's our retail and –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2103)|
| 0:35:04| The hospital is the only thing, I think, and it's too far away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| The hospital is all the way on the east end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2107)|
| 0:35:09| And there's beer permits on both sides of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2109)|
| 0:35:11| All three sides, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2111)|
| 0:35:12| There are no child care facilities and no churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2112)|
| 0:35:16| So, maybe we could use a church in Turkey Creek, but we don't have one yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2116)|
| 0:35:20| Couldn't find a place to park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2120)|
| 0:35:21| There's your business opportunity, Ms. Pelos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2121)|
| 0:35:24| It would be a good business opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| Yes, it would, a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| I've been reading lately that it can be a lucrative consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2128)|
| 0:35:31| What they say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2131)|
| 0:35:34| That's a good thought for you, Councilman Holmes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2134)|
| 0:35:37| Possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2137)|
| 0:35:39| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2139)|
| 0:35:42| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2144)|
| 0:35:45| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2145)|
| 0:35:46| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2146)|
| 0:35:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2147)|
| 0:35:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2148)|
| 0:35:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2149)|
| 0:35:50| Is this the same one or another thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| We have the manufacturing license to do next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2153)|
| 0:35:56| Okie Mountain Brewery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2158)|
| 0:35:59| Could you give us your name and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2159)|

| 0:36:08| Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2168)|
| 0:36:09| I don't guess DITO would work, would it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2169)|
| 0:36:13| Building inspection and fire prevention approval, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2173)|
| 0:36:19| Councilman Pelos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2179)|
| 0:36:20| Councilman Hall, I would make the same motion that I made previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2180)|
| 0:36:26| and also just to refresh the applicant's memory that it is very important for you to make the proper notation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2186)|
| 0:36:35| and sign it indicating the correct address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2195)|
| 0:36:38| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2198)|
| 0:36:42| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2202)|
| 0:36:44| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2204)|
| 0:36:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2205)|
| 0:36:46| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2206)|
| 0:36:48| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2208)|

| 0:37:11| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2231)|
| 0:37:12| Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2232)|
| 0:37:13| Waiting on a certificate of zoning and approval from the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2233)|
| 0:37:23| Moved to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2243)|
| 0:37:24| Pending receipt of final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2244)|
| 0:37:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2246)|
| 0:37:27| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2250)|

| 0:37:41| Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| On the agenda tonight, for your attention, Southern Grace's Catering and Events was approved at the August 28th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2263)|
| 0:37:51| Their 90 days is expiring, and they need additional time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2271)|
| 0:38:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| Is someone here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| Chairman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2287)|
| 0:38:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2288)|
| 0:38:09| I spoke with Mr. Husky on the telephone, and he indicated he would not be able to come this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2289)|
| 0:38:15| However, he provided a letter with this request on his letterhead, which is at each council member's place this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2295)|
| 0:38:23| I believe he's also spoken with Ms. Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2303)|
| 0:38:26| They've had a few delays, but they feel like they're within days of having all this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2306)|
| 0:38:31| So I would like to move to extend their permit for another 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2311)|
| 0:38:36| Second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2318)|
| 0:38:41| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2321)|
| 0:38:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2322)|
| 0:38:43| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2323)|
| 0:38:44| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2324)|
| 0:38:46| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2326)|
| 0:38:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2327)|
| 0:38:48| I just noticed something tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2328)|
| 0:38:51| We addressed this prior to Officer Husky coming on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2331)|
| 0:38:56| I think in the future it would be beneficial and also, I think, respectful if when we refer to folk with regards to the background checks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2336)|
| 0:39:04| there's a difference between no applicable record and no record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2344)|
| 0:39:08| Those folk who have no record, you know, I remember before being called on folk from home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2348)|
| 0:39:13| and from people who have watched Spirit Board who talked about, you know, how they came forward and they had no record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2353)|
| 0:39:18| but we said no applicable record, and they were contacted by friends who said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2358)|
| 0:39:23| you know, maybe you have even though you must have some sort of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2363)|
| 0:39:26| So I think in the future it would behoove us to maybe if there's no record, say no record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2366)|
| 0:39:30| If there is a record but it's not applicable, say no applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| And we discussed that before you came on, Officer Husky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2373)|
| 0:39:36| So somebody obviously didn't pass that on to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2376)|
| 0:39:40| Is there any other business that needs to come before the Bear Board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2380)|
| 0:39:44| We stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd071120?start=2384)|
