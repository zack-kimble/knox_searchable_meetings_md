| 0:04:50| It's held out at Turkey Creek in the parking lot at the pinnacle of Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=290)|
| 0:04:54| We have 25 restaurants participating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=294)|

| 0:05:03| This year we hope to top that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=303)|
| 0:05:05| And the date of that again is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=305)|

| 0:05:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=308)|

| 0:05:16| What's the cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=316)|
| 0:05:22| We believe that the ticket cost is $20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=322)|
| 0:05:27| But you could pay more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=327)|
| 0:05:29| Those tickets will be available online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=329)|
| 0:05:32| And I'm embarrassed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=332)|
| 0:05:33| $30 for him but everyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=333)|
| 0:05:35| I'm embarrassed that I don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=335)|
| 0:05:37| Okay, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=337)|
| 0:05:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=338)|
| 0:05:40| Next is the East Town Vapor Lounge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=340)|
| 0:05:43| The East Town Vapor Lounge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=343)|
| 0:05:54| Brian Hogan, 3001 Knoxville Center Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37924.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=354)|
| 0:06:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=361)|
| 0:06:02| Sergeant Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=362)|
| 0:06:03| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=363)|
| 0:06:04| Ms. Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=364)|
| 0:06:05| We need the certificate of zoning from MPC, the fire inspection approval, and the health department approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=365)|
| 0:06:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=370)|
| 0:06:11| Did you get your other issues resolved about the distance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=371)|
| 0:06:16| As far as I know, I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=376)|
| 0:06:18| Yeah, I turned in all the information I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=378)|
| 0:06:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=380)|
| 0:06:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=381)|
| 0:06:22| Just for the beer board's information, that shopping center includes a school and a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=382)|
| 0:06:32| And so his question was, as the crow flew, was he 300 feet from either one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=392)|
| 0:06:37| And after many measurements and much discussion, we believe that he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=397)|
| 0:06:42| So it will not be next to the school and next to a church for the Vapor Lounge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=402)|
| 0:06:47| And can't they come in from the outside?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=407)|
| 0:06:49| They don't have to come in through the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=409)|
| 0:06:51| Well, what it is is at the movie theater entrance, they can come in and we're right there on the right-hand side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=411)|
| 0:06:57| Actually, with our location, we're able to be open until midnight with the movie theater, with the rest of the mall blocked off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=417)|
| 0:07:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=424)|
| 0:07:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=425)|

| 0:07:18| Where the food court is, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=438)|
| 0:07:20| And I already got permission from, like, the leasing people from the mall, and they said that they would approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=440)|
| 0:07:27| I'm only going to be serving beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=447)|
| 0:07:29| I'm not doing any liquor, any wine, or any of the, like, high-grade stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=449)|

| 0:07:41| Do you have another question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=461)|
| 0:07:42| Yeah, I think I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=462)|
| 0:07:43| And that is, I hope you will take measures to be sure about the age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=463)|
| 0:07:47| That's an area where a lot of kids used to hang out in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=467)|
| 0:07:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=470)|
| 0:07:51| I don't know if they're still doing it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=471)|
| 0:07:52| So I think you need to be extra vigilant because they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=472)|
| 0:07:55| Yeah, definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=475)|
| 0:07:56| I'm putting a lot of consideration into it, especially if I get approved today pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=476)|
| 0:08:02| I want to make sure everything's in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=482)|
| 0:08:04| I know we have security there, which I'm going to be working hand-in-hand with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=484)|
| 0:08:08| I've thought of different things, like only serving beer after the mall is closed and only 21 up can get in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=488)|
| 0:08:14| So I'm tossing around a lot of ideas, but that's my number-one priority, to make sure it won't be in the hands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=494)|
| 0:08:21| and it won't be leaving the premises or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=501)|
| 0:08:24| That's my number-one concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=504)|
| 0:08:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=506)|

| 0:08:43| So we'd not like to see you again for underage issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=523)|
| 0:08:46| Definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=526)|
| 0:08:47| And I think it ties in with the electronic cigarettes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=527)|
| 0:08:50| We don't allow anyone under 18 to begin with in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=530)|
| 0:08:53| So definitely, like I said, that is my number-one priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=533)|
| 0:08:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=538)|

| 0:15:18| I move to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=918)|
| 0:15:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=920)|
| 0:15:21| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=921)|
| 0:15:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=922)|
| 0:15:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=923)|
| 0:15:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=924)|
| 0:15:25| Now, we have a couple of addendums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=925)|
| 0:15:30| The Crafty Bastard is not through with the final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=930)|
| 0:15:34| Is Aaron here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=934)|
| 0:15:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=935)|
| 0:15:36| Do you want to come up and talk to us about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=936)|
| 0:15:47| Are you close?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=947)|
| 0:15:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=948)|
| 0:15:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=949)|
| 0:15:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=950)|
| 0:15:51| Very much so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=951)|
| 0:15:52| Name and address and then tell us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=952)|
| 0:15:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=953)|
| 0:15:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=954)|
| 0:15:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=955)|
| 0:15:56| We're close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=956)|
| 0:15:57| As Councilman Grief can attest, he's seen us there nearly every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=957)|
| 0:16:02| We're getting very close to final inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=962)|
| 0:16:05| We hope to have health department, fire and CO next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=965)|
| 0:16:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=971)|
| 0:16:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=972)|
| 0:16:13| Do I need a motion to extend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=973)|
| 0:16:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=975)|
| 0:16:16| We need a motion to extend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=976)|
| 0:16:17| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=977)|
| 0:16:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=978)|
| 0:16:19| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=979)|
| 0:16:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=980)|
| 0:16:21| For 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=981)|
| 0:16:22| For 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=982)|
| 0:16:23| 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=983)|
| 0:16:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=984)|
| 0:16:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=985)|
| 0:16:26| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=986)|
| 0:16:27| Is that long enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=987)|
| 0:16:28| We hope so, don't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=988)|
| 0:16:29| We hope so, don't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=989)|
| 0:16:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=990)|
| 0:16:31| They need to have some inflow of cash, I would guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=991)|
| 0:16:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=994)|
| 0:16:35| So, I mean, we have every intention to be open by May and August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=995)|
| 0:16:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=999)|
| 0:16:40| Let me ask you another question while you're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1000)|
| 0:16:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1002)|
| 0:16:43| Are you involved in this Emory Place event that's coming up in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1003)|
| 0:16:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1006)|
| 0:16:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1007)|
| 0:16:48| We've been involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1008)|
| 0:16:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1009)|
| 0:16:50| The Emory Place Block Party, August 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1010)|
| 0:16:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1011)|
| 0:16:52| We've been involved in planning for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1012)|
| 0:16:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1013)|
| 0:16:54| And we're going to be a key component if we're open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1014)|
| 0:16:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1016)|
| 0:16:57| If you have your license by then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1018)|
| 0:16:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1019)|
| 0:17:00| Would you like to remain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| We need to vote on, I'm sorry, Mr. Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| Would you like 60 days just to be safe or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1024)|
| 0:17:07| I guess, I mean, so the only difference is if we do 30 and we're not open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1027)|
| 0:17:15| then I need to come back August 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1035)|
| 0:17:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1037)|
| 0:17:19| I mean, I guess it might as well be 60 because I, I mean, let me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1039)|
| 0:17:25| correct me if I'm wrong, so I've already been approved pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1045)|
| 0:17:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1048)|
| 0:17:29| So once next week when we get CO, fire, and health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1049)|
| 0:17:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1055)|
| 0:17:36| I can take those to WANDA and then it becomes pending to real beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1056)|
| 0:17:41| No, but you will get the real beer permit when you leave WANDA's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1061)|
| 0:17:45| That's what I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1065)|
| 0:17:46| It will be in your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1066)|
| 0:17:47| And then you won't have to come back and see us again because I know you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1067)|
| 0:17:50| never going to serve to underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1070)|
| 0:17:52| You've been here so many times that we'll soon give you a seat at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1072)|
| 0:17:55| But anyway, we need to vote on this 60-day extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1075)|
| 0:18:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1082)|
| 0:18:04| So we already have one motion, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1084)|
| 0:18:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1086)|
| 0:18:07| Are you amending or substituting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1087)|
| 0:18:08| We're amending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1088)|
| 0:18:09| Is that a friendly amendment to the 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1089)|
| 0:18:11| Oh, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1091)|
| 0:18:12| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1092)|
| 0:18:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1093)|
| 0:18:14| So we need to vote on the amendment first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1094)|
| 0:18:15| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1095)|
| 0:18:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1096)|
| 0:18:17| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1097)|
| 0:18:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1098)|
| 0:18:19| Now let's vote to do the 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1099)|
| 0:18:25| So we will expect that you'll be pouring by the time of this party| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1105)|
| 0:18:29| that's in front of Councilman Greaves' office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1109)|
| 0:18:32| Yes, I certainly hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1112)|
| 0:18:34| If anybody could put in a good word with the plans review office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1114)|
| 0:18:37| that would be fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1117)|
| 0:18:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1119)|
| 0:18:40| That would be Mr. Greaves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1120)|
| 0:18:41| He'll be at the next meeting this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| Next is the Whiskey Bend Bar and Dance Club on North Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1124)|
| 0:18:50| Josh Weyers, 4328 North Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1130)|
| 0:18:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1133)|
| 0:18:54| And you were first approved subject to some documentation in February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1134)|
| 0:18:59| and then you got a 60-day extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1139)|
| 0:19:02| So this has dragged out a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1142)|
| 0:19:05| When are you going to be able to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1145)|
| 0:19:07| We're shooting for September 1st opening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1147)|
| 0:19:09| When we rented the building, it wasn't in the shape to be rented at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1149)|
| 0:19:12| It was a food city, and they put up a wall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1152)|
| 0:19:15| and they claimed they had two spots to rent, but that doesn't work that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1155)|
| 0:19:18| They needed power, sewer, and water on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1158)|
| 0:19:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1160)|
| 0:19:21| And we were the lucky ones that didn't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1161)|
| 0:19:22| So we had to get all that going, and it's just taking a little bit more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1162)|
| 0:19:25| So September 1st is what we're shooting for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1165)|
| 0:19:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1167)|
| 0:19:28| 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1168)|
| 0:19:29| I'll move that we extend for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1169)|
| 0:19:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1171)|
| 0:19:32| You want a 60-day extension, and that way if it's done sooner than that, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1172)|
| 0:19:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1175)|
| 0:19:37| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1177)|
| 0:19:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1178)|
| 0:19:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1179)|
| 0:19:40| Can you tell us about your adventure once you get it open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1180)|
| 0:19:43| It's a country dance club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1183)|
| 0:19:44| We have WIVK with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1184)|
| 0:19:46| There will be an in-house studio, Stages West, selling their apparel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1186)|
| 0:19:50| It's a pretty good-sized event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| It's a country western bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1192)|
| 0:19:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1194)|
| 0:19:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1195)|
| 0:19:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1196)|
| 0:19:57| Before we adjourn, we do have one other order of business tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1197)|
| 0:20:01| and that order is that there is a state law that requires applicants for a beer permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1201)|
| 0:20:09| to either have a year of residency or be natural-born citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1209)|
| 0:20:16| We are working on getting the documentation together so that Wanda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1216)|
| 0:20:21| and Ms. Dyer are very familiar with what they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1221)|
| 0:20:24| TABC already has this requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1224)|
| 0:20:27| They have a form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1227)|
| 0:20:28| It's not exactly tailored to our needs, but it's a work in progress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1228)|
| 0:20:33| and we would expect that beginning August 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1233)|
| 0:20:38| people would be subject to providing the evidence that they are either citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1238)|
| 0:20:44| or have the year of residency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1244)|
| 0:20:47| And will there be a checkbox on the first page that shows that they've complied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1247)|
| 0:20:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1250)|
| 0:20:51| And we won't get the documentation because they're going to keep that in the file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1251)|
| 0:20:55| Right, but they will check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1255)|
| 0:20:57| We'll just have a check that we've done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1257)|
| 0:20:59| And we are also seeking an opinion from the Attorney General| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1259)|
| 0:21:03| because there is some question about whether this is constitutional or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1263)|
| 0:21:07| So that opinion could be next week, six years from now, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1267)|
| 0:21:14| So we don't have an opinion right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1274)|
| 0:21:17| but we do need to start doing these checks that are required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1277)|
| 0:21:22| Any other business before the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1282)|
| 0:21:25| Move to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1285)|
| 0:21:26| So adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd150721?start=1286)|
