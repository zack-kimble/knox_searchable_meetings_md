| 0:02:18| Moving on for our devotional, the floor is Commissioner Daley's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=138)|
| 0:02:26| Thank you, Madam Chair. It's my honor to introduce my pastor from Central Church of God, Pastor Garrett Reese.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=146)|
| 0:02:33| Well, I want to say thank you, obviously, to Carson Daley. He's a great member of the Central Church of God, so thankful for this opportunity. I want to say thank you to all of you commissioners that serve this great and fine county, and I believe that our best days are ahead of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=153)|
| 0:02:56| Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we bless you, and we come before you in the one and only name that is to be praised, the name of Jesus Christ. Lord, your word says and instructs us to pray for those in leadership and in government above us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=176)|
| 0:03:12| So today, Lord, we lift up these leaders. Today we ask, Lord, that you would give them godly wisdom, great decorum, and favor that comes only from you. Today we bless you, we praise you, we give you all the glory, honor, and thanks. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=192)|
| 0:03:32| Amen. Thank you, sir. And now we'll move on to the Pledge of Allegiance. Commissioner Oster, please offer the proper salute and pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=212)|
| 0:03:47| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=227)|
| 0:04:01| Thank you. Before we get down to agenda business, I'd like to give the floor to Chris Davis. He's our Executive Director of Knox County Elections, who's asked to say a few words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=241)|
| 0:04:19| Chair Hill, members of the County Commission, members of the Junior Commission, good to see you again, as well as members of the public here this evening. Thank you for your time. I will be brief. But obviously, unless you literally are living under a rock somewhere, you are probably familiar with the fact that there is currently an election going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=259)|
| 0:04:36| We are in the midst of early voting, and election day will be one week from tomorrow, March the 5th. I know obviously everybody in front of me is well aware of that. I'm sure most people behind me are aware of that. I just want to mention a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=276)|
| 0:04:49| For those that are currently in attendance today, if you have not voted, early voting is literally in the next room until 7 o'clock tonight. It will be until 10 to 7 tomorrow night, along with 10 other locations throughout Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=289)|
| 0:05:04| I want to thank the commissioners for their support of both early voting and election day. And I'm also here to ask you to tell your constituents that with regard to election day, if voters choose not to early vote, that is their right. On election day, there are five new polling places across Knox County. I believe there's one in your District Commissioner Lundy, and I believe there are two in your District Commissioner Schoonmaker, and there are two in your District Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=304)|
| 0:05:29| I would encourage you, if you are an election day voter, and you are dead set that you're going to vote on election day, do your homework beforehand. Particularly if you, and I am not editorializing, but if you choose to select a Republican ballot, that Republican ballot is quite long, and it is very onerous, and it takes a lot of time to finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=329)|
| 0:05:50| I have to my right, over here, former state legislator and current early voting worker at New Harvest, Harry Brooks, will attest to that, I am sure. But I just want to say, if you wait until election day, understand, and please share this with your constituents, we had the 12 days of early voting, so lines are going to be long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=350)|
| 0:06:07| I do not, we will be respectful as we can on election day, but these voters don't need to be giving my workers grief because they stand in line. They chose to wait until election day, and that's great, that is awesome. We're going to do everything we can. We sat in here this morning, and we will for the next six days, do instructions with our workers, telling them specifically, do not get in a hurry, because every voter deserves the same amount of time, and the same amount of attention as every other voter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=367)|
| 0:06:35| And I think that would be really, the only other thing I would share is if you're going to the polls, we have 10 contested races across Knox County, whether that not counting president or any of those congressional delegates, that's just county commission, school board, property assessor, law director, we have 10 contested races.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=395)|
| 0:06:52| I need voters desperately. I don't like close margins. I like blowouts. So please, if you have not voted, if you have not voted, tell your family, tell your friends to come out and early vote. And once again, I want to thank commission for its time and allowing me to speak, and if you haven't voted, early voting is right next door, 8 to 8 on election day. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=412)|
| 0:07:14| Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Davis. Good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=434)|
| 0:07:17| All right, commissioners, moving on to the agenda. These are some changes. Please note the additions of items 13, 22, 38, 41, and 42.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=437)|
| 0:07:36| We are deferring 36, 39, and 43. Withdrawals are none. And on none consent, we have items 31, 33, 34, and 35, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, and 42.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=456)|
| 0:08:05| Do I see any questions about that? Thank you. I also am requesting another change to the agenda. I would like to move item 37 of public forum to coincide with item 37.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=485)|
| 0:08:32| And I would also like to move 37 to the end of the agenda after we complete other business. Motion to approve as appended. Thank you. We have a motion for the agenda by Jay, second by Beeler. Any discussion? All those in favor? Aye. Opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=512)|
| 0:08:58| May I have a motion to approve ed and government consent? So moved. Second. Thank you. Motion by Daly, second by Durrett. Any discussion? All those in favor? Aye. Opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=538)|
| 0:09:20| Madam Clerk? We are on page 6, honorary resolution R-24-2-101. It is honoring Dr. Hank and Debbie Peck, their family, and the team at Long's Drug Store for over 60 years of service to the community. Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=560)|
| 0:09:46| Second. Motion to approve by Jay, second by Frazier. Any discussion? All those in favor? Aye. Opposed? Motion carries. Commissioner Jay, the floor is yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=586)|
| 0:09:58| Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you, Commission. I appreciate the support for this honorary resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=598)|
| 0:10:13| When you think of Long's Drug Store, you think of a gathering place like no other. When you think of Long's Drug Store, you think of a friendly face. You think of family. You think of quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=613)|
| 0:10:30| More importantly, as I asked around this week, to many of my constituents, what they remember about Long's Drug Store and the team that has always taken care of them, something came up time and again, and they said, man, those are good people. Good people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=630)|
| 0:10:50| And I don't know a higher compliment in Knox County to be called good people, and this is more than fitting. We do honorary resolutions for significant milestones. We also do them for significant achievements, and sometimes we look back and sometimes we look ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=650)|
| 0:11:08| Sometimes we encourage others to continue the good work they're doing, and sometimes we say thank you. And today we're going to say thank you with an opportunity to honor the Long's Drug Store family, the Peck family, and all they've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=668)|
| 0:11:23| Before I read our resolution and welcome our guests to the podium, I begrudgingly, given the amount of jokes that will come out of him, do want to welcome our former colleague and our good friend, which has served the 4th District for many, many years and is good family friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=683)|
| 0:11:41| I want to welcome former Commissioner Hugh Nystrom to join us at the podium for just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=701)|
| 0:11:46| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=706)|
| 0:11:49| Thank you very much, Commissioner Jay, and thank you to all of my past and present colleagues for your hard work on behalf of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=709)|
| 0:11:58| When I think of Long's Drug Store, my earliest memory as a child, I remember Maybel breaking me a hot fudge sundae. It was the very first time I'd ever had ice cream with chocolate there back in the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=718)|
| 0:12:11| My mother said, well, that Maybel woman, she looks old now, but she used to be a car hop back in the day when I was in college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=731)|
| 0:12:16| So many folks are talking about the relationships and the friendships that have been nourished over the years at Long's Drug Store, but I also want to say something that I haven't heard as much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=736)|
| 0:12:29| There are so many seniors out there. There are so many folks in our community, and I have seen it firsthand, that maybe they couldn't read the prescription on their medication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=749)|
| 0:12:40| Maybe they could have accidentally taken something wrong or incorrectly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=760)|
| 0:12:46| I know because I saw it firsthand, the care that Hank, his family, his father, his uncle, and that whole team always went out of their way just to take care of some of our seniors and the folks that needed extra help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=766)|
| 0:13:00| They could have been home alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=780)|
| 0:13:02| I know that you loved them, and I know that you all went out of your way to take care of so many people that weren't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=782)|
| 0:13:08| They were delivering medication to homes and checking on people in the 70s, and it's just something to be commended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=788)|
| 0:13:15| All that said, there have been countless numbers of friendships that have been made, nourished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=795)|
| 0:13:20| How many first dates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=800)|
| 0:13:21| How many older folks in our community have maintained their friendships by having coffee and breakfast at Long's over the years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=801)|
| 0:13:29| All that said, on behalf of so many people in the 4th District and all of Knoxville and Knox County, I just want to say thank you and let you know that you're loved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=809)|
| 0:13:38| I also want to say it's a great opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=818)|
| 0:13:41| Let's not let this just be a morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=821)|
| 0:13:43| Hank has busted – this Peck family has busted their tail, and now they've got an opportunity to reconnect and love one another as a family and lots of great opportunities in the future for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=823)|
| 0:13:56| I'm excited about all that extra family time, and who knows what is going to be next for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=836)|
| 0:14:01| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=841)|
| 0:14:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=842)|
| 0:14:14| Please join me as I follow along as I read this resolution on our behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=854)|
| 0:14:19| Whereas Long's Drugstore was opened on Wednesday, March 21, 1956, by Dr. Clarence Long as the anchor tenant in the first shopping center in Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=859)|
| 0:14:31| and whereas Long's Drugstore quickly became a neighborhood institution providing friendly service, personal attention, and reliable health care support and advice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=871)|
| 0:14:41| and whereas Dr. James H. Peck, Dr. Edwin A. Peck, and Dr. Henry E. Peck joined the team at Long's in 1959, 1963, and 1994, respectively, and carried Dr. Long's vision forward after his passing in 1966,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=881)|
| 0:14:58| and whereas the dedication of the Peck family led Long's Drugstore through 67 years of successful service to the citizens of Knox County, and Long's has remained one of the community's only family-owned and operated pharmacies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=898)|
| 0:15:12| and whereas the Peck family often went above and beyond for their customers, providing personal care to seniors who needed help with their medications and even made home deliveries long before others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=912)|
| 0:15:23| and whereas the positive impact Long's Drugstore made on Knoxville went far beyond the pharmacy into the timeless lunch counter that served generations of neighbors from after-school milkshakes to political power lunches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=923)|
| 0:15:36| from grandparents and grandchildren enjoying a burger and tots to big orange game days and chatter of a new season full of optimism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=936)|
| 0:15:44| and whereas the core values on display at Long's Drugstore by the Peck family included friendliness, compassion, encouragement, hard work, and trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=944)|
| 0:15:54| Those were always paired with the sense that when you entered Long's Drugstore, time slowed down and you were family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=954)|
| 0:16:02| Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Commission of Knox County as follows, the Commission of Knox County hereby honors Dr. Hank and Debbie Peck, their family, and the team at Long's Drugstore for their decades of dedicated service to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=962)|
| 0:16:15| Be it further resolved that a copy of this resolution be presented to the Peck family, and be it further resolved that this resolution is to take effect from and after its passage as provided by the Charter of Knox County, Tennessee, the public welfare requiring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=975)|
| 0:16:29| Please join me in welcoming and honoring Dr. Hank Peck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=989)|
| 0:16:34| The Lord has really blessed me with a wonderful family and so many really good friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=994)|
| 0:16:57| A wonderful community to live in and the opportunity to serve a community that I love, but it's hard to find the words that you've expressed that help make us feel this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1017)|
| 0:17:14| You've honored us so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1034)|
| 0:17:16| We thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1036)|
| 0:17:36| We have some requests up here for a picture of the family with Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1056)|
| 0:17:43| Would you mind stepping forward onto the podium and allowing us to take a picture with everyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1063)|
| 0:17:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1070)|
| 0:18:19| Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1099)|

| 0:18:56| We don't have any presentations, so the next items are the public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1136)|
| 0:19:02| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1142)|
| 0:19:03| And we will be doing public forum for all items except item 37.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1143)|
| 0:19:10| So the first person that has signed up is John Quinlan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1150)|
| 0:19:29| You know, I have perhaps made a mistake here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1169)|
| 0:19:32| Mr. Quinlan, are you speaking to agenda items or just in general?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1172)|
| 0:19:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1178)|

| 0:27:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1671)|
| 0:27:53| Public forum, please, on open topics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1673)|
| 0:27:56| Mr. Quinlan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1678)|
| 0:27:59| If you would give us your name and county of residence and you will have three minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1679)|
| 0:28:02| to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| Oh, goodness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1684)|
| 0:28:08| Can someone help him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1688)|
| 0:28:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1691)|
| 0:28:12| John Quinlan, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1692)|
| 0:28:15| I am here because I want to read the text of a sign that I took this morning at Iams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1695)|
| 0:28:20| Nature Center and it says, failure to pay for parking may result in penalties, fines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1700)|
| 0:28:26| towing, and or booting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1706)|
| 0:28:29| Scan one of the QR codes posted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1709)|
| 0:28:32| So, I guess you could say I'm here to express my concerns about having to pay on Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1712)|
| 0:28:36| property to use Knox County parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1716)|
| 0:28:40| Iams Nature Center put this proposal out and two weeks later, taxpayers are paying to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1720)|
| 0:28:45| Knox County property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1725)|
| 0:28:47| I have a big issue with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1727)|
| 0:28:48| I also have an issue with having to pay to use boats in Meade's Quarry, which is also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1728)|
| 0:28:54| Knox County property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1734)|
| 0:28:56| But when one of my friends complained about it, I think she sent an email this morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1736)|
| 0:29:00| to the county commission and my county commissioner sent back an email saying that the payment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1740)|
| 0:29:05| is voluntary, that we don't have to pay this parking tax at Iams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1745)|
| 0:29:09| So, I guess I want to get some clarification on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1749)|
| 0:29:12| But I also just want to, and I'm glad the mayor's here and I hope he has some feelings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1752)|
| 0:29:16| on this, but having to pay to use Knox County land is like double taxation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1756)|
| 0:29:20| And I'm inherently opposed to that, especially when unelected bureaucrats can impose these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1760)|
| 0:29:26| taxes without any oversight, with no public participation, and with no community involvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1766)|
| 0:29:32| whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1772)|
| 0:29:33| Now, Knox County owns the deeds to the land over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1773)|
| 0:29:37| And I'm asking you as a county commission to condemn these fees because this could start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1777)|
| 0:29:41| a process that cascades into fees for mountain biking all over town, for hiking on every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1781)|
| 0:29:47| trail, for swimming in every quarry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1787)|
| 0:29:50| I'm not an expert boater, but I don't need to rent a boat from River Sports to be safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1790)|
| 0:29:54| over there in that quarry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1794)|
| 0:29:56| So, I'm asking you all to kind of work with us outdoor enthusiasts to rein Iams in because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1796)|
| 0:30:03| if you don't, this is going to be out of control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| And I would appreciate any consideration you would give to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1806)|
| 0:30:09| And I would also like to add that I don't appreciate being threatened passively by my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1809)|
| 0:30:13| county commissioner telling people that if I come and complain about this, that I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1813)|
| 0:30:17| going to have any friends in the 9th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1817)|
| 0:30:19| I don't appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1819)|
| 0:30:21| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1821)|
| 0:30:23| So, I'm here with my friends, and you'll hear from them tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1823)|
| 0:30:27| And I would appreciate your support for taxpayers over a nature center that has closed board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1827)|
| 0:30:33| meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1833)|
| 0:30:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1834)|
| 0:30:35| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1835)|
| 0:30:42| Commissioner Daley, your light is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1842)|
| 0:30:45| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| First of all, it wasn't two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1847)|
| 0:30:49| And second of all, I did not say anything about citizens I talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1849)|
| 0:30:54| I don't think he would have a good reception at this county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1854)|
| 0:30:58| As you all read this email this morning, this has not been a two-week thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1858)|
| 0:31:02| This has been ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| Six years ago, they wanted to do a parking fee, and I fought it tooth and toenail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1864)|
| 0:31:09| But now Iams is over 600,000 visitors a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1869)|
| 0:31:14| It is being loved to death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1874)|
| 0:31:16| It's being trampled to death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1876)|
| 0:31:18| This is a voluntary parking fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| No matter what that sign says, we're Iams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1880)|
| 0:31:23| I'm on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1883)|
| 0:31:24| We are not calling a tow truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1884)|
| 0:31:26| We're not sending out a ticket writer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1886)|
| 0:31:27| We don't have that authority to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1887)|
| 0:31:30| So, this is not – this is a fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1890)|
| 0:31:34| We call it a fee, but it's really, I consider it to me, a donation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1894)|
| 0:31:37| Become a member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1897)|
| 0:31:38| A member is only $35 for a single membership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1898)|
| 0:31:42| $75 for a family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1902)|
| 0:31:44| And all this money will go to the maintenance of the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1904)|
| 0:31:49| Yes, Knox County owns the quarry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1909)|
| 0:31:52| We've made great improvements at the quarry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| We've got swimming areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1914)|
| 0:31:55| It was loved to death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1915)|
| 0:31:56| It was trampled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1916)|
| 0:31:58| It was trashed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1918)|
| 0:32:00| With Knox County's help, the Mayor Jacobs' help, with Parks and Rec's help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1920)|
| 0:32:04| and volunteers like the AEMBC, the Iams Quarry at Meads is clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1924)|
| 0:32:11| It's clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1931)|
| 0:32:12| There's a lot of docks we can go swimming on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1932)|
| 0:32:15| What's wrong with having a membership for $35 to support that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1935)|
| 0:32:20| Or for visitors to come in and pay $5, $5 only, not $25 or $35 like Dollywood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1940)|
| 0:32:29| and all these other parks are charging, a $5 donation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1949)|
| 0:32:33| There's nothing wrong with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1953)|
| 0:32:35| And I don't see it spreading to other parks either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1955)|
| 0:32:39| This process was started months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| I gave in because the park is being overlooked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1961)|
| 0:32:45| It needs maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1965)|
| 0:32:46| It needs help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1966)|
| 0:32:48| We went to Mayor Kincannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1968)|
| 0:32:51| We went to Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1971)|
| 0:32:52| We went to Parks and Rec.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| We all agreed that this actually the fee is probably too low for that park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1974)|
| 0:33:02| That park is not a Knox County park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1982)|
| 0:33:05| It is not a city of Knoxville park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1985)|
| 0:33:07| It is a nonprofit park that has to run on donations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1987)|
| 0:33:12| and anything that they get from concessions or the gift shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1992)|
| 0:33:18| So it's not a Knox County park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=1998)|
| 0:33:21| Yes, we own Meads Quarry as Knox County citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2001)|
| 0:33:25| but Meads Quarry needs to be taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2005)|
| 0:33:28| And the only way to take care of Meads Quarry and Iams Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| is to look for a structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2011)|
| 0:33:34| Instead of charging a 100% entrance fee with a toll gate out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2014)|
| 0:33:40| and you have to pay to come in, the Iams Board decided to try a parking fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2020)|
| 0:33:47| We know that if it's 100%, out of 100% of the people that go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2027)|
| 0:33:52| we may be lucky to get 30% donations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2032)|
| 0:33:56| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2036)|
| 0:33:57| If that's 30% that we can get there to improve the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2037)|
| 0:34:01| to keep the roads maintained and everything, that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| So I take exception that I said that he would have no friends in the 9th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2044)|
| 0:34:16| I did not say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2056)|
| 0:34:17| And the person I did say that to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2057)|
| 0:34:19| I will be talking to you come tomorrow morning because you misquoted me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2059)|
| 0:34:26| In my opinion, Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2066)|
| 0:34:27| there's nothing wrong with a $5 donation to keep Iams Nature Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2067)|
| 0:34:34| running beautiful and immaculate like it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2074)|
| 0:34:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2077)|
| 0:34:38| Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2078)|
| 0:34:39| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| I agree as long as it's considered a $5 donation and not a tax or a fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2082)|
| 0:34:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2090)|
| 0:34:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2093)|
| 0:34:54| Next speaker, Patricia Caveney, also on the parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2094)|
| 0:35:00| Do you still wish to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2100)|
| 0:35:05| Brett Huddleston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2105)|
| 0:35:13| Your name, please, and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2113)|
| 0:35:16| Patrick Cavaney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| Patrick, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2118)|
| 0:35:19| Yeah, I may have mistyped that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2119)|
| 0:35:22| Yes, I'd like to speak on the parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2124)|
| 0:35:25| You have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2125)|
| 0:35:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2126)|
| 0:35:27| Yeah, I'm an avid outdoorsman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2127)|
| 0:35:28| and I've used parks, national parks, state parks, Knox County parks for swimming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2128)|
| 0:35:33| climbing, and I've been in Knoxville for 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2133)|
| 0:35:38| It is a $50 annual fee, not $35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2138)|
| 0:35:43| And I guess my biggest concern is the fees are going to stay, clearly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2143)|
| 0:35:51| or donation, I guess we're going to call it that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2151)|
| 0:35:54| My biggest concern is just the insight that we have into how IMES is managing this public property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2154)|
| 0:36:01| in particular giving a monopoly to what I assume are friends over at River Sports to rent out boats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2161)|
| 0:36:11| I don't know why boat rentals are under this monopoly and bikes can ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2171)|
| 0:36:19| anyone can use their own bike, but you can't use your own boat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2179)|
| 0:36:22| And also because I'm primarily a climber at IMES,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2182)|
| 0:36:26| the main climbing entrance is also under this donation fee tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2186)|
| 0:36:33| And I've seen nothing in any of their glossy photos or renderings that they've put out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2193)|
| 0:36:38| that indicate that they're going to improve anything for climbers either at the climbing crag| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2198)|
| 0:36:42| or at the parking lot there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| So that's about all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2207)|
| 0:36:48| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2208)|
| 0:36:55| Commissioner Jay, did you have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2217)|
| 0:36:58| I might suggest that we take the comments to heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2218)|
| 0:37:04| City of Knoxville, Knox County, and IMES all own different pieces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2224)|
| 0:37:07| and perhaps invite Executive Director Amber Parker of IMES to come and give a presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2227)|
| 0:37:13| She will actually be giving a presentation to the Parks and Rec Advisory Board next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2233)|
| 0:37:17| Perhaps she could carry that on and bring it to the commission in full| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2237)|
| 0:37:21| and make sure we answer all questions and better understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2241)|
| 0:37:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2245)|
| 0:37:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2246)|
| 0:37:27| Excellent idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| Drew, if you would take note of that, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2249)|
| 0:37:35| Is Mr. Huddleston here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2258)|
| 0:37:39| Your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| My name is Brett Huddleston, and I am from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2261)|
| 0:37:46| I'm an avid rock climber at the IMES and a user of their crag there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2266)|
| 0:37:53| I don't believe it's very fair that they're going to start charging this fee to park there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2273)|
| 0:37:58| specifically at the Aberdeen Lane, mainly because the crag is not owned by IMES.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2278)|
| 0:38:05| Rather, it is the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| IMES does not have any dealings in the upkeep of that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2287)|
| 0:38:12| and it's done all by myself and other members of the community there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2292)|
| 0:38:18| And so I don't think that it's very fair that they are going to be making money off of that parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2298)|
| 0:38:25| when it's not going to go towards the upkeep and the maintenance of that crag,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2305)|
| 0:38:31| just in making it look nice and making sure all of the hardware is safe for people to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2311)|
| 0:38:42| And so I'm just confused as well as it now being said that it's a donation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2322)|
| 0:38:48| when there are signs up at the parking lot stating that there will be ticketing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2328)|
| 0:38:53| towing and booting cars if the fee is not paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2333)|
| 0:38:58| That is all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2338)|
| 0:38:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2339)|
| 0:39:00| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2340)|
| 0:39:06| Charles White?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2346)|
| 0:39:10| Ms. Mistral?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2350)|
| 0:39:12| Name and county of residence, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2352)|
| 0:39:16| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2356)|
| 0:39:17| My name is Charles White.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2357)|
| 0:39:18| I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2358)|
| 0:39:20| I'd like to thank the Commission for the chance to speak, and I have a few prepared comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2360)|
| 0:39:25| I want to state my concerns regarding the recently adopted parking fees in the IMES Nature Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2365)|
| 0:39:30| While we certainly want to ensure the Nature Center is adequately funded to continue its mission of being a public resource,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2370)|
| 0:39:38| there should have been greater involvement and consultation with the various stakeholders affected by this change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2378)|
| 0:39:43| Places like the City of Knoxville's Island Home Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2383)|
| 0:39:46| and the Forks of the River Wildlife Management Area sit contiguously to IMES| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2386)|
| 0:39:51| and offer access to the same greenway and trail systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2391)|
| 0:39:55| Because of the suddenness of this change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| it isn't hard to see that these city and state properties will bear an increased parking burden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2397)|
| 0:40:01| as users seek out more affordable parking options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2401)|
| 0:40:05| This will adversely affect several important naturalist and conservation-based communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2405)|
| 0:40:10| including trail runners, fishers, hunters, rock climbers, and mountain bikers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2410)|
| 0:40:15| who will face a significant increase in competition for limited space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2415)|
| 0:40:20| In the case of Island Home Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| taxpaying citizens will be inundated with more recreational parking demands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2422)|
| 0:40:26| that will contribute to traffic concerns in a residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2426)|
| 0:40:30| The haste with which this change in policy was reached reflects a lack of consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2430)|
| 0:40:34| for the way it will degrade these communities' participation in the local recreational economy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2434)|
| 0:40:39| and the quality of residential life for homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2439)|
| 0:40:43| IMES needs money earmarked for improvements, without a doubt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2443)|
| 0:40:47| However, any future changes with access to IMES must strive to include their neighbors' needs as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2447)|
| 0:40:53| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2455)|
| 0:40:59| Lucas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2459)|
| 0:41:04| Lucas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2464)|
| 0:41:09| Michaela Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2469)|
| 0:41:15| Caleb Kaiser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2475)|
| 0:41:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2480)|
| 0:41:28| Your name and county of residence, and you have three minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2488)|
| 0:41:33| My name is Caleb Kaiser, and I am a resident of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2493)|
| 0:41:37| I'm here on the topic of the IMES fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2497)|
| 0:41:42| I'm going to be perfectly honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| I really don't mind at all if people with the means to go and play with their very expensive toys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2504)|
| 0:41:49| have to pay a little bit of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| However, as a poor South Knoxville kid whose family of a schoolteacher, I'm a son of a schoolteacher, three kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2511)|
| 0:42:00| the only places we could afford to go were places like IMES.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2520)|
| 0:42:04| In the quarry, I played in that quarry when I was a little kid long before IMES came, and I love that place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2524)|
| 0:42:10| and it is dear to my heart, and it kept me out of a lot of trouble, to be perfectly honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2530)|
| 0:42:15| However, the separation between those who have and those who do not is unbearable to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2535)|
| 0:42:25| It shouldn't be a golden gate to the urban wilderness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2545)|
| 0:42:31| If it is an optional donation only, I am 100% in support of the plans going forward with IMES.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2551)|
| 0:42:43| I have nothing bad to say about IMES itself or the Commission or any of the ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2563)|
| 0:42:48| that have spurred on this pursuit of funds for further development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2568)|
| 0:42:54| What I do have a problem with is separating the citizens of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2574)|
| 0:42:58| who don't even know what they're missing for a legacy project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2578)|
| 0:43:06| I believe wholeheartedly that the citizens of Knoxville, if they want these developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2586)|
| 0:43:11| they will show up and they will pay for it, just like they did for the bike trails and many other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2591)|
| 0:43:18| Like the crag, that's all volunteer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| All the bike trails vastly volunteer, if not paid for by donations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2600)|
| 0:43:27| It can be done, and it doesn't have to saddle the residents who may not be able to afford it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2607)|
| 0:43:32| with a nether tax during what is already a very burdensome economic situation we're all already in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2612)|
| 0:43:39| Thank you for your time, Commission, and have a good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2619)|

| 0:45:55| Madam Chair, just a point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2755)|
| 0:45:58| Before we get into a motion and a vote and discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2758)|
| 0:46:02| do you want to hold the public forum portion of that before we entertain a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2762)|
| 0:46:07| Yes, we certainly will. And actually, before we do any of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2767)|

| 0:46:34| Knox County Mayor Glenn Jacobs, 400 Main Street right here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2794)|
| 0:46:39| I appreciate all of your support during this planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2799)|
| 0:46:42| As you are all aware, the growth policy process is complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2802)|
| 0:46:47| A reminder of how we got here after an attempt to amend the plan in 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2807)|
| 0:46:51| We listened to feedback and began the process of creating our first comprehensive land use and transportation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2811)|
| 0:46:57| This body approved a contract with Kimberly Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2817)|
| 0:47:00| We spent the last two years hearing feedback from over 4,000 residents and developing a draft plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2820)|
| 0:47:06| The plan has been posted on the website since October of 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2826)|
| 0:47:11| After this, we reconvened the growth policy committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2831)|
| 0:47:14| I propose an amendment based on the data gathered from the comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2834)|
| 0:47:17| The growth policy committee reconvened in October and held its final meeting in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2837)|
| 0:47:22| In all, there were four public meetings at which many of you were in attendance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2842)|
| 0:47:26| We heard from residents and members of this body requesting additional changes to the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2846)|
| 0:47:31| We carefully considered those requests, made some edits, and presented a final amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2851)|
| 0:47:36| which was approved at the growth policy committee's January 10th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2856)|
| 0:47:41| Based on the final amendment, I will not be reconvening the growth policy committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2861)|
| 0:47:46| I ask that you vote on the amendment that is presented before you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2866)|
| 0:47:49| There are members on the leadership team here to answer any questions you may have regarding the plan and the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2869)|
| 0:47:56| I ask for your support and help in moving this plan forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2876)|
| 0:47:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2881)|
| 0:48:05| As recommended, we are going to move forward with public forum on this item first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2885)|
| 0:48:10| and then we will get into the motion and commission discussion and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2890)|
| 0:48:15| First person on public forum is Brad Trueblood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2895)|
| 0:48:26| Mr. Trueblood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2906)|
| 0:48:31| Joyce Harrell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2911)|
| 0:48:38| Ms. Harrell, if you give your name and county of residence, you'll have three minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2918)|
| 0:48:43| And after Mr. Harrell will be Gerald Bryce and Kevin Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2923)|
| 0:48:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2929)|

| 0:48:58| and I would like to speak on behalf of the citizens of Corrington who are not here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2938)|
| 0:49:07| We are a rural area in northeast Knox County, and we have the beautiful House Mountain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2947)|
| 0:49:15| I've sat and listened to the discussion about IMES, how it's going to be overran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2955)|
| 0:49:21| The same thing is going to happen to House Mountain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2961)|
| 0:49:25| As more and more people come, I believe I heard a number of 70,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2965)|
| 0:49:31| that are expected to move into Knox County and Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2971)|
| 0:49:37| The roads will not hold them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2977)|
| 0:49:41| I do not know how they expect for the ambulances, the fire trucks to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2981)|
| 0:49:48| Yes, we have a helipad in Corrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2988)|
| 0:49:51| I hate to see it up and down, up and down the whole time if there is a major accident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2991)|
| 0:49:57| or a major, God forbid, a shooter at Corrington School for the police to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=2997)|
| 0:50:04| The traffic is unreal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| And I would like to challenge each and every commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3006)|
| 0:50:11| go to the far end of Washington Pike, 7 a.m., and drive all the way to the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3011)|
| 0:50:20| It is almost impossible to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| You will not get there before 8 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3022)|
| 0:50:25| And I would like to also say, read a thing that I found from Smithbilt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3025)|

| 0:50:37| But this is in regards to Belltown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3037)|
| 0:50:41| We are a part of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3041)|
| 0:50:43| We're on Ball Road, and we want to be a part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3043)|
| 0:50:47| We just don't want to come here and not listen to our neighbors about their concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3047)|
| 0:50:52| We are a part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3052)|
| 0:50:54| We don't want to go anywhere we're not wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3054)|
| 0:50:58| Mr. Sanderson, you're not wanted in Corrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3058)|
| 0:51:02| And please take that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3062)|
| 0:51:04| We want growth, but we don't want that kind of growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3064)|
| 0:51:10| Belltown is projected to have 1,103 homes in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3070)|
| 0:51:16| That is just unthinkable for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3076)|
| 0:51:20| And thank you for your time and consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3080)|
| 0:51:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3084)|

| 0:51:36| Is Mr. Bryce here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3096)|
| 0:51:39| Followed by Kevin Murphy and Broadus Hubs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3099)|
| 0:51:43| Mr. Bryce, your name and county of residence, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3103)|
| 0:51:47| My name is Gerald Bryce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3107)|
| 0:51:49| I live in District 7 in Halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3109)|
| 0:51:51| I was born and raised in Bearden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3111)|
| 0:51:53| My father's family lived in the Mascot area, and I spent a lot of time there growing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3113)|
| 0:52:00| After high school, I spent 22 years in the Navy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3120)|
| 0:52:04| My wife and I decided after retirement that we would come back to Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3124)|
| 0:52:09| because we hadn't found any place we liked any better than this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3129)|
| 0:52:13| We lived from coast to coast, to Florida, up to New Jersey, California,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3133)|
| 0:52:19| and we couldn't find any place better than this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3139)|
| 0:52:23| Between 2010 and 2022, the average growth rate in Knox County was 1.1% per year average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3143)|
| 0:52:31| However, including this was the 2019-20 and 2021 growth rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3151)|
| 0:52:42| From 2019 to 2020, it was 2.2%, and 2021, the growth rate was 1.95%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3162)|
| 0:52:51| significantly increased than it was earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3171)|
| 0:52:55| The post-pandemic growth is what I gather is going to be high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3175)|
| 0:53:01| I understand the need for a growth plan, and this plan should be fair and balanced for all residents of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3181)|
| 0:53:08| which, in my opinion, this plan is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3188)|
| 0:53:11| My comments are mainly about northeast Knox County because this is the area I'm most familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3191)|
| 0:53:18| The growth plan indicates approximately 40,000 new residents in the northeast Knox area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3198)|
| 0:53:25| I don't believe there's an accurate way to determine how many new households this will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3205)|
| 0:53:32| However, in 2021, Knox County registered two vehicles per household in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3212)|
| 0:53:41| and this 40,000 is going to add a lot to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3221)|
| 0:53:48| The Federal Highway Administration has formulas to calculate maximum traffic density for rural two-lane roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3228)|
| 0:53:56| which Washington Pike, Tazewell Pike, and Emory Road is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3236)|
| 0:54:02| With information I could find, the three arteries meet or exceed these guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3242)|
| 0:54:11| My figures could be incorrect, but that's the best I could come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3251)|
| 0:54:16| The transportation infrastructure in northeast Knox is not adequate to support the growth indicated by this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3256)|
| 0:54:25| Other areas of infrastructure that are inadequate include, but are not limited to, the sheriff's office, fire protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3265)|
| 0:54:34| water and sewage, access to medical care, and a biggie, the increased loading on landfill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3274)|
| 0:54:45| In my opinion, all growth should be based on infrastructure that is in place, not what is proposed or planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3285)|
| 0:54:58| This proposed plan, while well-meaning, proposes to change the lifestyle and culture of this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3298)|
| 0:55:06| and these are the reasons that I returned to this area when I retired from the Navy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3306)|
| 0:55:11| and that's the reason that people want to move into this area, and this growth plan destroys that, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3311)|
| 0:55:20| Mr. Bryce, are you about finished, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| I thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3322)|
| 0:55:23| Thank you. Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3323)|
| 0:55:32| Kevin Murphy, Broadus Hobbs, and Harry Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3332)|
| 0:55:39| Kevin Murphy, your name, and you have three minutes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3339)|
| 0:55:44| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3344)|
| 0:55:45| Kevin Murphy, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3345)|
| 0:55:48| I represent Knox Community Planning Alliance and Advocates for Balanced Growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3348)|
| 0:55:53| We've been really engaged in the growth plan, general plan, and advanced Knox for the last several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3353)|
| 0:56:00| With you tonight, our request is that the growth plan and comprehensive plan, they're really tied together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3360)|
| 0:56:06| and we would request that you do something like tie the approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3366)|
| 0:56:11| or the effectiveness of the growth plan to the new comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3371)|
| 0:56:16| I've talked with a lot of you, and there's a bad outcome we're trying to avoid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3376)|
| 0:56:22| The growth plan amendment, it adds 9,000 acres of new planned growth area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3382)|
| 0:56:26| and that land is currently subject to development restrictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3386)|
| 0:56:29| which won't apply anymore once the new growth plan takes effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3389)|
| 0:56:34| Without a new comprehensive plan and a comprehensive plan with teeth, with some enforceable requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3394)|
| 0:56:40| we believe that the bad outcome that you get is a land rush, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3400)|
| 0:56:44| of new rezonings and development plans in this expanded growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3404)|
| 0:56:48| Open spaces, fields, and forests would develop in ways that aren't in character with the surrounding rural community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3408)|
| 0:56:54| And when you get a lot of subdivision development out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3414)|
| 0:56:58| there's a lot of good fiscal impact analysis done during the advanced Knox process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3418)|
| 0:57:03| and that's where we learned that that's the one that is a negative revenue in terms of taxes and cost for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3423)|
| 0:57:10| You're really looking to have that mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3430)|
| 0:57:13| That's the one that's a more positive revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3433)|
| 0:57:15| So our hope is that a new comprehensive plan will raise our development standards out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3435)|
| 0:57:22| All of you and Mayor Jacobs and the staff have been supportive of advanced Knox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3442)|
| 0:57:26| and I want to give a special thank you to the county and planning staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3446)|
| 0:57:29| for working through all the intricate details and interconnected layers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3449)|
| 0:57:34| We have plans today, a lot of plans and a lot of policies and actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3454)|
| 0:57:38| Our problem has been that they haven't been implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3458)|
| 0:57:41| There is a lot of good ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3461)|
| 0:57:42| So what you're charged with and what we are hoping and trusting you do is to is to implement those plans and implement those actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3462)|
| 0:57:54| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3474)|
| 0:57:57| And a group of us, including several former planning commissioners, we've been looking at our draft, the comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3477)|
| 0:58:03| We've looked at what other counties and states are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3483)|
| 0:58:06| We've submitted some a number of pages of comments and suggestions to the staff, and I know that they're diligently going through them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3486)|
| 0:58:13| So we trust the professional staff, planning commission and yourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3493)|
| 0:58:17| We'll make sure the comprehensive plan will have those enforceable requirements that will really change the decision making process for planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3497)|
| 0:58:26| and county commission and really let us begin changing our land use decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3506)|
| 0:58:31| So to close, our ask is simply to tie the growth plan effectiveness to a new company, to the adoption of the new comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3511)|
| 0:58:39| And we think that'll steer us away from some bad outcomes we're afraid of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3519)|
| 0:58:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3523)|
| 0:58:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3528)|
| 0:58:49| Broadus Hubs, followed by Harry Brooks and Julie Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3529)|
| 0:58:56| Is Mr. Hubs here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3536)|
| 0:59:00| Mr. Brooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3540)|
| 0:59:07| Madam Speaker, would it be possible to move me to the bottom of the list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3547)|
| 0:59:11| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3551)|
| 0:59:12| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3552)|
| 0:59:19| Is Julie Thompson here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3559)|
| 0:59:27| Ms. Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3567)|
| 0:59:30| Three minutes and your name and county address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3570)|
| 0:59:34| Julie Thompson, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3574)|
| 0:59:36| I'm a retired teacher, principal and executive director of elementary education for the Knox County school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3576)|
| 0:59:43| I have devoted my life's work as an educator to doing what's best for children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3583)|
| 0:59:48| As I have attended meetings and listened to everyone talk about the development of the 8th district and the need to allow more housing, such as subdivisions, condos and apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3588)|
| 0:59:59| I haven't heard anyone talk about the impact of that development will have on the children of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3599)|
| 1:00:05| As a farmer's wife, I've had the privilege to raise two children and now two grandchildren on our farm in Corryton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3605)|
| 1:00:13| There, my children were able to run and play, swing, ride their bikes, go fishing, climb fences and a whole host of other activities that happen outside of our house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3613)|
| 1:00:23| My grandchildren are experiencing those activities now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3623)|
| 1:00:27| Being able to play outside is critical to their healthy development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3627)|
| 1:00:32| I was surprised to learn that while you may be eager to allow development to flourish in the 8th district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3632)|
| 1:00:38| there are no development standards by which the developers must use to plan their communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3638)|
| 1:00:45| They're simply given the keys to the kingdom to remove trees and any unwanted soil, cover the roads with pavement and houses and move on to the next project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3645)|
| 1:00:55| There's no expectation that they will provide green space for children to run, playgrounds for them to get much-needed exercise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3655)|
| 1:01:03| bicycle trails, ponds for fishing or gardens for them to work alongside their parents or other adults in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3663)|
| 1:01:11| With childhood obesity rates at an all-time high and teenage mental health and depression at crisis levels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3671)|
| 1:01:18| there needs to be some attention paid to the families and the people who will be living in these housing developments long after the developers have left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3678)|
| 1:01:27| If there are 200 houses in a space, there's likely to be 200 children living there also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3687)|
| 1:01:33| Are they to play outside in their less than quarter acre yard or in the street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3693)|
| 1:01:38| None of those options sound safe or adequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3698)|
| 1:01:42| I accept that people have the right to sell and purchase their property as they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3702)|
| 1:01:47| However, as a commission, you have the responsibility to the people living in those neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3707)|
| 1:01:52| to ensure that they have the highest quality of life possible by simply requiring appropriate neighborhood design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3712)|
| 1:02:00| The school system has program standards that contractors are required to use when building new schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3720)|
| 1:02:07| that ensure that the facilities meet the needs of the children who will attend the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3727)|
| 1:02:12| A community of families with children deserve nothing less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3732)|
| 1:02:16| I urge you to have a vision for what life will be like for the children in those communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3736)|
| 1:02:21| and take time to develop program standards that developers must follow to ensure healthy children, healthy families, and healthy communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3741)|
| 1:02:32| You can require developers to create those spaces where children can get out of their houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3752)|
| 1:02:37| put down their devices, and enjoy the beautiful seasons that we're fortunate to have in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3757)|
| 1:02:43| It is done in other counties all across the nation, and it can be done in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3763)|
| 1:02:49| Please postpone your vote tonight to allow time for the development of program standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3769)|
| 1:02:53| that all developers must use when creating new neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3773)|
| 1:02:57| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3777)|
| 1:02:59| Next speaker is Charlie Martinez, followed by Sandra Korbelick and Adam Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3779)|
| 1:03:19| Name and county of residence, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3799)|
| 1:03:30| You have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3810)|
| 1:03:31| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3811)|
| 1:03:32| Charlie Martinez, Knox County, but I come to you all as Dr. Charlie Martinez,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3812)|
| 1:03:37| the state specialist for farm financial management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3817)|
| 1:03:41| I'm going to read off some bullet points, some of the research that we've done at UT and the Center of Farm Management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3821)|
| 1:03:47| I'm used to having slides and a clicker, so I'm going to try to read it as thoroughly as I can and as quickly as I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3827)|
| 1:03:54| In the fall of 2022, I was approached by Commissioner Jeff Aiken, Assistant Commissioner Jeff Aiken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3834)|
| 1:04:01| to understand the American Farmland Trust, sorry, American Farmland Trust analysis of farmland loss in Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3841)|
| 1:04:10| where they ranked Tennessee as the fourth most threatened state for farmland loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3850)|
| 1:04:14| Sorry. And then since then, in 2022, they ranked them number three behind Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3854)|
| 1:04:21| I mean, behind Texas and North Carolina. Since then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3861)|
| 1:04:26| the University of Tennessee Center for Management has analyzed the rate of loss in Tennessee in terms of farm and forestry acre loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3866)|
| 1:04:35| To put this in perspective, from 1997 to 2017, 1.1 million acres was lost, which is the equivalent of four counties in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3875)|
| 1:04:43| Furthermore, to put that in perspective, that's 55,601 acres per year or 6.3 acres per hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3883)|
| 1:04:53| Since 2017, we've actually increased the number of acres we've lost as a state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3893)|
| 1:05:01| We've actually lost since 2017, 432,941 acres or an acre or an average of 86,580 acres per year or equivalent to 9.8 acres per hour over that time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3901)|
| 1:05:19| The most prevalent area where farm and land conversion has been occurring is in Middle and East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3919)|
| 1:05:25| Middle Tennessee, Nashville, East Tennessee, Knoxville and Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3925)|
| 1:05:30| Going forward, industrial development in West Tennessee will lead to increased loss of Tennessee's most productive cropland and pasture land and forage land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3930)|
| 1:05:39| While we do know that people do have the ability to sell their land, we work with producers every day within our center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3939)|
| 1:05:47| Tennessee is in the inevitable position of having extensive farm and forest land resources and a robust economy with high rates of population growth and economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3947)|
| 1:05:57| While Tennessee's farm and forest land resources are extensive, they are not infinite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3957)|
| 1:06:02| Rapid conversion of farm and forest land threatens to reduce agriculture production, disrupt rural communities, destroy wildlife habitat and limit recreational opportunities while increasing soil and water pollution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3962)|
| 1:06:15| In the 2023 governor's report, the state ag forestry industrial complex was accounted for 11% of the economic activity in the state, which puts it at number one within the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3975)|
| 1:06:27| As individuals, we do not invest our retirement into a single stock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3987)|
| 1:06:31| Professionals advise individuals to diversify investments into multiple sectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3991)|
| 1:06:35| Similarly, a state's economy is likely more resilient if diversified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=3995)|
| 1:06:40| Having multiple sectors that move indirectly would be better to insulate the economy from economic downturns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4000)|
| 1:06:46| Agri-forestry is a sector of the Tennessee's economy that needs consideration for growth like manufacturing and or technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4006)|
| 1:06:53| This would help develop a resilient economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4013)|
| 1:06:55| Protecting the farmland for the ag forestry sector is like developing skilled employees for manufacturing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4015)|
| 1:07:00| Both are vital inputs into growing these sectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4020)|
| 1:07:04| One last thing, I know I'm out of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4024)|
| 1:07:06| We run reports with the crop productivity index from a national database that we actually can monitor by acreage count throughout the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4026)|
| 1:07:15| So in that research, we actually monitor by county in Tennessee the number of what we consider the most highly productive land by county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4035)|
| 1:07:23| In Tennessee, 3.1 of the available acres in Tennessee is the most valuable cropland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4043)|
| 1:07:29| Where it's at is actually in the northeast Tennessee quadrant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4049)|
| 1:07:32| So that's something to think about moving forward with the limited resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4052)|

| 1:08:42| It should not be overlooked by anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4122)|

| 1:08:50| As a sixth generation farmer and a board member of Knox Union Cattlemen's Association, that's certainly not lost on me either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4130)|
| 1:08:56| It's certainly not lost on anyone in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4136)|

| 1:09:33| When we're talking about prime farmland in this planned growth area, in the northeast Knox area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4173)|
| 1:09:41| it was said in committee that Knox County is just not an ag county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4181)|
| 1:09:46| It's not an ag county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4186)|
| 1:09:49| Prime farmland, okay, it sounds great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4189)|
| 1:09:52| The national average for corn production is about 168 bushels per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4192)|
| 1:09:57| I know for most of you all that doesn't really mean a whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4197)|
| 1:09:59| It's just a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4199)|
| 1:10:02| In this planned growth area, we have 2023 current production of 230 bushels per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4202)|
| 1:10:10| That's prime farmland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4210)|
| 1:10:12| When chopped for silage, it produces over 30 tons of silage per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4212)|
| 1:10:19| That's not a small number, especially when the national average is only 168 bushels per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4219)|
| 1:10:27| Would you all be surprised to know that that is also currently owned by a developer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4227)|
| 1:10:34| It just happens to be farmed because this plan is not in place yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4234)|
| 1:10:38| They currently don't have the quote unquote on paper permission to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4238)|
| 1:10:46| There are other acres just like this that are waiting for this growth plan to go into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4246)|
| 1:10:52| We cannot have this growth plan go into effect without the comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4252)|
| 1:10:57| Most of us go to church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4257)|
| 1:10:59| Anybody take communion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4259)|
| 1:11:00| What if you went to communion and you only had bread and you had no wine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4260)|
| 1:11:04| Did you really take communion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4264)|
| 1:11:06| We need both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4266)|
| 1:11:08| We can't do one without the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4268)|
| 1:11:11| So we're asking you please either postpone until we get the comprehensive plan together or tie them together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4271)|
| 1:11:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4277)|
| 1:11:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4278)|
| 1:11:27| Mr. Manal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4287)|
| 1:11:28| Thank you, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4288)|
| 1:11:29| Yeah, I'm Kent Manal, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4289)|
| 1:11:31| This comment is from the local Sierra Club group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4291)|
| 1:11:34| There's a more complete version that's been emailed to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4294)|
| 1:11:37| The advanced Knox process established several community priorities, which are clearly expressed in public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4297)|
| 1:11:44| People want conservation of farmland, open space, ridgetop protection, and affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4304)|
| 1:11:50| The current form of the comprehensive plan doesn't mention these things, nor does the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4310)|
| 1:11:56| The growth policy plan is supposed to be derived from the comprehensive land use and transportation plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4316)|
| 1:12:01| but if there's a flaw or omission in that comprehensive plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4321)|
| 1:12:05| then we must resolve it before we pass any amendments to the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4325)|
| 1:12:10| We've had no hearings or discussions on the draft comprehensive plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4330)|
| 1:12:14| so we're not ready to finalize the growth policy plan, amendments or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4334)|
| 1:12:19| Remember the old shell game where the huckster switches cymbals around and then dares the rube to guess where the P is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4339)|
| 1:12:25| Well, in this case, the disappearing P is the protections people established during advanced Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4345)|
| 1:12:32| Until you get them into the comprehensive plan with a genuine public process, they're not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4352)|
| 1:12:38| Vote for these amendments and you're confirming public suspicions that the fix is in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4358)|
| 1:12:43| Now, there's a clean, responsible way out of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4363)|
| 1:12:47| Postpone a decision on these amendments one to three months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4367)|
| 1:12:49| to give yourselves and the planning commission time to evaluate and amend the comprehensive plan with proper public participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4369)|
| 1:12:58| Or just vote the amendments down now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4378)|
| 1:13:01| This public is here to make sure you preserve the protections we clearly expressed at the growth policy committee meeting on January 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4381)|
| 1:13:09| With one exception, every voice pleaded urgently for the preservation of community character and environmental protections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4389)|
| 1:13:16| The exception was a real estate representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4396)|
| 1:13:20| So what's wrong with these amendments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4400)|
| 1:13:22| They punt all the tough decisions to a unified development ordinance that'll take at least two more years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4402)|
| 1:13:28| In that time, the GPP would open up over 10,000 acres of the county without any improved development standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4408)|
| 1:13:35| The amendments provide no protection for our rural character and nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4415)|
| 1:13:39| The map shows large swaths of farmland and open space in its planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4419)|
| 1:13:44| Total suburban sprawl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4424)|
| 1:13:46| The amendments only envision transportation by personal vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4426)|
| 1:13:50| More cars on county roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4430)|
| 1:13:52| Is anyone thinking about climate change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4432)|
| 1:13:54| There's no mention of public transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4434)|
| 1:13:56| With the growing congestion on county roads, why require everyone to have a car?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4436)|
| 1:14:01| The sector plans are gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4441)|
| 1:14:03| This denies property owners existing protections for properties and neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4443)|
| 1:14:07| No justification for their removal has been given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4447)|
| 1:14:09| The amendments eviscerate all protections for hillsides, slopes, and ridge stops, despite clear public support for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4449)|
| 1:14:17| Make them mandatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4457)|
| 1:14:19| What about energy efficiency standards for houses and businesses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4459)|
| 1:14:22| What about community solar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4462)|
| 1:14:24| Have you noticed we're electrifying our economy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4464)|
| 1:14:26| We need a comprehensive plan that reflects public intent and a growth policy plan and revised zoning ordinances that cannot deviate from that agreed upon plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4466)|
| 1:14:34| The comprehensive plan needs teeth, so they can't make a zoning change any time a developer wants one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4474)|
| 1:14:41| Thank you so much for your kind attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4481)|

| 1:15:08| I'm speaking on behalf of Community Forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4508)|
| 1:15:11| Community Forum's recent letter to commissioners spelled out many specific concerns about the growth policy plan, GPP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4511)|
| 1:15:19| I and other members made comments at four meetings of the coordinating committee and during the advance Knox process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4519)|
| 1:15:25| We urge you to vote no on the growth policy plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4525)|
| 1:15:28| The comprehensive land use and transportation plan, which has not been discussed by county commission nor recommended by planning commission, is intertwined with the GPP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4528)|
| 1:15:38| By state law, it and all other plans must be consistent with the GPP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4538)|
| 1:15:44| However, it is not on today's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4544)|

| 1:16:17| At Ideas Week, people were asked to note treasures defined as what do you love most about Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4577)|

| 1:16:32| Only 187 people attended those meetings at seven locations and 249 others commented online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4592)|
| 1:16:40| Sadly, these comments were ignored in the proposed plans, especially dealing with preserving slopes and farmland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4600)|

| 1:18:50| Hello, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4730)|
| 1:18:51| I recognize that as public servants, you often face problems that have no clear answers or solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4731)|
| 1:18:58| Thank you for allowing the public's input this evening on these challenging topics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4738)|
| 1:19:03| Tonight, I ask you to delay your vote on the 4,900 acres that will be added to Washington Pike, Rita, and Malonaville areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4743)|
| 1:19:12| Please delay the vote to take additional time to make amendments to the current plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4752)|
| 1:19:16| My family lives in the Clearbrook Estates subdivision off Tazewell Pike just outside the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4756)|
| 1:19:23| We recently moved here from New Mexico.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4763)|
| 1:19:26| We have absolutely fallen in love with our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4766)|
| 1:19:29| The rural charm, beauty, and local history is unique,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4769)|
| 1:19:33| but this uniqueness will be stripped away with the current plan of the proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4773)|
| 1:19:39| In spite of my love for this new area, the first year we were here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4779)|
| 1:19:43| I was horrified by the amount of time I sat in gridlocked traffic navigating to and from my home daily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4783)|
| 1:19:51| The amount of dwellings that the new planned growth area allows will increase traffic in our area exponentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4791)|
| 1:19:58| Getting to and from my home during rush hour is already a nightmare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4798)|
| 1:20:03| I understand that Washington Pike will be widened to alleviate some of these concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4803)|
| 1:20:08| but what about the other roads that feed our neighborhoods?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4808)|
| 1:20:10| If you add the amount currently proposed to development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4810)|
| 1:20:14| our part of the city will go from having main arterial roads that are very congested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4814)|
| 1:20:20| to having main arterial roads that are in cardiac arrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4820)|
| 1:20:24| If you do proceed with the plan as it is currently laid out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4824)|
| 1:20:28| what provisions are there not only for the increase in traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4828)|
| 1:20:31| but for the ability to keep our people safe on the roads?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4831)|
| 1:20:35| Has more law enforcement been budgeted when we have the inevitable increase in traffic accidents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4835)|
| 1:20:41| What about provisions for emergency services such as rural metro?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4841)|
| 1:20:45| What is the plan to minimize noise and light pollution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4845)|
| 1:20:49| The secret is out about how great East Tennessee is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4849)|
| 1:20:53| Tens of thousands of people like myself want to move here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4853)|
| 1:20:58| Please take the time to make sure your plan will allow for growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4858)|
| 1:21:01| that will benefit the newcomers as well as your current constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4861)|
| 1:21:06| Newcomers to East Tennessee are drawn to the amazing natural beauty here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4866)|
| 1:21:11| People moving expect to live in and around this alluring natural environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4871)|
| 1:21:16| They do not expect to sit in an hour of traffic for their daily commute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4876)|
| 1:21:21| Please delay your vote and consider amendments to decrease the dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4881)|
| 1:21:25| to something that better fits our rural character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4885)|
| 1:21:28| and something that our area can realistically accommodate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4888)|
| 1:21:32| Knoxville must plan for growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4892)|
| 1:21:35| but this growth plan does not contain enough provisions to grow responsibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4895)|
| 1:21:40| Where are the legal mandates for sidewalks, for greenways, for parks and bike paths?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4900)|
| 1:21:46| We have the chance tonight to cast aside the outdated idea of overdevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4906)|
| 1:21:51| Does Northeast Knox County really need to absorb 52% of the new planned growth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4911)|
| 1:21:57| The current plan for development does not offer enough protections for our natural environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4917)|
| 1:22:03| This is untenable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4923)|
| 1:22:05| Ms. Johnson, could you wrap it up, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4925)|
| 1:22:07| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4927)|
| 1:22:09| What kind of legacy will your legislation tonight bring?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4929)|
| 1:22:12| Please make the changes necessary to help us leave a creative legacy of growth we all can be proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4932)|
| 1:22:17| Thank you. Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4937)|
| 1:22:18| Mr. Steltenkamp, Mary Long, Mr. Sale, and Ms. Nolan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4938)|
| 1:22:31| I am Benjamin Steltenkamp. Thank you for pronouncing it correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4951)|
| 1:22:36| It's been a bane to my entire existence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4956)|
| 1:22:38| I am a member of Knox County. I live in Knox County. I'm a resident of Ridda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4958)|
| 1:22:43| My wife and I chose this area because of its rural setting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4963)|
| 1:22:46| and the changes that are being proposed will forever change it for the worst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4966)|
| 1:22:50| Now, I totally understand the need for affordable housing, as well as the increase in housing density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4970)|
| 1:22:55| but this area is not currently compatible with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4975)|
| 1:22:58| Knox County needs all the agricultural zoning it has, and we should be adding acres of land, not taking them away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4978)|
| 1:23:04| I find it ironic on our seal, it says agriculture, and I'm just hearing we're losing it constantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4984)|
| 1:23:10| Northeast Knox County is the last area in Knox that still has large open spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4990)|
| 1:23:16| and who is to blame for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4996)|
| 1:23:18| Certainly not the residents that have been great stewards of their land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=4998)|
| 1:23:21| We have many neighbors who have been farming and ranching their land for multiple generations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5001)|
| 1:23:26| You, the representatives of Knox County, should be bending over backwards to help them keep farming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5006)|
| 1:23:31| and not making way for traditional neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5011)|
| 1:23:34| So, it seems now the plan is we turn over this land to a bunch of developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5014)|
| 1:23:39| Before my family moved here, we lived in the state of Florida,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5019)|
| 1:23:43| the state that never met a developer it didn't like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5023)|
| 1:23:46| Gridditt and Gibbs do not want to become another Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5026)|
| 1:23:50| Our area does not have the roads, nor the ability to handle thousands more households worth of sewage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5030)|
| 1:23:56| Have you driven down Washington Pike during rush hour?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5036)|
| 1:24:00| We are hearing the county has no plans to add more schools, just add to the capacity of our current schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5040)|
| 1:24:06| How will this work when our local schools can't even hire enough teachers and staff at our current enrollment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5046)|
| 1:24:11| So, what a lot of us want to know is, are the developers going to pay for all the infrastructure costs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5051)|
| 1:24:18| No, most likely they will not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5058)|
| 1:24:21| It will be us, the taxpayers, that will have to pay for it when we are asking for none of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5061)|
| 1:24:26| Keep Gridditt and Gibbs rural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5066)|
| 1:24:28| If you want affordable housing and high-density zoning, you can do it in the city of Knoxville, not in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5068)|
| 1:24:34| I hope you decide to delay this vote and allow for more time so the public has more input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5074)|
| 1:24:38| what you are planning to do to their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5078)|

| 1:24:44| We may have voted to have you represent us in the past, but if we the people feel that you are no longer doing your job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5084)|

| 1:28:00| I'm here on behalf of East Tennessee Realtors to speak in support of the proposed growth amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5280)|
| 1:28:04| The housing crisis is real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5284)|
| 1:28:06| Home prices have increased 85 percent since 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5286)|
| 1:28:10| So that equates to a $250,000 house in 2019 is now worth an average of $462,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5290)|
| 1:28:18| This is a crisis that touches the lives of our friends, our neighbors, our family and friends, and many of our city's most essential workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5298)|
| 1:28:26| Those who keep our community safe, who teach our kids, who respond to our medical emergencies, and the data bears it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5306)|
| 1:28:33| Our research shows that the starting salary for a sheriff's deputy is enough to afford just 2 percent of the homes listed for sale in Knox County today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5313)|
| 1:28:41| So I ask you, what happens when we don't have places to live for our law enforcement and do we really back the blue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5321)|
| 1:28:50| The starting salary for a KCS teacher, 2 percent of homes on the market are affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5330)|
| 1:28:56| What happens when we don't have teachers and places for them to live?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5336)|
| 1:29:00| The median salary for a registered nurse is enough to afford just 5 percent of the homes listed for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5340)|
| 1:29:06| What happens when we show up to the ER and we have to wait a while because we can't get enough nurses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5346)|
| 1:29:11| These are the people who are hurt the most when we fail to address the structural faults in our land-use system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5351)|
| 1:29:18| Make no mistake, this isn't an easy decision. Public decision-making is hard. It requires balancing nebulous concepts with community-wide needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5358)|
| 1:29:27| And while we have an obligation to listen carefully to our neighbors about their concerns, we also have to grapple with uncomfortable realities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5367)|
| 1:29:35| What happens when we say no to reforms to 20-year-old growth plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5375)|
| 1:29:39| Who are we really saying no to? Is it the young family looking for their first home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5379)|
| 1:29:44| The retiree searching for the place to live their golden years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5384)|
| 1:29:49| Or the young professional who defines our county's future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5389)|
| 1:29:54| To achieve a goal where our community is a place where all people can achieve a better life for themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5394)|
| 1:30:00| we have to grapple with the fact that our community has underproduced housing for more than 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5400)|
| 1:30:05| a symptom of our continued reliance on plans and policies that reflect the needs and priorities that are 20 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5405)|
| 1:30:15| And we have people saying that we need to rely on plans that are 20 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5415)|
| 1:30:21| We can't forget the amendments before you represent a healthy compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5421)|
| 1:30:25| We're reducing density in the vast majority of the rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5425)|
| 1:30:29| And this will be one time in my entire existence where you'll see me supporting something that is reducing density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5429)|
| 1:30:35| And it also is addressing our housing needs by making sure that we're enabling development potentials in places where infrastructure already exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5435)|
| 1:30:44| And we also can't forget the fact that these amendments didn't just come out of nowhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5444)|
| 1:30:50| They are the product of months and months of hard work from our county staff and planning staff and months and months of public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5450)|
| 1:30:58| For these reasons, our association asks that you vote to support these amendments as one of the many land use reforms that we have to make as a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5458)|
| 1:31:06| if we want to continue to be an affordable place to live, whether it be our police officers, our first responders, or teachers. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5466)|
| 1:31:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5474)|

| 1:31:27| Thank you. Amy Nolan on behalf of the Knoxville Chamber, 17 Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5487)|
| 1:31:32| Thank you, commissioners. Thank you, staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5492)|
| 1:31:35| Thank you, fellow members of the Growth Policy Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5495)|
| 1:31:38| This has been a very long process where we've sat through many, many hours of testimony, studies, stakeholders meeting, technical committee meetings, and many meetings throughout the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5498)|
| 1:31:52| Thank you, Mayor Jacobs, for bringing this amendment forward and recognizing that Knox County is growing and that growth isn't sustainable under our current land use rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5512)|
| 1:32:04| We can't stop growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5524)|
| 1:32:06| In fact, we need to accelerate growth among young professionals who are going to fill and create jobs and spend money on the things that keep our economy healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5526)|
| 1:32:17| We are actually not growing like our peer cities for those individuals 25 to 50 years old who find themselves priced out of our market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5537)|
| 1:32:27| For many of us, that is our children and our grandchildren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5547)|
| 1:32:31| We cannot have a litmus test or build a wall around to keep newcomers out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5551)|
| 1:32:38| If we could, even if we could, we would be left with a community where housing is increasingly unattainable for many people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5558)|
| 1:32:46| Our current guidelines already create sprawling subdivision and in many cases consume valuable green space and farmland without the proper roads and commercial hubs to support them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5566)|
| 1:33:00| This plan actually restricts development in the rural area, reduces density in the rural areas, and I will agree with Mr. Murphy, and I was questioning about this at a workshop, it is a gamble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5580)|
| 1:33:16| We are saying yes, reduce it in the rural areas, add more protection in the rural areas, but we are counting on a greater variety of place types, a greater variety of housing that is attainable for the people that Hanson just spoke about, as well as our children and our parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5596)|
| 1:33:38| Keeping to the status quo is estimated to result in an annual $2 million deficit for Knox County as infrastructure struggles to keep up with sprawl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5618)|
| 1:33:50| The current plan would save the county $4.8 million, money that can be used to invest in infrastructure, keep property taxes low, create more parks, and better pay our county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5630)|
| 1:34:04| Private property rights are a foundational principle of our organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5644)|
| 1:34:09| It's important to remember that no property owner loses their land or the use of their land under this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5649)|
| 1:34:16| Indeed, reducing sprawl and keeping property taxes low benefits all property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5656)|
| 1:34:23| Tonight's vote is an important step to ensuring Knox County will grow with appropriate infrastructure, more variety in housing, and a cost that is not burdensome for taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5663)|
| 1:34:35| Please vote yes tonight on the amendment. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5675)|
| 1:34:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5678)|

| 1:34:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5690)|
| 1:34:52| I'm Mr. Nigeli, Knox County. I'm president of the Foundation for Global Sustainability, and I've lived in Carnes for 26 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5692)|
| 1:35:02| Thank you for giving us the opportunity to speak to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5702)|
| 1:35:06| I have a PhD degree in natural resources policy and planning, and 20 years ago, actually 22 years ago, I was a citizen advisor for the Knox County General Plan 2033, which is currently still in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5706)|
| 1:35:22| More recently, I was a member of the Advanced Knox Advisory Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5722)|
| 1:35:27| Advanced Knox has been characterized to the public as an effort to define a vision and create a plan that will guide growth, land use, transportation, economic prosperity, and quality of life in the county for years to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5727)|
| 1:35:46| Let me repeat. Quality of life for years to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5746)|
| 1:35:52| While many in the community believe that growth has been occurring at a breathtaking pace, the development of public infrastructure, amenities, and services tends to go much slower, often taking decades, not just years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5752)|
| 1:36:07| What is most concerning about the proposed growth policy plan is that it appears to have been developed in oblivion of the unparalleled uncertainties that the world and our county face today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5767)|
| 1:36:22| Warning signs are abounding that global warming may be headed to a three-degree increase or beyond, instead of merely 1.5 to 2 degrees, as has been heavily debated in recent times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5782)|
| 1:36:44| Yet, climate change, ecosystem vulnerability, biodiversity, landscape ecology, and community sustainability are not addressed at all in the proposed plan, or both of the plans, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5804)|
| 1:37:00| Also, Advanced Knox has failed to assess likely socioeconomic policy outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5820)|
| 1:37:08| That's a hallmark of good planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5828)|
| 1:37:11| Community resilience of natural hazards is mentioned merely in the context of public parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5831)|
| 1:37:18| How about assuring it for existing neighborhoods?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5838)|
| 1:37:24| How about determining what first responders will need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5844)|
| 1:37:30| Heat alone can cause chronic illness and death from heat exhaustion, kidney damage, heart attack, or stroke, as pointed out by a recent Harvard study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5850)|
| 1:37:39| Also, children suffering burns from stepping on hot balconies or touching items heated by the sun are increasingly common.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5859)|
| 1:37:49| ERs in Arizona and other southwestern areas have reported seeing adults, too, who stumbled and fell on hot pavement, even presenting second-degree burns if they had passed out or could not get up immediately without help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5869)|
| 1:38:07| Stewardship of good agricultural land and prime soils is somewhat an important topic that we owe future generations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5887)|
| 1:38:18| It is something that, for all practical purposes, is irreversible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5898)|
| 1:38:24| So I urge you that you consider your children, your grandchildren, and your grandchildren's grandchildren in making a decision, and we'll make sure that you understand what's missing in these plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5904)|
| 1:38:40| Thank you, sir. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5920)|
| 1:38:42| Martha Kern, Mike Mitchell, Megan Howard, Amanda Cruz, and Harry Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5922)|
| 1:38:54| Martha Kern, Knox County. I'm Rutledge Pike, and I'm a farmer, and I know you all are working on tweaking the plan because for 20 years I've tried to tell you I'm not going to subdivide my farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5934)|
| 1:39:09| And I think I found out today it was taken off the plan as a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5949)|
| 1:39:16| But I just wanted to address what this does to farms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5956)|
| 1:39:21| It's a slow death for farms if you don't control the growth in some form that protects farmland, because I'm pushed to other counties for supplies, and I sell 30,000 pounds of meat 10 miles from my farm, but I have to drive 150 miles to process it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5961)|
| 1:39:49| Everything is getting pushed out because there are not enough customers here to support the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5989)|
| 1:39:56| And if we keep doing it, it's going to be the death of local agriculture, and I just feel like the plan is not looking enough at in-growth and protecting some of these producers that are still producing food in our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=5996)|
| 1:40:15| Your food doesn't come from the grocery store. It comes from a farmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6015)|
| 1:40:21| And the supply chain can get messed up, and I just don't want to live someplace where there's no local food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6021)|
| 1:40:31| And I just hope that you'll think about some of these things, and it doesn't matter whether you put one house per acre or 50 houses per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6031)|
| 1:40:41| Once you put all those houses on it, it's never going to go back into agricultural production.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6041)|
| 1:40:46| So just think about long-term and what you're going to eat and where it's going to come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6046)|
| 1:40:54| That's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6054)|
| 1:40:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6055)|
| 1:41:03| Mr. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6063)|
| 1:41:06| Good evening, Madam Chair, esteemed commissioners. My name is Mike Mitchell. I'm a Knox County resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6066)|
| 1:41:12| And to the people who've spoken tonight, I'd like to see you after the meeting's over and get your contact information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6072)|
| 1:41:18| This is not the last body that will vote on this. The town of Farragut still has a vote on March 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6078)|
| 1:41:25| And I want to speak to you about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6085)|
| 1:41:27| I want to speak to you about a workshop that the Board of Mayor and Aldermen had last Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6087)|
| 1:41:32| And one of the most important things was what Vice Mayor Pavlin said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6092)|
| 1:41:36| As you recall, in 2020, the town of Farragut voted down the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6096)|
| 1:41:42| And they did so out of an act of self-preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6102)|
| 1:41:46| As we look at the map, you'll see Choteau is in yellow in the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6106)|
| 1:41:50| And that's a problem because North Shore is a very, very dangerous road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6110)|
| 1:41:57| It has over 17,000 cars a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6117)|
| 1:42:00| The crash rate between roundabout to roundabout is above the state average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6120)|
| 1:42:06| The Tennessee Department of Transportation reports between 2018 and 2022 that accidents have increased 39 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6126)|
| 1:42:15| Most of the accidents occurred in daylight hours, 64 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6135)|
| 1:42:20| Clear weather conditions, 71 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6140)|
| 1:42:24| And along the roadway, not near an intersection, 84 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6144)|
| 1:42:29| So what Vice Mayor Pavlin was saying, you have to understand that Choteau is a suburb of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6149)|
| 1:42:37| It's not a suburb of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6157)|
| 1:42:40| And since 1995, we've had explosive growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6160)|
| 1:42:45| But that road is unchanged for 55 years with the exception of two roundabouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6165)|
| 1:42:50| Commissioner Schoonmaker got us a turn lane at the cove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6170)|
| 1:42:55| And there's going to be a very small widening in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6175)|
| 1:42:59| So 55 years, we haven't changed that roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6179)|
| 1:43:03| It is the major east-west connection to Choteau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6183)|
| 1:43:05| What happens when there's a wreck there? We get gridlock in Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6185)|
| 1:43:09| After the workshop in the Board of Mayor and Aldermen meeting, I spoke with Michelle Portier of the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6189)|
| 1:43:17| Right now under the sector plan, Choteau is at three units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6197)|
| 1:43:21| So I said, what happens in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6201)|
| 1:43:23| And she explained how advanced Knox is an overlay that's over the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6203)|
| 1:43:28| She said that she expected that Choteau would go from three units an acre to five units an acre in some places, up to 12 units an acre in other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6208)|
| 1:43:39| So we're talking about flooding Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6219)|
| 1:43:42| Every time there's an accident on North Shore, I can't get out of my subdivision because people are coming down Harvey Choteau, going to Boyd Station, going to Virtue, going down Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6222)|
| 1:43:52| Now we can't get out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6232)|
| 1:43:53| I ask you to vote this down because the process, Mr. Silverstein made it very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6233)|
| 1:43:59| This is an incremental process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6239)|
| 1:44:01| It should have been done in a more holistic relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6241)|
| 1:44:05| And the problem is you're not going to discuss the density for 12 to 18 months after the advanced Knox is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6245)|
| 1:44:13| I ask you to vote this down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6253)|
| 1:44:15| It's not good for public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6255)|
| 1:44:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6257)|
| 1:44:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6258)|
| 1:44:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6262)|
| 1:44:26| Megan Howard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6266)|
| 1:44:31| It's hard to follow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6271)|
| 1:44:33| Megan Howard, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6273)|
| 1:44:36| I have been involved in all the community meetings and participate in the public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6276)|
| 1:44:40| So I'm very thankful for your time this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6280)|
| 1:44:43| I'm sure a lot of it is reverb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6283)|
| 1:44:45| I have lived in Knox County for 19 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6285)|
| 1:44:48| I'm a resident for over 35, and I can assure you as a hospital employee, availability is not affordability for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6288)|
| 1:44:55| During my time in Knox County, I have seen major implications from large, fast growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6295)|
| 1:45:00| The character of our area is in danger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6300)|
| 1:45:03| As it stands, this plan feels very developer-driven to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6303)|
| 1:45:07| There doesn't seem to be any guidelines that assure we can keep the open and rural spaces that we love and drew us to this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6307)|
| 1:45:14| We are already inundated with multiple thousands of road trips from recent developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6314)|
| 1:45:19| Thompson Meadows alone estimated over 3,000 trips prior to building, and all Thompson School Road got was a stoplight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6319)|
| 1:45:26| While having the opportunity to address the Planning Commission, I did not feel heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6326)|
| 1:45:31| I felt like an obligation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6331)|
| 1:45:33| So I thank you for listening, as in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6333)|
| 1:45:35| Were there any boots on the ground in our area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6335)|
| 1:45:38| Did anybody sit on Washington Pike between 4.30 and 5.30?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6338)|
| 1:45:40| Have you tried to drop your kid off at Gibbs Elementary at 7 or tried to leave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6340)|
| 1:45:45| Washington Pike and Tazewell Pike are one way in and one way out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6345)|
| 1:45:49| They are overpopulated and overused, and we're seeing the domino effect on our side roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6349)|
| 1:45:54| If you've been out to northeast Knox County and driven Link, Harris, or Babley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6354)|
| 1:45:58| you know that the 1,800-plus trips estimated from that development will be detrimental to those roads on which two cars can barely pass, much less a school bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6358)|
| 1:46:07| Recently purchased land out by Roberts Road is really pushing the bubble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6367)|
| 1:46:13| We can see the direction Planning Commission is trying to go in the future when they're reaching that far into the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6373)|
| 1:46:19| Because once this green space is gone, there is no getting it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6379)|
| 1:46:23| As of right now, we feel that we're in a gray no-man's land, and for the residents in this area, that's terrifying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6383)|
| 1:46:30| I live across the street from one of the largest undeveloped plots in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6390)|
| 1:46:34| that thought that someone could honestly plop down a town center right in the middle of all ag-zoned properties is unbelievable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6394)|
| 1:46:42| It's almost as though the current residents will lose every attribute that lured them into this area for the group of proposed residents that do not even live here yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6402)|
| 1:46:51| Maloneyville and Riga residents still do not have a middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6411)|
| 1:46:55| Children are still being bused to Holston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6415)|
| 1:46:57| Growing faster than our infrastructure ensures overcrowded schools, children in portable classrooms, increased time of response from emergency services, light noise, and trash pollution, all while we're playing catch-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6417)|
| 1:47:12| There are no plans on the books other than future mobility studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6432)|
| 1:47:16| We have zero parks or green spaces allocated in the most recent park plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6436)|
| 1:47:20| Please allow the comprehensive plan time to catch up and really get some teeth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6440)|
| 1:47:24| We love where we live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6444)|
| 1:47:25| It is essential to our future, and the future of the character of our community deserves our farmland and green spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6445)|
| 1:47:32| That is why we moved here, and that is why we love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6452)|
| 1:47:35| This is not a take-it-or-leave-it situation, as we were made to believe at prior forums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6455)|
| 1:47:40| I would hate for my daughter to see us pave paradise to put up a parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6460)|
| 1:47:43| Amanda Cruz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6463)|
| 1:47:45| Amanda Cruz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6465)|
| 1:47:47| Followed by Representative Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6467)|
| 1:47:51| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6471)|
| 1:47:53| Thank you for the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6473)|

| 1:48:11| I own some property in the Rita community, as well as a small agriculture business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6491)|
| 1:48:17| I own a flower farm, and we grow and sell cut flowers to the local community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6497)|
| 1:48:23| We actually have a booth at Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6503)|
| 1:48:26| And so, when I see these growth plans, like a lot of my neighbors, I get concerned about our ability to continue to farm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6506)|
| 1:48:34| and to do, to continue to have that agriculture-based economy here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6514)|
| 1:48:44| And I think that sustainability in a community goes a lot deeper than housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6524)|
| 1:48:50| I think that when we think about sustainability, we also need to think about how we're going to feed our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6530)|
| 1:48:56| about local businesses, local agriculture businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6536)|
| 1:48:59| And those are all things that are a concern to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6539)|
| 1:49:02| And so, I just wanted to come tonight, and thank you all for the work that you've done so far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6542)|
| 1:49:09| but also encourage you to continue to look at this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6549)|
| 1:49:13| and make sure that it's a comprehensive plan that allows for those of us who still want to farm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6553)|
| 1:49:20| and are still interested in local sustainability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6560)|
| 1:49:23| The farmer's market is one of our greatest assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6563)|
| 1:49:25| We have one of the best farmer's markets of, like, anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6565)|
| 1:49:29| And I love being a part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6569)|
| 1:49:31| And I'm afraid that if we continue to develop a lot of our agriculture lands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6571)|
| 1:49:36| that we won't have local farmers, and that we'll have to go outside of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6576)|
| 1:49:41| to be able to sustain such a great farmer's market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6581)|
| 1:49:44| And we already do that some, and that's great for those outlying counties to be able to sell here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6584)|
| 1:49:50| But we need to keep some of that here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6590)|
| 1:49:52| So, I appreciate the time, and thank you all for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6592)|
| 1:49:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6597)|
| 1:50:07| Representative Brooks, you have the floor for three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6607)|
| 1:50:11| Harry Brooks, 6600 Washington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6611)|
| 1:50:14| I want to thank you for taking this extraordinary amount of time to listen to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6614)|
| 1:50:19| While I'm not excited to live in the proposed urban growth zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6619)|
| 1:50:23| I realize that some growth is going to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6623)|
| 1:50:26| The issue becomes, how do we grow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6626)|
| 1:50:29| And the variables to be considered in making that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6629)|
| 1:50:34| I'm a retired Knox County Sheriff's Department employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6634)|
| 1:50:37| and I was working there during the unprecedented growth in West Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6637)|
| 1:50:42| and also in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6642)|
| 1:50:43| The growth process then was very poorly managed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6643)|
| 1:50:47| resulting in many home burglaries, a significant increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6647)|
| 1:50:51| building material thefts, horrendous traffic problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6651)|
| 1:50:55| Do we want to see something like this occur with this plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6655)|
| 1:51:00| Plans on how we grow are critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6660)|
| 1:51:04| How we grow are critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6664)|
| 1:51:07| Washington, Pike, and Baby Road are parts of the area's Ridge and Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6667)|
| 1:51:10| Each valley has a major east-west road and a creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6670)|
| 1:51:14| which are prone to flooding in the valleys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6674)|
| 1:51:17| Our ridges during the summer and the spring provide a beautiful canopy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6677)|
| 1:51:21| and with reds and golds in the falls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6681)|
| 1:51:24| These ridges define our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6684)|
| 1:51:27| How should we grow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6687)|
| 1:51:29| Should we be allowed to build on the slopes of these ridges?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6689)|
| 1:51:32| Should we manipulate the flood zones for building purposes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6692)|
| 1:51:36| Should the housing units per acre be calculated on usable land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6696)|
| 1:51:40| or include the floodplains and the ridges?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6700)|
| 1:51:44| The urban growth area's service providers need to clearly issue a clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6704)|
| 1:51:49| and accurate report as to availability of water, electricity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6709)|
| 1:51:54| and sewage current capacities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6714)|
| 1:51:58| The service providers should also provide plans for additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6718)|
| 1:52:01| population growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6721)|
| 1:52:05| Sewer development should also include additional plans previously proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6725)|
| 1:52:09| but not implemented for use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6729)|
| 1:52:13| For example, the proposed Murphy Creek range basin sewer extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6733)|
| 1:52:17| The Sheriff's Department needs to provide a patrol zone analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6737)|
| 1:52:21| projecting the growth in housing and population to how many more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6741)|
| 1:52:25| officers will be needed in regard to that particular circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6745)|
| 1:52:28| Each school in the area needs to report current capacity of how many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6748)|
| 1:52:32| more students they have room for as relates to the urban growth zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6752)|
| 1:52:37| Traffic on the roads in this area, especially Washington Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6757)|
| 1:52:42| is horrendous in those rush hour time frames.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6762)|
| 1:52:46| I am asking for information to help us determine how we can best grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6766)|
| 1:52:50| More details are important before any definitive decisions can be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6770)|
| 1:52:54| Please allow more discussion for the specifics before we determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6774)|
| 1:52:58| what is best for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6778)|
| 1:53:02| How we grow is critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6782)|
| 1:53:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6786)|
| 1:53:18| I really appreciate that you all have come out here and that you've sat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6798)|
| 1:53:21| and listened to everyone else speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6801)|
| 1:53:25| One announcement that I'm going to make that I don't believe our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6805)|
| 1:53:29| commissioners even know yet that certainly speaks directly to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6809)|
| 1:53:33| things that you have referred to and that is the comprehensive plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6813)|
| 1:53:37| and what needs to occur to have that tie with the growth plan that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6817)|
| 1:53:41| on the agenda tonight for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6821)|
| 1:53:45| Regardless of whether or not you are a member of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6825)|
| 1:53:48| I want you all to know and I also want the commissioners to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6828)|
| 1:53:52| this has not been public noticed yet, but on March 21st at 2 o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6832)|
| 1:53:56| we will be having a workshop for the comprehensive plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6836)|
| 1:54:00| and it will be a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6840)|
| 1:54:04| Commissioners and planning staff speaking with us directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6844)|
| 1:54:08| It will be a great time for questions and comments to be made at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6848)|
| 1:54:12| time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6852)|
| 1:54:15| Moving forward, if there are no objections from other commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6855)|
| 1:54:19| we are scheduled to start our zoning meeting at 7 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6859)|
| 1:54:23| I do not really feel like there is time at this point in time to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6863)|
| 1:54:27| address all the comments that I'm sure commissioners have to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6867)|
| 1:54:31| Commissioners, I'm proposing that we have a meeting at 7 o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6871)|
| 1:54:35| and we will have that meeting at 7 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6875)|
| 1:54:39| I do not really feel like there is time at this point in time to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6879)|
| 1:54:42| address all the comments that I'm sure commissioners have to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6882)|
| 1:54:46| Commissioners, I'm proposing that we recess this meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6886)|
| 1:54:50| and begin zoning at 7.10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6890)|
| 1:54:54| and of course after zoning we will come together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6894)|
| 1:54:58| and continue with this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6898)|
| 1:55:02| Do I see any objections to that plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6902)|
| 1:55:06| Seeing none, then we are recessed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6906)|
| 1:55:09| I just had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6909)|
| 1:55:13| Does this mean that we are going to come back to this after zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6913)|
| 1:55:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6917)|
| 1:55:21| Zoning is public notice at 7 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6921)|
| 1:55:25| That is something that is beyond our control at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6925)|
| 1:55:29| Zoning is public notice at 7 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=6929)|

| 1:57:45| You were always receptive to me and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7065)|
| 1:57:49| I want to thank the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7069)|
| 1:57:52| I want to thank the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7072)|
| 1:57:56| I was the pesky citizen with the planning advocates group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7076)|
| 1:58:00| asking our county to take a hard look at the way we approach land use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7080)|
| 1:58:04| growth and our transportation network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7084)|
| 1:58:08| For the first time in our county history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7088)|
| 1:58:12| this plan looks at growth and transportation together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7092)|
| 1:58:16| and not in silos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7096)|
| 1:58:19| I want to thank all of the advocates, especially Kevin Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7099)|
| 1:58:23| You participated as a stakeholder on the stakeholder committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7103)|
| 1:58:27| You were a part of many conversations and meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7107)|
| 1:58:31| with the leadership team over the last 20 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7111)|
| 1:58:35| I want to thank all of the citizens who served on the stakeholder committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7115)|
| 1:58:39| the advisory committee, the coordinating committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7119)|
| 1:58:43| and every citizen who came out for public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7123)|
| 1:58:46| This is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7126)|
| 1:58:50| As a citizen, like I said, I advocated for updating our plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7130)|
| 1:58:54| and our zoning ordinances through multiple mayors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7134)|
| 1:58:58| That's a long time of being a voice for improving our approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7138)|
| 1:59:02| to growth and development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7142)|
| 1:59:06| This effort is what I and several of the planning advocacy groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7146)|
| 1:59:10| what we asked for. Is it a perfect process? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7150)|
| 1:59:13| Is everyone happy? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7153)|
| 1:59:17| But I can confidently say that this path forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7157)|
| 1:59:21| is much, much better than what we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7161)|
| 1:59:25| And I'm just grateful to be able to be a part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7165)|
| 1:59:29| With that said, I want to take a few moments to point out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7169)|
| 1:59:33| some of the things that I and many of my colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7173)|
| 1:59:37| especially Commissioner Beeler and the eighth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7177)|
| 1:59:40| have done with the support of the mayor and the leadership team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7180)|
| 1:59:44| on behalf of the advocacy groups and constituents countywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7184)|
| 1:59:48| So thanks for your patience, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7188)|
| 1:59:52| I'm going to kind of go through these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7192)|
| 1:59:56| The total expanded planned growth area was reduced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7196)|
| 2:00:00| to include 14.501 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7200)|
| 2:00:04| In total, as a county, we will have 151.34 square miles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7204)|
| 2:00:07| We have proposed expanded growth area changes in Carnes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7207)|
| 2:00:11| which is a less than a quarter of a square mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7211)|
| 2:00:15| Hardin Valley, 4.6 square miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7215)|
| 2:00:19| That is land that already has construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7219)|
| 2:00:23| is completed construction or has building permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7223)|
| 2:00:27| that have been pulled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7227)|
| 2:00:31| Washington Pike, 7.6 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7231)|
| 2:00:34| Strawberry Plains Pike, south of I-40,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7234)|
| 2:00:38| .61 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7238)|
| 2:00:42| And Chapman Highway, 1.3 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7242)|
| 2:00:46| Another thing we did, we were able to pull back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7246)|
| 2:00:50| some of the proposed planned growth areas into rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7250)|
| 2:00:54| We did that in North Gibbs along Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7254)|
| 2:00:58| We did that along Ridgeview Heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7258)|
| 2:01:01| We did that along Ridgeview in Rita.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7261)|
| 2:01:05| And we did that in Seymour in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7265)|
| 2:01:09| The hillside and ridgetop protection, it will be included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7269)|
| 2:01:13| And it can be changed from advisory to regulatory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7273)|
| 2:01:17| by a commission vote in the comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7277)|
| 2:01:21| And I do plan to support making it regulatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7281)|
| 2:01:25| We were able to limit rezonings allowed in the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7285)|
| 2:01:28| Rezonings within the rural area shall be limited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7288)|
| 2:01:32| to zoning districts that are consistent with the following place types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7292)|
| 2:01:36| Rural crossroads, rural conservation, and rural living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7296)|
| 2:01:40| We were able to add a rural agricultural place type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7300)|
| 2:01:44| High level, this will include more protections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7304)|
| 2:01:48| for our historic century farms, our legacy farms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7308)|
| 2:01:52| land along the Holston River, and we'll consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7312)|
| 2:01:55| the soil map. I wish Broadus was here to hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7315)|
| 2:01:59| We will consider the soil map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7319)|
| 2:02:03| We have amended the flume, which is the future land use map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7323)|
| 2:02:07| to include more rural living place types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7327)|
| 2:02:11| that will reduce density in areas with rural character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7331)|
| 2:02:15| That includes areas in Choteau and North Shore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7335)|
| 2:02:19| and the peninsula, just as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7339)|
| 2:02:22| The map's now available on advanceknots.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7342)|
| 2:02:26| We were able to place conditions on types of residential development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7346)|
| 2:02:30| in rural areas. Residential development in the rural area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7350)|
| 2:02:34| shall be limited to all of the following conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7354)|
| 2:02:38| A, no more than two dwellings per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7358)|
| 2:02:42| B, sanitary sewer or sewage system approved and maintained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7362)|
| 2:02:46| by a public utility company and public water must be available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7366)|
| 2:02:49| C, built a road with a minimum width of 18-foot pavement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7369)|
| 2:02:53| or with an approved memorandum of understanding in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7373)|
| 2:02:57| to improve the road to 18 feet or greater through the rural area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7377)|
| 2:03:01| to the adjacent planned growth or urban growth area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7381)|
| 2:03:05| and as defined by the major road plan or superseding documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7385)|
| 2:03:09| adopted by a city council and county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7389)|
| 2:03:13| The intent of this section is to allow residential development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7393)|
| 2:03:16| that are currently available or to be expanded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7396)|
| 2:03:20| We were able to restrict business parks or industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7400)|
| 2:03:24| in the rural area. We were able to strengthen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7404)|
| 2:03:28| the focus of impact on schools and place the burden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7408)|
| 2:03:32| on the applicant during the application process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7412)|
| 2:03:36| So we will require the applicant to justify the change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7416)|
| 2:03:40| for the plan amendment and add in new criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7420)|
| 2:03:43| so that the proposed change has to further the goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7423)|
| 2:03:47| and objectives of the comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7427)|
| 2:03:51| We were able to tweak section 7 of the proposed comp plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7431)|
| 2:03:55| to include preservation of rural character and natural heritage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7435)|
| 2:03:59| We set an agreed upon May 1st effective date and this was discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7439)|
| 2:04:03| and agreed upon during several meetings with the leadership team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7443)|
| 2:04:07| and advocacy groups. We were able to tighten requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7447)|
| 2:04:10| in the planned growth areas. We were able to allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7450)|
| 2:04:14| rural place types in the planned growth areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7454)|
| 2:04:18| which was not originally proposed. We were able to include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7458)|
| 2:04:22| regular review of the comp plan and the growth plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7462)|
| 2:04:26| keeping us accountable and monitoring the implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7466)|
| 2:04:30| In addition, Mayor Jacobs introduced a local initiative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7470)|
| 2:04:34| to assist landowners with the cost of purchasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7474)|
| 2:04:37| a rural conservation easement which supports the governor's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7477)|
| 2:04:41| introduction of the state PACE program that this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7481)|
| 2:04:45| put as one of our legislative priorities to our state delegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7485)|
| 2:04:49| I agree and support aligning the comp plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7489)|
| 2:04:53| with the growth policy plan and map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7493)|
| 2:04:57| and that's what I hope we do tonight. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7497)|
| 2:05:01| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7501)|
| 2:05:04| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7504)|
| 2:05:08| As the commissioner for the district that's most affected by this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7508)|
| 2:05:12| if the gentleman has a question or so, I'll be glad to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7512)|
| 2:05:16| yield and speak last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7516)|
| 2:05:20| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7520)|
| 2:05:24| This is a question for Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7524)|
| 2:05:28| This is my first meeting so I really don't know about a lot of these names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7528)|
| 2:05:31| What does the growth policy plan is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7531)|
| 2:05:35| and what's the comprehensive plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7535)|
| 2:05:39| and what's the similarities and differences between both?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7539)|
| 2:05:43| The growth policy plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7543)|
| 2:05:47| is a plan that is required by the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7547)|
| 2:05:51| What it does is it requires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7551)|
| 2:05:55| communities to identify areas that are designated as rural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7555)|
| 2:05:58| and areas that are designated for future growth, which is planned growth area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7558)|
| 2:06:02| and also identifies what we call urban growth areas as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7562)|
| 2:06:06| Those are primarily city of Knoxville here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7566)|
| 2:06:10| So it is a very high level plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7570)|
| 2:06:14| It does not provide a lot of details related to some of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7574)|
| 2:06:18| that you all have discussed tonight, such as rezonings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7578)|
| 2:06:22| but it is that first layer of plans that's required in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7582)|
| 2:06:25| The comprehensive plan is a more detailed plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7585)|
| 2:06:29| a guide for future development over the next 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7589)|
| 2:06:33| It does get into a lot more details. It discusses policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7593)|
| 2:06:37| It's meant to articulate the vision of a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7597)|
| 2:06:41| How do we want to grow? Where do we want to grow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7601)|
| 2:06:45| What should that growth look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7605)|
| 2:06:49| In turn, it will help inform zoning, which you have talked about this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7609)|
| 2:06:52| as well as something that's called the subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7612)|
| 2:06:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7616)|
| 2:07:00| Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you for that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7620)|
| 2:07:04| It's very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7624)|
| 2:07:08| Thank you guys for still being here because I know what these nights are like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7628)|
| 2:07:12| I have been through worse ones than this in terms of the lateness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7632)|
| 2:07:16| So thank you for staying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7636)|
| 2:07:19| I do want to make a few comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7639)|
| 2:07:23| By the way, thank you for being involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7643)|
| 2:07:27| I know Commissioner Frazier has already said this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7647)|
| 2:07:31| but I want to say it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7651)|
| 2:07:35| You guys have called, you've emailed, you've texted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7655)|
| 2:07:39| you've showed up, and you have moved the needle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7659)|
| 2:07:43| I congratulate you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7663)|
| 2:07:46| I love this community because I know most of you are from the Ritta-Gibbs-Coreyton area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7666)|
| 2:07:50| which is where I'm from, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7670)|
| 2:07:54| I love where we live. I love where I live with all my heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7674)|
| 2:07:58| I've lived there 60 years, almost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7678)|
| 2:08:02| My family has lived there for over 200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7682)|
| 2:08:06| I never intend to live anywhere else until I die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7686)|
| 2:08:10| Even after that, you can still come see me at the gravestone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7690)|
| 2:08:13| I'm really blessed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7693)|
| 2:08:17| My brother and I have houses on the 21 acres that's left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7697)|
| 2:08:21| of our grandfather's farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7701)|
| 2:08:25| That is 21 acres that will not be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7705)|
| 2:08:29| I do hope that many of my neighbors treat their land the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7709)|
| 2:08:33| Now, here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7713)|
| 2:08:37| We have a growth plan in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7717)|
| 2:08:40| Or a growth policy plan amendment in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7720)|
| 2:08:44| Commissioner Frazier did a very eloquent job explaining how this process has worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7724)|
| 2:08:48| and some of the really good things that have come out of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7728)|
| 2:08:52| I am going to ask a few questions to Mr. Snowden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7732)|
| 2:08:56| and perhaps to Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7736)|
| 2:09:00| No offense, Kathy, you may have the answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7740)|
| 2:09:04| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7744)|
| 2:09:07| I'm asking these questions not to be combative at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7747)|
| 2:09:11| I'm asking these questions to get us to a place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7751)|
| 2:09:15| that's going to lead to the proposal I'm going to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7755)|
| 2:09:19| I think it's important that we understand, Commissioner Frazier made the comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7759)|
| 2:09:23| very early on, what we have now is not good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7763)|
| 2:09:27| I just cannot emphasize that enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7767)|
| 2:09:31| I'm asking these questions to make sure we understand that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7771)|
| 2:09:34| and where we're headed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7774)|
| 2:09:38| So, Mr. Snowden, Mandy, whoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7778)|
| 2:09:42| If I own a farm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7782)|
| 2:09:46| in what is going to be the expanded planned growth area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7786)|
| 2:09:50| along, let's say, in the Washington Pike corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7790)|
| 2:09:54| let's say I own a 50-acre farm and I decide that I need to develop that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7794)|
| 2:09:58| or sell it to somebody who's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7798)|
| 2:10:01| have three units per acre, 150 homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7801)|
| 2:10:05| and it's in the new planned growth area and I've got sewer and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7805)|
| 2:10:09| could I make that application and possibly get that approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7809)|
| 2:10:13| Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7813)|
| 2:10:17| The process would remain the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7817)|
| 2:10:21| So, if you want to change the zoning on your property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7821)|
| 2:10:25| or if the comprehensive plan is updating your place type,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7825)|
| 2:10:28| currently called Lane Use Classification, you still have to go through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7828)|
| 2:10:32| Planning Commission and make your request and you'd have to be required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7832)|
| 2:10:36| to provide some justification and then it would come before this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7836)|
| 2:10:40| for review and approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7840)|
| 2:10:44| But I could possibly get that amount of density if I'm in the new planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7844)|
| 2:10:48| growth area, correct? Three per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7848)|
| 2:10:52| Possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7852)|
| 2:10:55| If we do nothing, we stay on the current plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7855)|
| 2:10:59| And now I'm in a rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7859)|
| 2:11:03| I've got 50 acres and I want to develop it at three units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7863)|
| 2:11:07| 150 homes. I can get sewer to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7867)|
| 2:11:11| I can do some other things that I need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7871)|
| 2:11:15| Could I apply for three units per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7875)|
| 2:11:19| Let's just make sure I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7879)|
| 2:11:22| Three units per acre, you would have to do a traffic impact letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7882)|
| 2:11:26| but yes, that could be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7886)|
| 2:11:30| Thank you. And that's what I want to make sure that we all know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7890)|
| 2:11:34| It's because under the current plan, our rural areas are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7894)|
| 2:11:38| protected like they need to be at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7898)|
| 2:11:42| And my big concern is if we do nothing at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7902)|
| 2:11:46| and we stay under this current plan that's 20 plus years old now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7906)|
| 2:11:49| for years to come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7909)|
| 2:11:53| ultimately we could end up with three per acre subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7913)|
| 2:11:57| all the way to Grainger County. We could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7917)|
| 2:12:01| So that's why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7921)|
| 2:12:05| I believe the best path forward has to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7925)|
| 2:12:09| with what Commissioner Frazier talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7929)|
| 2:12:13| what several of the speakers talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7933)|
| 2:12:16| and that is to move forward with a new plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7936)|
| 2:12:20| but a new plan that is undergirded and working in tandem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7940)|
| 2:12:24| with the right comprehensive plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7944)|
| 2:12:28| that adds those guardrails and those protections for our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7948)|
| 2:12:32| farmland, our hillsides, our ridgetops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7952)|
| 2:12:36| our rural landscapes, all the things Commissioner Frazier mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7956)|
| 2:12:40| and that I know are important to us in Northeast Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7960)|
| 2:12:43| but it's important to Rita, Gibbs, Coryton, and East Knox County as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7963)|
| 2:12:47| And so for that reason, this is what I'm proposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7967)|
| 2:12:51| and I'm looking to my colleagues and I'm really hoping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7971)|
| 2:12:55| that you guys will approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7975)|
| 2:12:59| I want to offer a substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7979)|
| 2:13:03| that we approve the growth policy plan amendment resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7983)|
| 2:13:07| contingent upon approval of a new comprehensive plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7987)|
| 2:13:10| and that they shall take effect concurrently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7990)|
| 2:13:14| so they'll provide the proper standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7994)|
| 2:13:18| and protections that we need for our rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=7998)|
| 2:13:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8002)|
| 2:13:26| We have a substitute motion on the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8006)|
| 2:13:30| with a second by Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8010)|
| 2:13:34| Do we have some discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8014)|
| 2:13:37| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8017)|
| 2:13:41| Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you, Mr. Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8021)|
| 2:13:45| And thank you, Ms. Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8025)|
| 2:13:49| I think you're taking a room full of ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8029)|
| 2:13:53| and starting to focus, which I think is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8033)|
| 2:13:57| Mr. Snowden or Ms. Brooks, could you help us understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8037)|
| 2:14:01| if the substitute motion of the approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8041)|
| 2:14:04| contingent upon the comprehensive plan's approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8044)|
| 2:14:08| is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8048)|
| 2:14:12| Just making sure I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8052)|
| 2:14:16| How that would affect the vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8056)|
| 2:14:20| and the timing in the city of Knoxville, Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8060)|
| 2:14:24| and what would happen if the comprehensive plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8064)|
| 2:14:28| wasn't approved and how that would affect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8068)|
| 2:14:31| sort of the ripple effect going backwards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8071)|
| 2:14:35| Or Ms. Benedict, whoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8075)|
| 2:14:39| Even if you place the comprehensive plan contingent condition on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8079)|
| 2:14:43| it would still move to city council in the town of Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8083)|
| 2:14:47| and then the comprehensive plan would still go before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8087)|
| 2:14:51| planning commission in March and then you guys would see it in March also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8091)|
| 2:14:55| And then if that was approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8095)|
| 2:14:58| is there a timeline that it becomes effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8098)|
| 2:15:02| that all of these are trying to hit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8102)|
| 2:15:06| We have to get the growth policy approved within six months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8106)|
| 2:15:10| of the first committee meeting based on state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8110)|
| 2:15:14| Which is? It would be May 27th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8114)|
| 2:15:18| Okay. So it still keeps us in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8118)|
| 2:15:22| even in this scenario, it keeps us within our window of opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8122)|
| 2:15:25| to not go back and start from zero. Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8125)|
| 2:15:29| Okay. I have some other thoughts, but I'm going to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8129)|
| 2:15:33| Thank you. Are there any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8133)|
| 2:15:37| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8137)|
| 2:15:41| Thank you. If I may. Thank you. Appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8141)|
| 2:15:45| No, I do want to I want to go back to what Mr. Brooks said, Representative Brooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8145)|
| 2:15:49| about how we grow is what is so important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8149)|
| 2:15:52| As Director Brooks described it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8152)|
| 2:15:56| It is the one that is so much more detailed that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8156)|
| 2:16:00| talks about infrastructure, talks about place types,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8160)|
| 2:16:04| talks about standards, talks about all the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8164)|
| 2:16:08| that we don't want a new growth policy plan going into effect without.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8168)|
| 2:16:12| And that's why I think it's so vital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8172)|
| 2:16:16| As Mr. Murphy said, I think a couple of other speakers said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8176)|
| 2:16:19| that they go into effect concurrently and that we roll our sleeves up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8179)|
| 2:16:23| and get in the mix on the comprehensive plan and make sure that it's what it needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8183)|
| 2:16:27| And we got, you know, two months or however long it takes, I guess, to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8187)|
| 2:16:31| We've got to do it for May 27th, I suppose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8191)|
| 2:16:35| But we got to do it. And a lot of work's been done on it already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8195)|
| 2:16:39| It's not like we vote tonight and then we start from scratch on the comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8199)|
| 2:16:43| It's the nuts and bolts or the skeleton of it's been up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8203)|
| 2:16:46| on the website since October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8206)|
| 2:16:50| We just got to add some teeth to it and some regulatory language to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8210)|
| 2:16:54| so that it's not just a guideline and our growth plan has no protections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8214)|
| 2:16:58| And that's why we need these to go into effect concurrently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8218)|
| 2:17:02| But to postpone this is extremely dangerous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8222)|
| 2:17:06| because, again, it puts that May deadline in great jeopardy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8226)|
| 2:17:10| because it's got to go before three bodies between now and May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8230)|
| 2:17:13| And to postpone it for 60 days, we could very well end up with nothing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8233)|
| 2:17:17| which means we're not protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8237)|
| 2:17:21| Believe me, just because there's not been all this development yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8241)|
| 2:17:25| it's not because of the protections of the current plan we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8245)|
| 2:17:29| It's in spite of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8249)|
| 2:17:33| And if you think I'm joking about three per acre subdivisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8253)|
| 2:17:37| they're already applying for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8257)|
| 2:17:40| They're already applying for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8260)|
| 2:17:44| So we need these protections in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8264)|
| 2:17:48| So that's why I would urge you to support the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8268)|
| 2:17:52| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8272)|
| 2:17:56| I'll just quickly say I appreciate the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8276)|
| 2:18:00| I appreciate the substitute motion and the plan moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8280)|
| 2:18:04| I won't reiterate what I said earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8284)|
| 2:18:07| but status quo is it's not acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8287)|
| 2:18:11| I've sat here for six years and it's three units an acre sprawl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8291)|
| 2:18:15| And everybody says we don't want three units an acre sprawl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8295)|
| 2:18:19| So we undertook this and we can't end up with three units an acre sprawl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8299)|
| 2:18:23| Continued, continued, continued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8303)|
| 2:18:27| So I do want to reemphasize and I know many of you in the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8307)|
| 2:18:31| I mean, John and Martha, we we've known each other forever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8311)|
| 2:18:34| and I've participated in these meetings and advanced knocks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8314)|
| 2:18:38| and met many of you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8318)|
| 2:18:42| I really want everyone to understand that where we are that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8322)|
| 2:18:46| this plan does not force anyone to stop being a farmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8326)|
| 2:18:50| This plan does not rezone anyone's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8330)|
| 2:18:54| This plan does not automatically determine what your land will become.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8334)|
| 2:18:58| That is your right as a property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8338)|
| 2:19:01| You can be forever, whatever you want it to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8341)|
| 2:19:05| There are many, many options for land conservation and trust and other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8345)|
| 2:19:10| There is nothing that is saying you have to stop doing what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8350)|
| 2:19:14| But I hope everybody out there and Mr. Brooks, I have great respect for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8354)|
| 2:19:18| And we've had many, many conversations about this, that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8358)|
| 2:19:22| we cannot sit still in this county and hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8362)|
| 2:19:26| that things are going to figure themselves out without intentionality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8366)|
| 2:19:29| and without a plan and without a focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8369)|
| 2:19:33| Let us never, ever, ever let perfect be the enemy of good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8373)|
| 2:19:37| We've got to keep working together on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8377)|
| 2:19:41| I hope you see you have a commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8381)|
| 2:19:45| You have 11 very, very invested commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8385)|
| 2:19:49| Well, we have a lot of invested junior commissioners now, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8389)|
| 2:19:53| But all of these binders, all of these books, all of this work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8393)|
| 2:19:56| all of this work that you're putting in us, there's nobody that's not working hard on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8396)|
| 2:20:00| every single day to try to focus on it and continue to work on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8400)|
| 2:20:04| There's nobody sitting up here, you know, hoping it all figures itself out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8404)|
| 2:20:08| And so you have a good working set of ears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8408)|
| 2:20:12| I appreciate it. I'm happy to support the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8412)|
| 2:20:16| I appreciate the opportunity to keep moving things forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8416)|
| 2:20:20| Seeing no other lights, we have a substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8420)|
| 2:20:26| Made by Commissioner Beeler, seconded by Commissioner Frazier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8426)|
| 2:20:31| to approve the growth plan contingent upon approval of the comprehensive plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8431)|
| 2:20:41| and that they would both be enacted simultaneously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8441)|
| 2:20:46| All those in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8446)|
| 2:20:51| Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8451)|
| 2:20:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8453)|
| 2:20:56| Is there any other business to be brought before commission tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8456)|
| 2:21:01| Seeing none, we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240226?start=8461)|
