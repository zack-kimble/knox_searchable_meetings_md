| 0:02:41| So it's appropriate to put that off until we've had those discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=161)|

| 0:03:08| And at the end of the workshop, the law department and MPC were going to work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=188)|
| 0:03:14| So I would like to make a motion that we table 12B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=194)|
| 0:03:19| And then when we see what happens as a result of that working together, we'll know where to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=199)|

| 0:04:49| And the citation reads in part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=289)|
| 0:04:51| This facility is well maintained and upgraded continuously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=291)|
| 0:04:55| to ensure Knoxville remains competitive for meetings and conventions on a national level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=295)|
| 0:05:01| It also notes that attendees constantly come back to the hotels with great comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=301)|
| 0:05:06| about the facility, the staff, and our welcoming city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=306)|
| 0:05:10| So we really want to congratulate you and invite you, Mary, to say a few words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=310)|
| 0:05:15| Well, thank you, Mayor. It really is an honor to be recognized by our peers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=315)|
| 0:05:19| in the hotel and lodging and restaurant field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=319)|
| 0:05:23| for the work that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=323)|
| 0:05:25| And while I've got my executive team here tonight to represent the Convention Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=325)|
| 0:05:30| we're really here representing the full-time employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=330)|
| 0:05:33| There's about 40 full-time employees and about 200 who are in a part-time capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=333)|
| 0:05:38| that act as ambassadors, and this is really on their behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=338)|
| 0:05:41| They're the ones that do the hard work, that are acting as ambassadors for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=341)|

| 0:06:00| And now I'd like Russ Jensen from our 311 call center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=360)|
| 0:06:05| and I think he has some employees here, to come on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=365)|
| 0:06:09| You may have seen a press release that went out last week about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=369)|
| 0:06:13| At the National CS Week Conference in San Antonio last Tuesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=373)|
| 0:06:19| Russ's department received the 311 Synergy Group Award of Excellence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=379)|
| 0:06:24| The award recognizes one government customer service center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=384)|
| 0:06:29| that has consistently demonstrated a customer-focused approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=389)|
| 0:06:33| to improving local government service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=393)|
| 0:06:35| This is a very well-deserved award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=395)|
| 0:06:37| You all know that the 311 center answers about 200,000 calls a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=397)|
| 0:06:42| That's an average of more than 700 a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=402)|
| 0:06:45| Frankly, I don't know how they do that. It's amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=405)|
| 0:06:48| And what you might not know, that Russ has also been working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=408)|
| 0:06:51| to improve customer service throughout all city departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=411)|
| 0:06:54| He is really our leader in making sure that we are all focused on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=414)|
| 0:06:58| responding as quickly and professionally as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=418)|
| 0:07:01| to the needs of all of our constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=421)|
| 0:07:04| So he has with him Justin Bradley, a 311 employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=424)|
| 0:07:08| who is central to all of these efforts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=428)|
| 0:07:10| and Ryan Hood, who has worked as an intern with the department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=430)|
| 0:07:14| And just graduated with his master's last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=434)|
| 0:07:18| Congratulating for that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=438)|
| 0:07:22| Russ, why don't you go ahead and tell us a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=442)|
| 0:07:24| Well, we're very proud of this, and we were pleasantly surprised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=444)|
| 0:07:27| when we got the award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=447)|
| 0:07:28| It has quickly become the national standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=448)|
| 0:07:30| for government call centers and customer service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=450)|
| 0:07:33| not only throughout the U.S., but also Canada.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=453)|
| 0:07:36| And we were competing with everybody literally from Philadelphia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=456)|
| 0:07:39| to San Francisco, cities with a lot larger call centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=459)|
| 0:07:43| and a lot more resources than us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=463)|
| 0:07:45| The feedback we got from the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=465)|
| 0:07:47| who were industry experts from all over the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=467)|
| 0:07:50| not only 311 centers, but public utilities from around the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=470)|
| 0:07:54| they were incredibly impressed with the application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=474)|
| 0:07:57| and we turned in for service levels, cost efficiency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=477)|
| 0:08:01| customer outreach, community outreach, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=481)|
| 0:08:04| and overall operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=484)|
| 0:08:06| And Justin and Ryan actually did a lion's share of the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=486)|
| 0:08:09| on the response to the application that we turned in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=489)|
| 0:08:13| Ryan is a second-year student and has been an intern with us this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=493)|
| 0:08:16| at the School of Social Work here at UT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=496)|
| 0:08:18| graduated last Thursday with his master's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=498)|
| 0:08:20| and Justin has been with us for about four and a half years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=500)|
| 0:08:24| And I couldn't do what I do without these folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=504)|
| 0:08:28| the rest of the folks in the call center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=508)|
| 0:08:30| in particular someone that most of you have run into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=510)|
| 0:08:32| throughout the nine years that I've been with the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=512)|
| 0:08:34| and Shawana Tipton, who is the real brains of the operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=514)|
| 0:08:38| in that office, as most of you already know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| So I think we're very fortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=520)|
| 0:08:43| They're the right people, they do a fantastic job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=523)|
| 0:08:45| and they brought some attention back to Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=525)|
| 0:08:48| from a national standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140513?start=528)|
