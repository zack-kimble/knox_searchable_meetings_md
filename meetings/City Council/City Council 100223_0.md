| 0:00:00| Thank you all for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=0)|
| 0:00:03| We will open with the invocation by Chris Whitehall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3)|
| 0:00:06| and then Mr. Greve will lead us in the pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=6)|
| 0:00:11| Okay, if we could stand and bow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=11)|
| 0:00:14| I did want to take this moment for our invocation to honor a friend who passed away last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=14)|
| 0:00:24| Robert Lost, who was one of those wonderful citizens that was vocal and active and opinionated and fussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=24)|
| 0:00:34| and really made a lot of good things happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=34)|
| 0:00:37| So in honor of his life and his contribution to the city, I wanted to read one of his favorite poems by Wendell Berry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=37)|
| 0:00:50| It's entitled, The Peace of Wild Things, to Robert Lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=50)|
| 0:00:55| When despair for the world grows in me, and I wake in the night at the least sound,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=55)|
| 0:01:00| in fear of what my life and my children's lives may be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=60)|
| 0:01:03| I go and lie down where the wood drake rests in his beauty on the water and the great heron feeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=63)|
| 0:01:10| I come into the peace of wild things who do not tax their lives with forethought of grief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=70)|
| 0:01:16| I come into the presence of still water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=76)|
| 0:01:18| And I feel above me the day blind stars waiting with their light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=78)|
| 0:01:22| For a time I rest in the grace of the world and am free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=82)|
| 0:01:26| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=86)|
| 0:01:27| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=87)|
| 0:01:28| Let's pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=88)|
| 0:01:29| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=89)|
| 0:01:34| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=94)|

| 0:02:07| Is there a motion to approve the minutes of the February 9th meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=127)|
| 0:02:08| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=128)|
| 0:02:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=129)|
| 0:02:10| And I'll take that for a second over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=130)|
| 0:02:11| Any discussion, corrections, additions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=131)|
| 0:02:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=133)|
| 0:02:14| All in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=134)|
| 0:02:15| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=135)|
| 0:02:16| Items dealing with the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=136)|
| 0:02:17| Any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=137)|
| 0:02:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=141)|
| 0:02:22| Any items for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=142)|
| 0:02:23| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=143)|
| 0:02:24| Mr. Mayor, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=144)|
| 0:02:26| I have two that have been requested to be postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=146)|
| 0:02:30| The first one would be 10B and 11R.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=150)|
| 0:02:35| That's 10B and 11R.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=155)|
| 0:02:37| Mr. David Perkins has requested a postponement for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=157)|
| 0:02:43| His lawyer was unavailable to be here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=163)|
| 0:02:46| I've also talked with the Kingston Pike Sequoia Hills Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=166)|
| 0:02:50| and they're in agreement with this postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=170)|
| 0:02:53| I see what looks like maybe an interested party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=173)|
| 0:02:55| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=175)|
| 0:02:56| Would you like to comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=176)|
| 0:02:57| If you'd give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=177)|
| 0:02:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=179)|
| 0:03:00| John Boucher with Burroughs, Collins, and Newcomb, 900 South Gay Street, Suite 600.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=180)|
| 0:03:05| I represent Mr. Perkins, and I apologize for the late notice on requesting this continuance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=185)|
| 0:03:10| I've been in trial since Monday and will be continuing through tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=190)|
| 0:03:15| It was just recently retained and quite a bit of information to absorb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=195)|
| 0:03:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=200)|
| 0:03:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=201)|
| 0:03:22| Any questions for the council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=202)|
| 0:03:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=204)|
| 0:03:25| The motion is to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=205)|
| 0:03:26| Is that right, Mr. Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=206)|
| 0:03:27| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=207)|
| 0:03:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=208)|
| 0:03:29| Did I hear a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=209)|
| 0:03:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=210)|
| 0:03:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=211)|
| 0:03:32| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=212)|
| 0:03:33| That's for something else, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=213)|
| 0:03:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=214)|
| 0:03:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=215)|
| 0:03:36| All those in favor of postponing two weeks, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=216)|
| 0:03:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=217)|
| 0:03:38| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=218)|
| 0:03:39| The motion is taken up two weeks from now, March the 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=219)|
| 0:03:42| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=222)|
| 0:03:43| Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=223)|
| 0:03:44| Could I just take a moment to point out to all the members of council that I passed out earlier today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=224)|
| 0:03:48| copies of the home occupation provisions of your code together with the developmental standards that relate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=228)|
| 0:03:56| to home occupations so that you could take those with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=236)|
| 0:03:59| And over the next two weeks, you may want to peruse those because they will be relevant to that issue when it comes back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=239)|
| 0:04:05| Thank you, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=245)|
| 0:04:06| Any other questions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=246)|
| 0:04:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=247)|
| 0:04:08| If not, I'm going to go on to other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=248)|
| 0:04:09| And, Mr. Grieve, I think you had another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=249)|
| 0:04:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=251)|
| 0:04:12| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=252)|
| 0:04:13| The other one that we would like to postpone is 10A and 11Q.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=253)|
| 0:04:19| This is the appeals by Scenic Knoxville with the downtown review board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=259)|
| 0:04:25| I've talked to both Scenic Knoxville and have also talked to Mary Bogart with the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=265)|
| 0:04:31| She has passed out information for all of us to take a look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=271)|
| 0:04:36| One of the reasons that this postponement is being asked for is that it ties in with one of the things that I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=276)|
| 0:04:45| Vice Mayor Becker can talk about, which is the committee that's going to be formed to discuss signage in general across the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=285)|
| 0:04:55| And as it is right now, the convention center can't operate the way they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=295)|
| 0:05:02| This postponement is not affecting them as far as their present day operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=302)|
| 0:05:06| But, anyway, Scenic Knoxville has asked for a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=306)|
| 0:05:10| Vice Mayor Becker, maybe you can address some of this in terms of how long before we have a committee put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=310)|
| 0:05:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=316)|
| 0:05:17| Mr. Value, did you want to comment first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=317)|
| 0:05:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=319)|
| 0:05:20| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=320)|
| 0:05:21| I'm not in favor of postponing this right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=321)|
| 0:05:26| I'd like to have a discussion on the merits of the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=326)|
| 0:05:29| And I have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=329)|
| 0:05:31| I have a few comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=331)|
| 0:05:33| So I'm not in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=333)|
| 0:05:35| I'm not even sure where I stand on the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=335)|
| 0:05:39| But I would like to ask Mr. Swanson, if you would, could you explain to us the proper procedure process for a postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=339)|
| 0:05:48| What we, the council, should do if we think there's going to be a postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=348)|
| 0:05:54| or both parties want to postpone something prior to the meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=354)|
| 0:05:59| Because, you know, I know there's been some discussions today with the convention center folks who do a fabulous job over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=359)|
| 0:06:09| And I guess some of us have asked them to speak on behalf of what we, the city, own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=369)|
| 0:06:16| And I think this is a little odd because it's the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=376)|
| 0:06:20| It's, you know, we're running the debt over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=380)|
| 0:06:22| This is a lot more than just, you know, asking Mary if she would be in favor of a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=382)|
| 0:06:32| I don't think it's fair to do that because I think she, you know, would always,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=392)|
| 0:06:36| if I called just about anybody that works for the city up and said, would you do something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=396)|
| 0:06:41| they would probably say, yes, sir, councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=401)|
| 0:06:43| So, you know, I just don't think that we ought to discuss this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=403)|
| 0:06:48| Well, I think the answer to your question in terms of the proper process for postponement is somebody has to make a motion to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=408)|
| 0:06:58| postpone and it gets adopted by five or more votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=418)|
| 0:07:01| But I think the question that you're really asking is what about advance notice of some intent to seek a postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=421)|
| 0:07:11| And similar to what happened today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=431)|
| 0:07:14| I know that there was an e-mail that went out saying that a member of the council was their intention to seek a postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=434)|
| 0:07:22| when it comes up as a courtesy to the other council members to let you know that that was happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=442)|
| 0:07:28| or that that was at least what one member planned to do so that you would be aware of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=448)|
| 0:07:34| and so that you wouldn't do a lot of work with regard to that and have a lot of people coming and things like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=454)|
| 0:07:39| that would inconvenience people essentially when it wasn't necessary to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=459)|
| 0:07:44| And procedurally, I think it's fine to do that, to send out an e-mail saying that I intend to seek a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=464)|
| 0:07:51| When I saw it come across my computer, I got a little queasy because with the sunshine law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=471)|
| 0:07:59| you may not deliberate with regard to anything that's going to come before council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=479)|
| 0:08:03| And just sending out an e-mail that gives notice that somebody is going to seek a postponement, to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=483)|
| 0:08:10| does not constitute deliberation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=490)|
| 0:08:12| But if one of you responds to that to say, you know, I don't think postponement is a good idea for this reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=492)|
| 0:08:19| that reason, and you got into a little bit of a debate about whether postponement would be a good idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=499)|
| 0:08:24| that's absolutely deliberation on something that's supposed to come before council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=504)|
| 0:08:29| And that, in my view, would be a violation of the Open Meetings Act, and you don't want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=509)|
| 0:08:34| So just the procedural notice itself I think is okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=514)|
| 0:08:38| and probably a courtesy to the members of council to let them know that that's what you're up to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=518)|
| 0:08:44| But I would urge you all to please not get involved if and when that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=524)|
| 0:08:49| And, for example, if you're opposed to it or if, you know, there needs to be some discussion about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=529)|
| 0:08:55| please save the discussion about it for the actual meeting itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=535)|
| 0:08:59| because that would be a violation of the Open Meetings Act, in my view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=539)|
| 0:09:03| Was that what you wanted me to address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=543)|
| 0:09:05| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=545)|
| 0:09:06| And here again, I would like to bring this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=546)|
| 0:09:12| I have some questions and some discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=552)|
| 0:09:14| I think this might be, in terms of discussing whether the postponement is right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=554)|
| 0:09:18| this is probably the appropriate time if you want to discuss now whether Mr. Becker has a light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=558)|
| 0:09:22| You can go now or after Mr. Becker, either one you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=562)|
| 0:09:24| I'll hear Vice Mayor Becker first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=564)|
| 0:09:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=566)|
| 0:09:27| Let me first just follow up on what Mr. Swanson said about preliminary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=567)|
| 0:09:31| and keep in mind that even if all nine of us were to say we're going to postpone that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=571)|
| 0:09:36| it's not postponed until we vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=576)|
| 0:09:39| And, interestingly, I don't see anybody from Scenic Knoxville here, which is worrisome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=579)|
| 0:09:43| because I think somebody sat back and said, oh, this is definitely getting postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=583)|
| 0:09:47| We're not required to postpone it after somebody sends an e-mail saying I'm going to ask for this to be postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=587)|
| 0:09:53| So that's sort of a warning to people out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=593)|
| 0:09:56| Mr. Van Leeuwen, let me give you a little bit of the thinking of why the postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=596)|
| 0:10:00| and sort of the deeper thinking on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=600)|
| 0:10:04| If you recall, when we were discussing EMCs and digital billboards last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=604)|
| 0:10:12| and the year before and potentially even the year before that because it went on a very long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=612)|
| 0:10:17| we went back and forth lots of times on this, had a lot of ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=617)|
| 0:10:22| Towards the end of that, I made a suggestion that we should set up a study committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=622)|
| 0:10:27| to look at how technology can reduce sign pollution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=627)|
| 0:10:31| It was a lot of discussion about do digitals, do they look better, do they look worse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=631)|
| 0:10:37| are they distracting, all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=637)|
| 0:10:39| At the time, this council was exhausted from the discussion and I think chose to put this off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=639)|
| 0:10:44| And I think that was a wise thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=644)|
| 0:10:47| Currently, we're in some discussions with the administration about maybe picking that up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=647)|
| 0:10:51| At this moment, it is not a definite that it is going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=651)|
| 0:10:55| Before that would happen, there would be a resolution of this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=655)|
| 0:10:58| there would be a decision by the administration that we're doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=658)|
| 0:11:01| there would be a plan for who's involved in the discussion, who's not, what's going to be covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=661)|
| 0:11:06| That's not there yet, but there's movement in that direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=666)|
| 0:11:09| and there's a lot of willingness on the parts of many of the institutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=669)|
| 0:11:14| that were involved in the discussion last year to move forward on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=674)|
| 0:11:19| So I think the logic of this discussion is as a way, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=679)|
| 0:11:24| saying that some people think that there's a better solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=684)|
| 0:11:27| than arguing about each of these individual signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=687)|
| 0:11:30| We can figure out a better long-term solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=690)|
| 0:11:33| and let's take the time to see if we can do that before we argue about all these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=693)|
| 0:11:38| I would not want to put this off very long because there's not a guarantee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=698)|
| 0:11:41| that this study committee is meeting, but once it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=701)|
| 0:11:44| I think there's a sense that this can hold off until after that's had its discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=704)|
| 0:11:49| So that's kind of the logic behind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=709)|
| 0:11:51| If there are other questions, I think we can try and answer those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=711)|
| 0:11:55| I think there's some other lights and I'll come back to you in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=715)|
| 0:11:57| Council Member Grieve, do you have a comment now or do you want to wait?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=717)|
| 0:11:59| I know your light's been on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=719)|
| 0:12:00| Okay, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=720)|
| 0:12:02| I have a question for Ms. Bogart who's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=722)|
| 0:12:10| Yes, this is Germaine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=730)|
| 0:12:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=731)|
| 0:12:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=733)|
| 0:12:15| In discussion of the postponement, I know in some of the materials that were provided to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=735)|
| 0:12:19| and that we read in the minutes from previous bodies that have considered this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=739)|
| 0:12:23| you have some tenants or some contracts with large groups that want to utilize the convention center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=743)|
| 0:12:29| that are concerned about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=749)|
| 0:12:31| My question is, will the postponement jeopardize any pending contracts or business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=751)|
| 0:12:36| that you might want to execute in the next two weeks or the next 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=756)|
| 0:12:40| Did we quantify the postponement, Ms. Mitchell, the motion that's on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=760)|
| 0:12:45| The motion, I did not hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=765)|
| 0:12:47| Okay, so we've not quantified that postponement yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=767)|
| 0:12:50| So in terms of the next two weeks, the next four weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=770)|
| 0:12:53| what might that jeopardize that's on your desk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=773)|
| 0:12:56| Right now we are running our EMCs based on the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=776)|
| 0:13:01| holding up the Design Review Board's decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=781)|
| 0:13:04| So we are operating them as we were since we've opened the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=784)|
| 0:13:07| which is a six-second static hold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=787)|
| 0:13:09| As far as we're concerned, we've continued to sell the building like we have since we opened it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=789)|
| 0:13:14| Every single client that comes in the building is offered those services as part of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=794)|
| 0:13:19| So we still haven't talked about what bridge we need to cross if, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=799)|
| 0:13:22| we change how we are operating it because then we've got existing contracts that we won't be honoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=802)|
| 0:13:29| In the meantime, we're still sending out proposals, business as usual, still offering those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=809)|
| 0:13:35| So, you know, I hate to alarm any more of our clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=815)|
| 0:13:40| We had a tremendous pushback when we did go to compliance back when the ordinance was originally passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=820)|
| 0:13:46| and some of which I have to be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=826)|
| 0:13:49| You know, I made a few phone calls over here because Bonnie Browning with the quilters was the first one to push back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=829)|
| 0:13:54| We had promised that we would allow her to welcome her attendees to the city, run her spots in our EMCs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=834)|
| 0:14:00| and all of a sudden, if I do that, I'm not in compliance with the current ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=840)|
| 0:14:03| And so we did run those spots, you know, and we had to because that was part of our contract with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=843)|
| 0:14:10| We've had several clients push back since then, but then again, we went before Design Review Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=850)|
| 0:14:15| and they granted us the ability to run the signs, and that's what's being appealed here tonight is that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=855)|
| 0:14:23| So we're able to function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=863)|
| 0:14:25| You know, we're still selling it like we have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=865)|
| 0:14:30| In terms of postponement, any new contracts that come through in the next two or the next four weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=870)|
| 0:14:34| you'll go ahead and execute under the operational capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=874)|
| 0:14:38| or rules that you are using now as approved by the Design Review Board and upheld by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=878)|
| 0:14:44| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=884)|
| 0:14:46| And in your packets that I have provided you all is a PowerPoint presentation that will show you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=886)|
| 0:14:52| We're prepared here to demonstrate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=892)|
| 0:14:53| It's up to you of what our current – there's two files on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=893)|
| 0:14:59| One is how the EMC is currently running it, an example of what you would see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=899)|
| 0:15:04| The second file is how the EMC would run if it were to get a 60-second static hold with no animation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=904)|
| 0:15:10| in other words, to become compliant with the current ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=910)|
| 0:15:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=913)|
| 0:15:14| And there's some other information in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=914)|
| 0:15:16| It's a little repetitive probably, but I know we have some new council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=916)|
| 0:15:19| and I wasn't sure where they were on this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=919)|
| 0:15:22| So that's for you to take back with you if it's canceled this evening or postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=922)|
| 0:15:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=928)|
| 0:15:29| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=929)|
| 0:15:30| Do we know for sure that no one from Scenic Knoxville is here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=930)|
| 0:15:35| I don't see anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| I don't think there's – I don't see anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=938)|
| 0:15:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=942)|
| 0:15:43| Now, Councilman Greer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=943)|
| 0:15:44| What I was going to say, Mayor, is that, number one, Nick, no one from Scenic Knoxville is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=944)|
| 0:15:49| They contacted me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=949)|
| 0:15:51| Maybe being the new kid on the block made the assumption since it was their appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=951)|
| 0:15:56| and that I had talked to the convention center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=956)|
| 0:15:58| and the convention center is operating the way they are right now that this would not affect them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=958)|
| 0:16:04| So Scenic Knoxville is not present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=964)|
| 0:16:06| That's probably because of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=966)|
| 0:16:08| But I did want to just point out that they are operating now with the six seconds so that, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=968)|
| 0:16:16| I think that it would be good if we could postpone this for at least a couple of weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=976)|
| 0:16:21| so that Scenic Knoxville could be present on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=981)|
| 0:16:25| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=985)|
| 0:16:26| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=986)|
| 0:16:27| What is the basis for the postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=987)|
| 0:16:31| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=991)|
| 0:16:32| What is the basis for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=992)|
| 0:16:34| What do we hope to accomplish?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=994)|
| 0:16:36| Well, I think that one of the things –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=996)|
| 0:16:37| We still don't have a time frame for a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=997)|
| 0:16:39| I think –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=999)|
| 0:16:40| Well –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1000)|
| 0:16:41| Six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1001)|
| 0:16:42| Is that what you said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1002)|
| 0:16:43| Six weeks would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1003)|
| 0:16:44| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1004)|
| 0:16:45| I didn't mean to put words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1005)|
| 0:16:46| I thought that – I heard you say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1006)|
| 0:16:47| Two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1007)|
| 0:16:48| Two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1008)|
| 0:16:49| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1009)|
| 0:16:50| Two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1010)|
| 0:16:51| Let Scenic Knoxville be here on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1011)|
| 0:16:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1012)|
| 0:16:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1014)|
| 0:16:55| We're concerned about Scenic Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1015)|
| 0:16:56| And I can't really speak for Scenic Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1016)|
| 0:16:57| I'm no longer on their board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| But part of the concern that they have is the fact that it is a city run sign that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1018)|
| 0:17:03| not in compliance with the other signs in the city, which is one thing that we had hoped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1023)|
| 0:17:07| that this new group would discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1027)|
| 0:17:11| They're also concerned about the amount of time, whether or not there might be a compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1031)|
| 0:17:15| from six seconds to, say, ten seconds or twelve seconds or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1035)|
| 0:17:20| They're concerned about the safety issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1040)|
| 0:17:22| The same sorts of things that we've really been discussing for the last year over signage in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1042)|
| 0:17:27| whether it's EMCs, digital billboards, or signage in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1047)|
| 0:17:31| So that's a concern that I think that Scenic Knoxville has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1051)|
| 0:17:35| But, again, I would ask council to at least consider the postponement for at least two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1055)|
| 0:17:41| to allow Scenic Knoxville to be here to discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1061)|
| 0:17:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1067)|
| 0:17:48| And that's all I have for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1068)|
| 0:17:53| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1073)|
| 0:17:54| I'd actually like to suggest a four-week postponement if Mr. Greaves is open for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1074)|
| 0:17:59| And I think partly there are two ways that this can go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1079)|
| 0:18:03| We can at some point consider this appeal, in which case we get a decision as of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1083)|
| 0:18:09| nine o'clock some Tuesday night of what the sign should be operating the next day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1089)|
| 0:18:13| And I think that will cause problems, could cause problems for the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1093)|
| 0:18:18| The other outcome is this task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1098)|
| 0:18:20| And this is the higher level solution that we get sort of a concept that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1100)|
| 0:18:29| here's how we want the city to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1109)|
| 0:18:31| Here's how things should look that we're talking about implementing over a longer period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1111)|
| 0:18:36| We're talking about a bigger solution that would be easier to implement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1116)|
| 0:18:41| So I'd be inclined to postpone it for four weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| because I think at that point we'll know whether this task force is going to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1124)|
| 0:18:48| And if it is, I think it's fairness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| The convention center is operating fine now that we could put this off and see if there is a happy outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1130)|
| 0:18:56| I don't know that there will be, but there might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| And I'm always very optimistic about good outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1138)|
| 0:19:01| So I'd like to suggest four weeks as opposed to two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1141)|
| 0:19:06| I'll change the amendment to four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| That would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1148)|
| 0:19:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1149)|
| 0:19:10| Right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1150)|
| 0:19:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1151)|
| 0:19:12| I don't see any other light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1152)|
| 0:19:13| Right now there's not a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1153)|
| 0:19:14| The motion now on the floor is for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1154)|
| 0:19:16| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1156)|
| 0:19:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1157)|
| 0:19:18| Further discussion then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1158)|
| 0:19:20| Well, I've got a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1160)|
| 0:19:21| I just, you know, I don't know how many years, Mr. Donaldson, can you enlighten me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1161)|
| 0:19:26| how many years we've been arguing about this subject?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1166)|
| 0:19:29| I mean, it's been going on forever and ever and ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1169)|
| 0:19:33| I mean, I don't know what four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1173)|
| 0:19:37| But we're going to form a committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1177)|
| 0:19:39| and they're going to meet and solve it in four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1179)|
| 0:19:44| Mr. Donaldson, do you know the answer to the question, I guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1184)|
| 0:19:49| I think I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1189)|
| 0:19:50| The first regulations regarding EMCs occurred early in 2004 or late in 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1190)|
| 0:19:58| They were amended about six or eight months ago after a good year of discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1198)|
| 0:20:04| starting with billboards and ending with electronic message centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1204)|
| 0:20:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1208)|
| 0:20:09| So, I guess my follow-up question is what we're going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1209)|
| 0:20:13| what's going to happen in that four-week period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1213)|
| 0:20:15| What's going to change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1215)|
| 0:20:18| Mr. Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1218)|
| 0:20:20| I think that, Mr. Kravlis, that the committee is not going to solve it in four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1220)|
| 0:20:25| What we'll know in four weeks is whether there is a committee that is even going to consider solving it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1225)|
| 0:20:30| And we don't right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1230)|
| 0:20:32| Typically, we come back and say, nope, we're not going to do this thing, in which case we hear the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1232)|
| 0:20:38| We could come back and say we're doing this, but it's not considering anything related to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1238)|
| 0:20:43| And I think if we come back and we say there is a committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1243)|
| 0:20:46| then the body here can make the decision about, no, we want to decide this now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1246)|
| 0:20:52| Again, I don't know that we're going to get a solution, but I think there's a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1252)|
| 0:20:55| And after arguing for practically since the time I was elected about this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1255)|
| 0:21:00| I would love to make it go away for the next six or seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1260)|
| 0:21:04| Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1264)|
| 0:21:05| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1265)|
| 0:21:06| That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1266)|
| 0:21:07| For the last four, almost for 14 straight months, we were a signed committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1267)|
| 0:21:13| The city council acted in that role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1273)|
| 0:21:16| And since we've made that decision, I guess, Ms. Cash,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1276)|
| 0:21:20| could you explain the process where this has gone since we acted on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1280)|
| 0:21:26| I know it's gone through the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| It's gone through the design review board, which this council put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1288)|
| 0:21:34| And, you know, I think we have an obligation to support their decision since we put them in the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1294)|
| 0:21:39| And, Ms. Cash?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1299)|
| 0:21:42| It's my understanding that per the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1302)|
| 0:21:45| their first appeal for approval or their first request for approval was to the D1 design review board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1305)|
| 0:21:51| And they were approved by that board to operate the sign in compliance with the approval from D1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1311)|
| 0:21:58| That decision of D1 was appealed to the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1318)|
| 0:22:03| The Planning Commission upheld the D1 approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1323)|
| 0:22:07| And now the MPC approval has been appealed to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1327)|
| 0:22:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1335)|
| 0:22:16| Mayor, I guess I'll direct this question to Dr. Lyons, who I called today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1336)|
| 0:22:20| What is the administration's position on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1340)|
| 0:22:24| Well, if you'll bear with me a second, it's a little complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1344)|
| 0:22:27| We don't think the appeal, frankly, has merit on its face because it's about safety rather than aesthetics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1347)|
| 0:22:34| and we don't think there's any data to support a safety concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1354)|
| 0:22:39| That having been said, we understand the request for the postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1359)|
| 0:22:43| and we've discussed the upcoming task force as a device that we want to be able to cooperate with and be a part of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1363)|
| 0:22:52| Our position has been on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1372)|
| 0:22:57| We would just as soon have this appeal denied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1377)|
| 0:23:02| and have the convention center have some certainty to go ahead with the business because it's critical for the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1382)|
| 0:23:06| But we're getting into an argument on the merits of it rather than the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1386)|
| 0:23:11| So I'd rather not say much more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1391)|
| 0:23:13| Obviously, there's no direct, as Ms. Bogert pointed out, we can operate as we are, as we continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1393)|
| 0:23:18| And especially now that Scenic Knoxville's not here, I think in the spirit of fair play, we certainly don't want to necessarily force it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1398)|
| 0:23:26| But our position has been that this is not about the existence of the sign, which is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1406)|
| 0:23:32| This is about the operational standards, which the design review board had under its purview to review and did review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1412)|
| 0:23:39| And so we think it's a little different than many of the other things that might appear before the task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1419)|
| 0:23:44| but people could disagree on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1424)|
| 0:23:47| Mr. Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1427)|
| 0:23:48| Are you through, Mr. Payne?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1428)|
| 0:23:50| Well, I'll just say this, that I've always tried to support postponements and dialogue and discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1430)|
| 0:23:56| and our council's been known for that for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1436)|
| 0:23:59| I just, you know, I ask what the basis is for the postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1439)|
| 0:24:04| and I think Dr. Lyons just said it's the only thing I've ever heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1444)|
| 0:24:07| You know, this is a safety issue the whole time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1447)|
| 0:24:11| And I don't buy that, and we've discussed it over and over and over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1451)|
| 0:24:15| But having said that, after two or four weeks, we have it come back up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1455)|
| 0:24:20| and then we're going to have a review panel put together, which is going to prolong it forever and ever and ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1460)|
| 0:24:26| It just goes on and on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1466)|
| 0:24:28| And I think we owe it, especially in this environment, this economy we're in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1468)|
| 0:24:33| to allow our convention center for them to focus on their core business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1473)|
| 0:24:39| And I know we're tying up other city resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| trying to look at the statistics on accidents at Henley and on Cumberland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1482)|
| 0:24:48| It's just never-ending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| And I'm not going to – I mean, I don't know if I'll support this or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1490)|
| 0:24:53| unless I hear what we're going to accomplish in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1493)|
| 0:24:56| I don't think I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1498)|
| 0:25:00| Well, I mean, in two weeks we can have it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1500)|
| 0:25:05| I wouldn't feel comfortable not having seen it here to be able to say their piece about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1505)|
| 0:25:13| But I don't think it's necessary to carry this on for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1513)|
| 0:25:18| You know, I don't see another committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1518)|
| 0:25:20| I just don't think it's going to be settled in that amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1520)|
| 0:25:24| And if it isn't, if it's going to go back into discussion, it freezes her salespeople.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1524)|
| 0:25:28| They can't talk in good business faith that they're going to be able to promise something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1528)|
| 0:25:34| And, you know, I've been in sales all my life, and your word is your bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1534)|
| 0:25:38| That's the only thing you've got to sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| I mean, they've got a great facility to sell, but if they don't trust the salespeople, then it's dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1540)|
| 0:25:46| So I think the motion is for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1546)|
| 0:25:49| I'd like to enter a substitute motion for a two-week postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1549)|
| 0:25:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1554)|
| 0:25:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1555)|
| 0:25:56| There's a substitute motion for two weeks now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| That now is the item that we're dealing now with the substitute motion for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1558)|
| 0:26:04| So we'll need to vote, make sure I'm right, to vote to substitute two weeks for four weeks at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1564)|
| 0:26:09| So the discussion right now needs to be about two weeks versus four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1569)|
| 0:26:12| If you'll just leave your lights on, but raise your hand if you want to talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1572)|
| 0:26:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1577)|
| 0:26:23| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1583)|
| 0:26:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1584)|
| 0:26:25| Just did everybody hear Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1585)|
| 0:26:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1587)|
| 0:26:28| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1588)|
| 0:26:29| I think at this point we're down to fundamental fairness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1589)|
| 0:26:32| I mean, the council person that was talking to them told them that he had talked to both sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1592)|
| 0:26:37| and they're not here to represent their position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1597)|
| 0:26:40| It is their appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| I don't know what two weeks is going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1602)|
| 0:26:43| but I certainly think fundamental fairness and their reliance on maybe a misassurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1603)|
| 0:26:49| but that they would have a chance to speak to the motion argues that we should give them the two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1609)|
| 0:26:54| I don't think it's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1614)|
| 0:26:56| I think it's wrong to cut them off, and I don't like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1616)|
| 0:27:00| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| I'm going to make a plea for four weeks, and I want to go to what Mr. Pavlis said about certainty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1621)|
| 0:27:07| Six years ago, we set up a study committee that established operational patterns for EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1627)|
| 0:27:14| It was, I think, an eight-second hold time and exempted city-owned signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| and there was certainty that they could do what they could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1637)|
| 0:27:20| And then we came along later and changed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| And I would argue for a four-week postponement because I think in four weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1642)|
| 0:27:26| we know whether we're going to have a committee that is considering whether we're going to change this or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1646)|
| 0:27:31| And I understand your uncertainty on that, Mr. Pavlis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1651)|
| 0:27:34| but we can always change the rules on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1654)|
| 0:27:37| and I don't want to decide something one week and then come around two weeks later and say, oh, and by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1657)|
| 0:27:42| we're considering reversing the decision we made two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1662)|
| 0:27:45| So I think four weeks makes more sense than two, but that's just my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1665)|
| 0:27:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1670)|
| 0:27:51| The motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1671)|
| 0:27:52| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1672)|
| 0:27:53| Motion on the floor is two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1673)|
| 0:27:54| As Mr. Schwantz said, if you vote for this, it's postponed for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1674)|
| 0:28:01| So explain that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1683)|
| 0:28:04| If you're for four weeks, you vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| If you're for two weeks, you vote yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| Or if you're for something else, you vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1688)|
| 0:28:11| But what happens if we vote no on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| Well, then somebody could then bring up four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1693)|
| 0:28:15| We'll have to have another motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1695)|
| 0:28:16| Then you can bring up four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1698)|
| 0:28:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| Everybody ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1700)|
| 0:28:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1701)|
| 0:28:22| All those in favor of postponing for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1702)|
| 0:28:24| Yeah, just real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1704)|
| 0:28:25| If you vote aye here, that means you're in favor of a two-week postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1705)|
| 0:28:30| If you vote no, you could be you're not in favor of postponing at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1710)|
| 0:28:33| or you're in favor of postponing four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1713)|
| 0:28:35| If you're in favor of postponing four weeks, you can vote no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1715)|
| 0:28:37| and then rebring a new motion to postpone for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1717)|
| 0:28:40| All I wanted was a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1720)|
| 0:28:45| You did a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1725)|
| 0:28:48| I did a great job answering the question you didn't ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1728)|
| 0:28:51| Ms. Mitchell, could you do a roll call, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1731)|

| 0:29:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1770)|
| 0:29:31| Well, actually, we're still on items for postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| Only now if you have an item to be postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1773)|
| 0:29:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1775)|
| 0:29:36| We'll go to the others in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1776)|
| 0:29:38| Vice Mayor Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1778)|
| 0:29:39| I would like to postpone eight a for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1779)|
| 0:29:42| This is the resolution reappointing Joe Holquist as co-chair of the Transportation and Mobility Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1782)|
| 0:29:50| As part of our boards and commission discussion, we are working on a solution to this that we don't have yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1790)|
| 0:29:55| And I think by the end of dinner next time we will have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1795)|
| 0:29:58| So I'd like to postpone this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1798)|
| 0:30:00| And I'd like to apologize to Mr. Holquist for not calling about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1800)|
| 0:30:03| It's my fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1803)|
| 0:30:04| But I hope you just enjoyed that last discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1804)|
| 0:30:07| Made you miss it for old time's sake, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1807)|

| 0:30:29| Well, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1829)|
| 0:30:30| This is I suppose in the form of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| I move that we consolidate the discussion and voting on items 9D, E, and F since they're about one property and one subject matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1833)|
| 0:30:43| And that we also consolidate items 9G, H, and I because they're about one property and one subject matter so that we move along and discuss them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1843)|
| 0:30:51| I love consolidation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1851)|

| 0:31:06| It's been moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=1866)|

| 0:34:59| First, they're all related to council business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2099)|
| 0:35:02| First, I want to apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2102)|
| 0:35:03| My e-mail has been down for a couple days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2103)|
| 0:35:05| so I don't actually have finals on some of these because you might have e-mailed me with something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2105)|
| 0:35:09| that I haven't seen yet, and I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| We currently have three requests for workshops for people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| and I'm going to ask Ms. Mitchell to get out to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2115)|
| 0:35:19| The Chamber Partnership has asked for a workshop sort of explaining what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2119)|
| 0:35:23| The Pension Board has asked for one like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2123)|
| 0:35:26| Again, want to get out and see if people want to do this and scheduling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2126)|
| 0:35:30| I also want to suggest on my own that at our next meeting we're taking up the East County Sector Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2130)|
| 0:35:36| which has been controversial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| My understanding is just getting through MPC took this two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2138)|
| 0:35:41| I'd like to suggest we do a workshop on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2141)|
| 0:35:44| Again, we'll get an e-mail out to folks on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2144)|

| 0:35:55| I want to get back reports from boards and commissions that people are serving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2155)|
| 0:36:01| I want to talk a little bit about agenda review, and I want to talk about a scheduling on workshops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2161)|
| 0:36:08| and I want to apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2168)|
| 0:36:09| We've had some concern about why are workshops not on the regular workshop night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2169)|

| 0:36:19| so we have not been scheduling things necessarily on the normal workshop night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2179)|
| 0:36:24| which is on a separate week from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| I've been trying to free up time to be away for a week, and I'd like to talk more about is there an ability we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2186)|
| 0:36:33| to schedule a regular workshop on the same week as city council, and there's some pluses and minuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2193)|
| 0:36:39| I want to pick that up at dinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2199)|
| 0:36:44| We have, I think, finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2204)|
| 0:36:46| Well, we are not quite finished with the appointments to boards and commissions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2206)|
| 0:36:51| because I haven't been able to see my in-laws for a couple days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2211)|
| 0:36:54| When I get my e-mail back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2214)|
| 0:36:55| They have to approve it or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2215)|

| 0:37:02| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2222)|
| 0:37:03| What did I say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2223)|
| 0:37:04| You haven't seen your in-laws, so you can't finish approving the boards and commissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2224)|
| 0:37:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2228)|

| 0:41:49| Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2509)|
| 0:41:50| If I might, Mr. Mayor, could I ask either someone from Habitat or perhaps from MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2510)|
| 0:41:56| is there any effort to try to make the fronts of these houses conform a little more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2516)|
| 0:42:04| to the design of houses in the neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2524)|
| 0:42:07| You know, we are doing a wonderful thing by providing houses to people that don't have them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2527)|
| 0:42:12| but over time we are changing the character of neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2532)|
| 0:42:16| and it would be nice if you could, you know, model the fronts a little bit more like the existing housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2536)|
| 0:42:23| so they fit in and blend in and don't distract from the neighborhood integrity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2543)|
| 0:42:29| If you could give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2549)|
| 0:42:31| My name is Mark Seinley with Batson Himes, Norvell & Poe, 4334 Paper Mill Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2551)|
| 0:42:35| Knoxville, Tennessee, 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2555)|
| 0:42:40| In regards to that question, I'd have to talk with Habitat Humanity officials themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2560)|
| 0:42:47| to get with them to see if they could conform to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2567)|
| 0:42:52| I assume that they would be willing to work with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2572)|
| 0:42:56| The reason I say that is in walking around and talking to community members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2576)|
| 0:43:00| you find a certain amount of reaction that now there are five houses in our neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2580)|
| 0:43:07| that don't look like they fit in, and we're not trying to build Taj Mahals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2587)|
| 0:43:11| but there are some architectural features like maybe they all have front porches in that neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2591)|
| 0:43:17| or some shape to the roof line that conforms a little closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2597)|
| 0:43:22| I recognize Ms. Rojera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2602)|
| 0:43:24| Ms. Rojera, perhaps she could help us with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2606)|
| 0:43:27| Actually, I'm going to have Anita respond because she's on the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| but Habitat has had to respond to the infill housing IH1 overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2609)|
| 0:43:35| and Ms. Cash could explain more about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2615)|
| 0:43:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2619)|
| 0:43:40| Most of the areas in town are in Vice Mayor Becker's district that have the IH overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2620)|
| 0:43:46| and they are required to submit to that committee for review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2626)|
| 0:43:50| and that is one of the characteristics that we do look at during review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2630)|
| 0:43:55| In fact, that meeting is tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2635)|
| 0:43:58| We look at where the house is proposed on the lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2638)|
| 0:44:03| and each specific area of town that has the IH overlay has its own set of development standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2643)|
| 0:44:10| The reason they're not required to do that with this specific one is this property is not in the IH overlay district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2650)|
| 0:44:17| does not have that overlay on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| And also in Ms. Rojera's office, anything that they fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2659)|
| 0:44:24| we also have a committee that looks at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2664)|
| 0:44:27| and makes them comply with those infill housing requirements as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2667)|
| 0:44:33| So I think the point is that Habitat has adjusted their designs based on the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2673)|
| 0:44:38| so perhaps this gentleman could take that back to Habitat for this location as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2678)|
| 0:44:45| If they lack the overlay status, is there no attempt to conform at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2685)|
| 0:44:50| I don't believe there's any regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2690)|
| 0:44:52| There's no requirement, but is there some effort?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2692)|
| 0:44:55| Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2695)|
| 0:44:56| Or maybe he can check with Habitat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2696)|
| 0:44:57| He would have to check with Habitat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2697)|
| 0:44:58| That would be a nice thing because I think you don't want to introduce neighbors into a neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2698)|
| 0:45:02| and have some resentment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| I think we're trying to incorporate these people into neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| and making them a viable part of a healthy neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2706)|
| 0:45:09| So I would appreciate you doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2713)|
| 0:45:14| I just wanted to thank Mr. Dellavopi for his comments because they're right on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2714)|
| 0:45:20| I have a lot of complaints from people in the 6th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2720)|
| 0:45:26| concerning the type of housing for Habitat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2726)|
| 0:45:30| People understand the concept of Habitat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2730)|
| 0:45:34| and trying to help people to have a home ordinarily would not get one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2734)|
| 0:45:39| But in many instances, these houses do not conform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2739)|
| 0:45:44| I know in my own neighborhood I can bear witness to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2744)|
| 0:45:48| and your home is your best investment that you have for most people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2748)|
| 0:45:53| So I'm urging Habitat to certainly consider what they're building and where and how.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2753)|
| 0:46:01| I know they have cost constraints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| and you're doing good just to build a house on someone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2764)|
| 0:46:07| but be a little more sensitive in certain neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2767)|
| 0:46:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2774)|
| 0:46:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2775)|

| 0:46:57| Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| Yes, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2819)|
| 0:47:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2820)|
| 0:47:01| Just a couple, and I know I've addressed this with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2821)|
| 0:47:05| and I don't want to belabor it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2825)|
| 0:47:06| but I would ask the city executive department to look at these buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2826)|
| 0:47:14| as we bring downtown Knoxville back into a healthy condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2834)|
| 0:47:18| and we get them rehabbed and we get them in active use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2838)|
| 0:47:21| and support of our downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| if we're not better off at some point selling the property to a private entity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2843)|
| 0:47:29| that would manage lease, rent, keep up with the structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2849)|
| 0:47:33| This one may be a special case because it's attached to the theater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2853)|
| 0:47:37| and we're very much tied into that theater complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2857)|
| 0:47:40| But I guess at some point when we go from abandoned empty buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2860)|
| 0:47:45| to a viable kind of downtown space that's being used for retail use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2865)|
| 0:47:51| I don't see a whole big reason for government to be the manager and leasing agent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2871)|
| 0:47:56| So if we could just look at that question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| and find out if they're in a better way to recapture that money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2878)|
| 0:48:02| and put it to use in city government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| Yes, and I'll comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2884)|
| 0:48:05| It's a fair point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2885)|
| 0:48:06| As we talked about earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2886)|
| 0:48:07| obviously we always want to make certain we're getting the best return for taxpayers we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2887)|
| 0:48:11| A couple of comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2891)|
| 0:48:12| We've done that in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2892)|
| 0:48:13| I mean, prior council, we sold some buildings that the city owned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2893)|
| 0:48:16| because we didn't think the city needed to own them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2896)|
| 0:48:19| In this case, it is a little unique in that it's a shared structure with the movie theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2899)|
| 0:48:23| We did have an interest in making certain what went in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2903)|
| 0:48:26| So it's a little different case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2906)|
| 0:48:27| And now that we have something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2907)|
| 0:48:29| could we monetize that lease by selling it to somebody who would, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2909)|
| 0:48:33| discount the cash flow and pay us according dollars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2913)|
| 0:48:35| I think we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2915)|
| 0:48:36| In today's low interest rates, I think we still feel like we're probably better off in the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2916)|
| 0:48:41| But your question is a fair one, one of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2921)|
| 0:48:43| No matter what we own, we need to always be reviewing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2923)|
| 0:48:46| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2926)|
| 0:48:47| Anybody else want to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2927)|

| 0:49:17| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2957)|
| 0:49:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2958)|
| 0:49:19| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2959)|
| 0:49:20| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2960)|
| 0:49:21| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2961)|
| 0:49:22| I think in reading this packet, which was impressive in its size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2962)|
| 0:49:26| we are basically getting a contract manager to help us better run our 457B Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2966)|
| 0:49:34| Is that the thrust of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2974)|
| 0:49:37| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2977)|
| 0:49:39| That's a fair way, I guess, to describe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2979)|
| 0:49:41| We had Nationwide as the administrator of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2981)|
| 0:49:47| Now Prudential will be the administrator of the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2987)|
| 0:49:52| and we will have Morgan Keegan as the financial advisor to the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2992)|
| 0:49:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2997)|
| 0:49:58| And holding money of employees, we're acting as a fiduciary, I guess, so we want the best help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=2998)|
| 0:50:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3002)|
| 0:50:03| We're not subject to ERISA, but it sets the standard for us in regard to fiduciary responsibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3003)|
| 0:50:11| and that's what we're trying to follow is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3011)|
| 0:50:14| and that's why we went through the process we did in the selection of the administrator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3014)|
| 0:50:20| as well as the importance of having the financial advisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3020)|
| 0:50:23| And then the Deferred Comp Committee, made up of employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3023)|
| 0:50:29| who will be the body which will serve as oversight to the plan itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3029)|
| 0:50:35| and they will have as their resource Morgan Keegan as the financial advisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3035)|
| 0:50:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3041)|
| 0:50:42| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3042)|
| 0:50:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3043)|
| 0:50:44| Ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3044)|
| 0:50:45| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3045)|
| 0:50:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3046)|
| 0:50:47| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3047)|
| 0:50:48| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3048)|
| 0:50:49| I move, authorizing the mayor to approve change order number three to contract number C070137| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3049)|
| 0:50:54| between the City of Knoxville and Vaughan and Melton Inc. for the Gay Street Streetscapes project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3054)|
| 0:50:59| for various design changes due to unanticipated conditions encountered during the project construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3059)|
| 0:51:04| We will increase the contract price by $36,640 for a new contract price of $432,480.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3064)|
| 0:51:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3074)|
| 0:51:15| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3075)|
| 0:51:18| Can you give a little insight into what these changes really were?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3078)|
| 0:51:23| Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3083)|
| 0:51:24| Talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3084)|
| 0:51:28| I think there's an attachment I would refer to on the change order where we talk about details on the sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3088)|
| 0:51:40| the joining pattern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3100)|
| 0:51:43| One of the issues on the west side of Gay Street, there was an area under the sidewalk where we didn't have access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3103)|
| 0:51:53| where it was difficult to tell where the street side of the existing retaining wall was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3113)|
| 0:51:59| And when we got in, got all that uncovered, we had to modify the design for the structural slab somewhat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3119)|
| 0:52:06| That's in item number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3126)|
| 0:52:08| In item two, there was a pile cap design that had to be modified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3128)|
| 0:52:15| And the third item was the design of the micro piles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3135)|
| 0:52:20| which I think was a construction change order that we talked about late in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3140)|
| 0:52:30| And the last item is an estimate for miscellaneous things that we have not anticipated at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3150)|
| 0:52:38| but we want to have funding as things come up in the field that we can react to if we find additional things that we don't expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3158)|
| 0:52:47| So is that a cost plus, I mean, not to exceed the $24,000 on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3167)|
| 0:52:51| All of this is a not to exceed cost that's billed as we ask for the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3171)|
| 0:52:58| It's, in other words, this won't be paid to Vaughn and Melton in the amount that we're asking for a change order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3178)|
| 0:53:05| This is a top limit that we're asking for authority to ask for the consultant to do the work, which will then be billed to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3185)|
| 0:53:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3194)|
| 0:53:15| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3195)|
| 0:53:16| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3196)|
| 0:53:17| I did attend a meeting of the streetscapes on last Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3197)|
| 0:53:23| And the blogs that Emmett has been sitting are good, and I'm anticipating they're coming along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3203)|
| 0:53:31| They're running to a few things that they did not anticipate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3211)|
| 0:53:35| But overall, it's a good program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3215)|
| 0:53:37| It's going to be something that the city is going to be proud of when they're finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3217)|
| 0:53:41| I think they're looking at August somewhere in there as a completion date for everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3221)|
| 0:53:45| But I did attend that meeting, and it was very informational on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3225)|
| 0:53:51| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3231)|
| 0:53:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3232)|
| 0:53:53| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3233)|
| 0:53:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3234)|
| 0:53:55| All those ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3235)|
| 0:53:56| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3236)|
| 0:53:57| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3237)|
| 0:53:58| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3238)|
| 0:53:59| 11F is a resolution authorizing the mayor to enter into a contract with Knoxville Recycling Coalition for collection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3239)|
| 0:54:04| hauling, and recycling of cardboard generated by businesses within the Central Business Improvement District in an amount not to exceed $19,500 per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3244)|
| 0:54:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3256)|
| 0:54:17| I just have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3257)|
| 0:54:18| Looking at 11F and 11G, it appeared to me that we had a downtown recycling station that someone is manning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3258)|
| 0:54:29| I'm trying to remember which street that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3269)|
| 0:54:31| I think Goodwill has one of the six places on State Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3271)|
| 0:54:34| There's a drop-off center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3274)|
| 0:54:35| And I didn't know whether we were duplicating services or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3275)|
| 0:54:39| I don't see Mr. Brace here, and he's probably...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3279)|
| 0:54:42| I think Mr. King can take that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3282)|
| 0:54:44| I'm wondering what this adds to that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3284)|
| 0:54:48| Particularly some of the new council may not realize that in the downtown area, the city operates our own garbage truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3288)|
| 0:54:56| When we bid that work, because of the frequency that we need to pick up garbage downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3296)|
| 0:55:04| it was in our best benefit to purchase a compactor and pick up the trash ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3304)|
| 0:55:12| The stuff that used to be on the sidewalk in bags, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3312)|
| 0:55:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3315)|
| 0:55:16| But in addition to that, we initially had a divided compactor where we picked up cardboard and trash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3316)|
| 0:55:25| That compactor didn't work out very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3325)|
| 0:55:29| It was too many moving parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3329)|
| 0:55:30| It failed a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3330)|
| 0:55:31| So we entertained an option to have a contractor pick up the cardboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3331)|
| 0:55:39| And that's a service that we provide to downtown businesses because of the volume of cardboard that's there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3339)|
| 0:55:48| that needs to be picked up and recycled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3348)|
| 0:55:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3353)|
| 0:55:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3354)|
| 0:55:55| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3355)|
| 0:55:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3356)|
| 0:55:57| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3357)|
| 0:55:58| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3358)|
| 0:55:59| 11G is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Goodwill Industries Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3359)|
| 0:56:04| recycling super centers at nine area locations throughout the city for an annual contract price not to exceed $151,740.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3364)|
| 0:56:13| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3373)|
| 0:56:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3374)|
| 0:56:15| Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3375)|
| 0:56:17| Yes, Mr. King, if I could ask him, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3377)|
| 0:56:21| I see that there's language in here saying that we have some flexibility if we decide to go to curbside recycling in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3381)|
| 0:56:31| so we won't be bound to sort of a long-term relationship that might not be needed on some sites at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3391)|
| 0:56:38| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3398)|
| 0:56:39| So we're keeping in place the nine centers we have, but if we do something else, we won't be double paying for that recycling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3399)|
| 0:56:48| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3408)|
| 0:56:49| Mr. Brace has made, in coordination with the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3409)|
| 0:56:52| has made an attempt to include the option that we had a workshop on that if all that works out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3412)|
| 0:56:59| and we end up with a single stream recycling program that we can modify this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3419)|
| 0:57:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3424)|
| 0:57:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3425)|
| 0:57:06| Councilman Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3426)|
| 0:57:07| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3427)|
| 0:57:08| Actually, this refers to 11F, but it does have to do with recycling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3428)|
| 0:57:12| Mr. King, when was the last time that maybe we notified the businesses downtown about the recycling, especially the cardboard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3432)|
| 0:57:20| Is there going to be some kind of notice to go out to let some of the new businesses know that this is happening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3440)|
| 0:57:27| I'm not sure when we have made that notification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3447)|
| 0:57:30| It's pretty well utilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| And if you know of some businesses that may not know, I'll be happy to get with you after the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3452)|
| 0:57:37| and be happy to make sure they know about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3457)|
| 0:57:39| I know we have a number of new businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3459)|
| 0:57:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3461)|
| 0:57:42| We'd be glad to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3462)|
| 0:57:44| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3466)|
| 0:57:47| Mr. King, just curious about the drop-off centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3467)|
| 0:57:50| How often are they picked up, the centers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3470)|
| 0:57:55| Well, they're picked up when we're notified that they need to be picked up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3475)|
| 0:58:00| You know, in some locations are busier than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3480)|
| 0:58:05| The one out off Cross Park is one of our heaviest used convenience centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3485)|
| 0:58:11| and I'm sure we would need to empty those containers much more frequently than we would another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3491)|
| 0:58:20| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3500)|
| 0:58:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3502)|
| 0:58:23| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3503)|

| 0:58:26| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3506)|
| 0:58:27| 11H is a resolution authorizing the acquisition, by condemnation if necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3507)|
| 0:58:31| of a fee simple interest in certain property located at 2909 Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3511)|
| 0:58:36| believed to be owned by Alfred E. Grady at a cost not to exceed $15,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3516)|
| 0:58:40| as recommended by the Chronic Problem Properties Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3520)|

| 1:05:21| of the State of Tennessee, requested by Councilmember Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3921)|
| 1:05:27| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3927)|
| 1:05:28| Thank you, Ms. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3928)|
| 1:05:29| This was something for the new members, came up last fall, Mr. Holquist suggested it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3929)|
| 1:05:35| We postponed because this is an interesting idea for Council to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3935)|
| 1:05:39| The idea, as Ms. Mitchell read, would be moving the Vice Mayor and chairing the meetings as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3939)|
| 1:05:47| opposed to the Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3947)|
| 1:05:49| I think we decided it's worth y'all thinking and frankly, my question would be, is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3949)|
| 1:05:55| anybody here who would like to discuss this because if there is, I think there could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3955)|
| 1:05:58| some longer discussions happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3958)|
| 1:06:01| If not, I know Mr. Holquist is not expecting this to pass and it would move quickly on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3961)|
| 1:06:09| I see some lights, Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3969)|
| 1:06:13| Can you give us a little history on this besides just, I mean, was that just his idea or has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3973)|
| 1:06:17| this been researched, looked into or other governments run this way or tell us a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3977)|
| 1:06:22| bit of background?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3982)|
| 1:06:24| Actually, most city governments do not have, most municipal governments and frankly, most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3984)|
| 1:06:30| counties don't have the Chief Administrative Officer as the chair of the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3990)|
| 1:06:37| Very few do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3997)|
| 1:06:38| Congress doesn't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3998)|
| 1:06:39| County Commission doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=3999)|
| 1:06:40| State legislature, that's not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4000)|
| 1:06:44| Mr. Holquist had always been somebody who thought that was something to consider because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4004)|
| 1:06:47| it works in so many other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4007)|
| 1:06:50| I think the argument, the counter argument is our system seems to work quite well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4010)|
| 1:06:55| I think it's something of if there's interest in asking some of those questions and talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4015)|
| 1:07:00| about it, we can continue the discussion by a workshop or something like that, but I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4020)|
| 1:07:08| know that there's that much interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4028)|
| 1:07:10| What does the mayor do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4030)|
| 1:07:13| Well, I'll ask, I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4033)|
| 1:07:16| What do you do, Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4036)|
| 1:07:19| Well, that's actually a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4039)|
| 1:07:20| In cities where the, and Bob's right, it's actually more common that the mayor not chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4040)|
| 1:07:26| but in cities where they don't, I've talked to other mayors, a lot of them don't even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4046)|
| 1:07:29| come to council, quite frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4049)|
| 1:07:31| They just, you know, council meets and if they need something, they send somebody or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4051)|
| 1:07:35| they go if requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4055)|
| 1:07:37| So, the mayor is there if requests are needed or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4057)|
| 1:07:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4062)|
| 1:07:43| Councilman Dela Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4063)|
| 1:07:45| I just wanted to thank the mayor for the great job he does of moving us along and getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4065)|
| 1:07:51| his staff ready to answer questions and it may be a time when such a motion or charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4071)|
| 1:07:58| change is needed, but I don't see it at this point and I just think it's time to put it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4078)|
| 1:08:03| to sleep and recognizing that we welcome the cooperation of the executive office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4083)|
| 1:08:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4089)|
| 1:08:10| Councilman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4090)|
| 1:08:11| Going on, Councilman Dela Vopi, one of the unique characteristics of city council and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4091)|
| 1:08:16| the mayor's office is that we all work well together to move the city forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4096)|
| 1:08:20| We often see other examples nearby that do not function that well because there is so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4100)|
| 1:08:25| much dissension between two groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4105)|
| 1:08:27| So, I think that the system we have serves us very well and it would be foolhardy to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4107)|
| 1:08:33| change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4113)|
| 1:08:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4114)|
| 1:08:35| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4115)|
| 1:08:36| Well, Mr. Mayor, I just want to get your thoughts on this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4116)|
| 1:08:40| Yes, I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4120)|
| 1:08:41| And this obviously would have to, council can't just pass this, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4121)|
| 1:08:44| It has to go back to a vote to have a charter change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4124)|
| 1:08:48| So, in all likelihood, you know, depending on what happens, it wouldn't affect me much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4128)|
| 1:08:52| anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4132)|
| 1:08:53| My personal opinion, kind of stepping down from there, is I think there's a benefit to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4133)|
| 1:08:56| having the mayor engaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4136)|
| 1:08:57| And I think it's incumbent upon the mayor not to totally, you know, take over the council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4137)|
| 1:09:04| meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4144)|
| 1:09:05| It's council's meeting and I always try to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4145)|
| 1:09:06| When I have something I need to weigh in on, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4146)|
| 1:09:08| But I think it's important that it be council's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4148)|
| 1:09:11| That being said, I think it's worth it to have the mayor fully engaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4151)|
| 1:09:14| I'm talking down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4154)|
| 1:09:15| It's always worth it to have the mayor fully engaged in the process would be my thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4155)|
| 1:09:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4161)|
| 1:09:22| Right now, there's no more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4162)|
| 1:09:24| Oh, Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4164)|
| 1:09:25| Then I'd like to make a motion that we not accept this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4165)|
| 1:09:29| We could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4169)|
| 1:09:31| No action, does it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4171)|
| 1:09:32| We could just do no action if you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4172)|
| 1:09:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4173)|
| 1:09:34| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4174)|
| 1:09:35| That will work, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4175)|
| 1:09:36| Either way you want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4176)|
| 1:09:37| Right now, unless there's a motion to approve, it will die for lack of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4177)|
| 1:09:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4181)|
| 1:09:42| Not hearing one, we'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4182)|
| 1:09:44| 12B is an ordinance to amend the operating budget for fiscal year 2009-2010 to allow for completion of the Gay Street streetscapes project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4184)|
| 1:09:53| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4193)|
| 1:09:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4194)|
| 1:09:55| Ms. Rodney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4195)|
| 1:09:56| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4196)|
| 1:09:57| Mr. Martin, I had an instructive conversation with Mr. York this afternoon that I thought it might be worthwhile sharing with the rest of council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4197)|
| 1:10:06| and he indicated he had pulled a little bit to send down with you in terms of notes to this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4206)|
| 1:10:12| Sometimes it's confusing when we have two items on the same agenda relating to this project, and the numbers don't seem to match up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4212)|
| 1:10:20| Earlier in the evening, we had Resolution 11E that just related to the contract for the design services for this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4220)|
| 1:10:27| and indicated that with the change order, the design service contract would be $432,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4227)|
| 1:10:35| In reality, the total cost of this project is far greater than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4235)|
| 1:10:40| and obviously this budget amendment takes some monies from fund balance to continue to pay for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4240)|
| 1:10:46| My question to Mr. York was, you know, typically with capital projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4246)|
| 1:10:49| we're putting money, we're kind of stocking money away in our capital budget for a number of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4249)|
| 1:10:55| even before construction begins, to spread out that cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4255)|
| 1:10:58| And so I ask him, you know, how far back do we start anticipating for this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4258)|
| 1:11:03| Was there any money in the capital budget this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4263)|
| 1:11:06| And why all of a sudden do we need more than half a million dollars to get to the finish line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4266)|
| 1:11:11| Not that it's not a good project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4271)|
| 1:11:13| Fair question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4273)|
| 1:11:14| We're dealing with a very, very old stretch of roadway, and there were a lot of surprises along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4274)|
| 1:11:18| So can you just address the scope of the project a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4278)|
| 1:11:22| I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4282)|
| 1:11:24| Jim did share with me the conversation, Council Member Roddy, that you all had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4284)|
| 1:11:29| We actually started anticipating this project back in the 05-06 budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4289)|
| 1:11:35| There was a small amount budgeted at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4295)|
| 1:11:38| I suspect that was to hire a consultant to take a look at the scope of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4298)|
| 1:11:43| We got serious about it in the 06-07 budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4303)|
| 1:11:47| There was a million and a half budgeted there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4307)|
| 1:11:50| And then in each of the fiscal years, 07-08, 08-09, we budgeted a million dollars each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4310)|
| 1:11:58| That brought us to a total of $3.562 million, $3,562,000 at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4318)|
| 1:12:09| And now with the change orders that have been the council has seen along the way, that adds another $650,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4329)|
| 1:12:19| Well, it actually, to complicate it just a tad bit further, it really adds about $450,000 in actual change orders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4339)|
| 1:12:27| And I think we have, Steve, correct me if I'm wrong, something close to $200,000 in contingency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4347)|
| 1:12:34| that we hope would be ample to cover anything else unforeseen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4354)|
| 1:12:39| So in the total, when you add the $650,000 in to the $4,212,000, roughly $200,000 of that would be contingency dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4359)|
| 1:12:50| We get reimbursed from KUB for $1,172,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4370)|
| 1:12:55| So if all of it plays out, we will have about $5.4 million in total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4375)|
| 1:13:02| Did that address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4382)|
| 1:13:05| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4385)|
| 1:13:06| But of the $5.4 million, only $4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4386)|
| 1:13:09| Some million is, I mean, part of that is the KUB contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4389)|
| 1:13:12| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4392)|
| 1:13:13| The total $5,384,000, I think I misstated that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4393)|
| 1:13:18| The $5,384,000 is the total cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4398)|
| 1:13:21| $1,172,000 of that is from KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4401)|
| 1:13:25| So when you net it out, we're in the $4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4405)|
| 1:13:27| $4,212,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4407)|
| 1:13:28| $4 million range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4408)|
| 1:13:29| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4409)|
| 1:13:30| Again, with a couple of $100,000 in contingency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4410)|
| 1:13:32| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4412)|
| 1:13:33| Well, I know it's going to have a great outcome in the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4413)|
| 1:13:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4415)|
| 1:13:36| Your point, it has been a long process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4416)|
| 1:13:38| It's one of those, we didn't really have a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4418)|
| 1:13:40| It was a lot of money that we're spending, and there's things we'd rather spend money on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4420)|
| 1:13:43| but this was like fixing the roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4423)|
| 1:13:44| We had to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4424)|
| 1:13:45| And was there a reason why, when we did the budget last year, that we didn't have money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4425)|
| 1:13:49| Mr. York, I think that there were, although we set aside money in capital budgets in previous years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4429)|
| 1:13:54| that there was not any money budgeted in this year's capital budget for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4434)|
| 1:13:59| Do you remember, Steve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4439)|
| 1:14:00| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4440)|
| 1:14:01| Well, we didn't think we needed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4441)|
| 1:14:02| We thought we, based on our estimates, we thought we were in good shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4442)|
| 1:14:08| So we didn't, engineering did not request additional funds in the current year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4448)|
| 1:14:14| It's just a significant pull relative to the total cost of the project here at the finish line to still need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4454)|
| 1:14:20| And with old, old streetscapes like this, and you get underground, and you find contaminated soils,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4460)|
| 1:14:25| and there's just things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4465)|
| 1:14:27| That's a pretty good description.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4467)|
| 1:14:29| In tight budget times, I think it's instructive to know where the money goes sometimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4469)|
| 1:14:34| and you don't always have a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4474)|
| 1:14:36| Well said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4476)|
| 1:14:37| Councilman DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4477)|
| 1:14:38| Yes, I also had occasion to talk to Mr. York, and, of course, we're all interested in finishing this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4478)|
| 1:14:43| and we've all been here for several of these changes where pilings were not under,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4483)|
| 1:14:49| didn't have the proper support and whatnot, and we need to get the project finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4489)|
| 1:14:53| I did want to say that if I understand all the numbers swirling around and looking at the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4493)|
| 1:15:00| what I understood from Mr. York is that, in essence, when we dip into the general fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4500)|
| 1:15:05| we're basically taking rainy day dollars to finish this project since they weren't allocated or funded generally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4505)|
| 1:15:13| And that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4513)|
| 1:15:15| But it's not like we're shifting from column A to column B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4515)|
| 1:15:18| something we did about a month ago when we were just cleaning up the balance sheet for the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4518)|
| 1:15:25| This is actually money that we would otherwise save, but we have to spend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4525)|
| 1:15:29| because like most folks that remodel an old house, you run into stuff you don't anticipate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4529)|
| 1:15:34| Well said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4534)|
| 1:15:35| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4535)|
| 1:15:37| Mr. Martin, in reply to Councilwoman Ryder, you threw around quite a few millions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4537)|
| 1:15:42| and a few hundred thousands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4542)|
| 1:15:45| That ordinance be roughly, you're talking about 5.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4545)|
| 1:15:51| Is that what you said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4551)|
| 1:15:52| Yeah, roughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4552)|
| 1:15:53| If you include all costs, Councilmember Brown, it would be almost $5.4 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4553)|
| 1:15:59| assuming we spend all the contingency dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4559)|
| 1:16:04| Let me ask you, thinking in terms of stimulus money, is that involved in that in any way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4564)|
| 1:16:12| This does not, as far as I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4572)|
| 1:16:15| Does it, Steve, include any stimulus dollars at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4575)|
| 1:16:18| This was all prior to stimulus because the last time we actually budgeted was in the 08-09 budget cycle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4578)|
| 1:16:25| so it would not include any stimulus dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4585)|
| 1:16:29| We've been working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4589)|
| 1:16:30| And it was a project underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4590)|
| 1:16:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4592)|
| 1:16:33| Great questions, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4593)|
| 1:16:34| Any others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4594)|
| 1:16:35| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4595)|
| 1:16:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4596)|
| 1:16:37| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4597)|
| 1:16:38| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4598)|
| 1:16:39| This is an emergency ordinance appropriating the sum of $400 from the Community Improvement Fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4599)|
| 1:16:43| and donating the same to North Hills Garden Club to be utilized for their current improvement project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4603)|
| 1:16:47| to plant dogwoods within the community boulevards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4607)|
| 1:16:50| Requested by Councilmembers Della Volpe and Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4610)|
| 1:16:53| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4613)|
| 1:16:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4614)|
| 1:16:55| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4615)|
| 1:16:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4616)|
| 1:16:57| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4617)|
| 1:16:58| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4618)|
| 1:17:01| That being all the business to come before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4621)|
| 1:17:03| and seeing that we've outlasted almost our whole audience, we stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4623)|
| 1:17:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100223?start=4627)|
