| 0:12:02| for either of these gentlemen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=722)|

| 0:12:06| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=726)|
| 0:12:07| Josh, will you explain to us what you're going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=727)|
| 0:12:10| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=730)|
| 0:12:10| And I have another follow-up question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=730)|
| 0:12:12| Sure, I'd be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=732)|
| 0:12:13| So the ask is on the amendment change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=733)|
| 0:12:16| and the contract is to further define the word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=736)|
| 0:12:18| the definition of ALS, first responder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=738)|
| 0:12:21| to include a single resource paramedic in a quick response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=741)|
| 0:12:24| vehicle, which is also defined in the amendment change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=744)|
| 0:12:26| as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=746)|
| 0:12:27| Basically, what we're asking to do is really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=747)|
| 0:12:29| change the way we transport patients who don't necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=749)|
| 0:12:32| meet the level of a high-acuity transport| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=752)|
| 0:12:34| so that paramedic can then assess the patient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=754)|
| 0:12:38| put them in an advanced-level ambulance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=758)|
| 0:12:39| and then return to service and be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=759)|
| 0:12:41| a resource-available community as a single-resource paramedic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=761)|
| 0:12:44| Basically, what we're asking and looking to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=764)|
| 0:12:46| is to allow that ambulance to transport the lower-acuity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=766)|
| 0:12:49| patients that don't need paramedic-level care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=769)|
| 0:12:52| during the transport time and get the paramedic freed back up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=772)|
| 0:12:55| for the next high-level acuity call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=775)|
| 0:12:58| We were discussing that before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=778)|
| 0:13:01| Give us an update on Chairman Ron French of Blount County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=781)|
| 0:13:06| They're putting a paramedic at their hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=786)|
| 0:13:08| but you already have paramedics at the hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=788)|
| 0:13:10| but we're still backed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=790)|
| 0:13:12| Can you give us commissioners the view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=792)|
| 0:13:15| of what's really happening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=795)|
| 0:13:17| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=797)|
| 0:13:18| Holistically, there's a nationwide staffing shortage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=798)|
| 0:13:21| It's not just in EMS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=801)|
| 0:13:22| It's in many, many public sectors or many sectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=802)|
| 0:13:26| But certainly, EMS is no different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=806)|
| 0:13:28| We certainly feel the pain that others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=808)|
| 0:13:31| do when it comes to staffing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=811)|
| 0:13:33| And so one of the challenges that we're having,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=813)|
| 0:13:35| obviously, locally and nationally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=815)|
| 0:13:37| is there's just not enough EMS personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=817)|
| 0:13:40| And then also, there's issues and concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=820)|
| 0:13:42| with the hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=822)|
| 0:13:44| While they do a great job, simply put, they get backed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=824)|
| 0:13:47| And so it creates kind of a logjam| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=827)|
| 0:13:49| where paramedics are now sitting at the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=829)|
| 0:13:51| and are staying longer than they typically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=831)|
| 0:13:53| would and not getting back in service to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=833)|
| 0:13:56| That's not the hospital's problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=836)|
| 0:13:58| That's a holistic problem in health care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=838)|
| 0:14:00| right now that we're seeing everywhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=840)|
| 0:14:02| across the country, specifically here in Knox County as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=842)|
| 0:14:05| The one thing that we're proposing and looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=845)|
| 0:14:07| to do in Blount County that we already do in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=847)|
| 0:14:10| is what we call surge, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=850)|
| 0:14:12| where an ambulance arrives at the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=852)|
| 0:14:14| and they can offload their patients to another EMS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=854)|
| 0:14:18| personnel employed by AMR and then get those ambulances back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=858)|
| 0:14:23| into the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=863)|
| 0:14:23| So essentially, we're doing that at most all of the hospitals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=863)|
| 0:14:26| right now, different times of the day as it peaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=866)|
| 0:14:28| We'll provide one of our crew members in the facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=868)|
| 0:14:31| to offload three or four lower acuity patients that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=871)|
| 0:14:34| aren't going to go directly to the ER.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=874)|
| 0:14:35| That frees those other two or three ambulances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=875)|
| 0:14:37| back up to be in the community responding to 911 calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=877)|
| 0:14:43| Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=883)|
| 0:14:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=885)|
| 0:14:47| Josh, on what you're doing with this ambulance service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=887)|
| 0:14:50| is that a one person or two person in that vehicle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=890)|
| 0:14:54| That would be just one person, one paramedic level care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=894)|
| 0:14:57| in the quick response vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=897)|
| 0:14:59| OK, now who determines that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=899)|
| 0:15:01| changing a definition of a non-life threatening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=901)|
| 0:15:07| to this quick response?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=907)|
| 0:15:09| Will that also take care of lift assist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=909)|
| 0:15:12| They would be available to respond to lift assist as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=912)|
| 0:15:15| yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=915)|
| 0:15:17| OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=917)|
| 0:15:18| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=918)|
| 0:15:20| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=920)|
| 0:15:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=923)|
| 0:15:25| What kind of a vehicle is a quick response vehicle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=925)|
| 0:15:28| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=928)|
| 0:15:29| So typically, they could be anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=929)|
| 0:15:31| from a Tahoe to an Expedition, similar like a police car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=931)|
| 0:15:34| per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=934)|
| 0:15:36| What we have on order are F-150 pickup trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=936)|
| 0:15:39| Upon approval, that will be brought in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=939)|
| 0:15:42| We currently use Expeditions and F-250 pickup trucks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=942)|
| 0:15:45| for these vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=945)|
| 0:15:46| It's not necessarily about, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=946)|
| 0:15:48| the quick response vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=948)|
| 0:15:49| It's not necessarily about driving quicker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=949)|
| 0:15:52| but just basically more nimble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=952)|
| 0:15:54| Get these vehicles into the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=954)|
| 0:15:56| where they're needed quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=956)|
| 0:15:58| OK, and then will the employees of the 911 center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=958)|
| 0:16:02| have to have additional training so they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=962)|
| 0:16:04| going to determine whether to send a one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=964)|
| 0:16:07| person or a two person response?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=969)|
| 0:16:10| Essentially, the response remains the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| Now, instead of getting two people in one ambulance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=973)|
| 0:16:15| you may get one person in a vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=975)|
| 0:16:17| and two people in the ambulance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| We still have to respond with an advanced level paramedic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=979)|
| 0:16:23| and an EMT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=983)|
| 0:16:24| The only thing that changes is the transport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=984)|
| 0:16:26| After the paramedic assesses that patient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=986)|
| 0:16:27| if it's a non-life-threatening illness or injury,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=987)|
| 0:16:31| they can be then transported by a lower acuity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=991)|
| 0:16:33| ambulance and keeping that paramedic available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=993)|
| 0:16:35| OK, and then for the health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=995)|
| 0:16:38| the contract will still maintain the same standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=998)|
| 0:16:42| as far as the renewal dates and all that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1002)|
| 0:16:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1005)|
| 0:16:45| Nothing changes there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1005)|
| 0:16:46| Not a change there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1006)|
| 0:16:47| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1007)|
| 0:16:51| Any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1011)|
| 0:16:53| Thank you, Josh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1013)|
| 0:16:54| Thank you, Kevin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1014)|
| 0:16:55| Thanks, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1015)|
| 0:16:56| The motion before us is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1016)|
| 0:16:58| That motion is by Commissioner Busler with a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1018)|

| 0:17:01| This would move this item to the consent agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1021)|

| 0:17:11| I thought it was for approval, but it wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1031)|
| 0:17:13| It was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1033)|
| 0:17:14| It would move it to consent for next week, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1034)|
| 0:17:17| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1037)|

| 0:17:49| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1069)|
| 0:17:50| Commissioner Jay, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1070)|
| 0:17:53| I'd like to offer a substitute motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| or just ask the sponsor if we might change that to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1075)|
| 0:17:57| forward without recommendation next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1077)|
| 0:17:59| given that we're going to have a workshop after this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1079)|
| 0:18:02| I'll allow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1082)|
| 0:18:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1083)|
| 0:18:05| Commissioner Biggs, you'll amend your motion to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1085)|
| 0:18:08| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1088)|
| 0:18:09| Just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1089)|
| 0:18:10| OK with that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| Mr. Ward, you with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1092)|
| 0:18:13| Commissioner Daley, do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1093)|
| 0:18:15| OK, you're good with that too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1095)|
| 0:18:17| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1097)|
| 0:18:20| So the motion on the floor by Commissioner Biggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1100)|
| 0:18:22| second by Commissioner Ward, is to move this item forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1102)|

| 0:18:27| That means it will be on the non-consent agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1107)|
| 0:18:29| for next week's commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1109)|

| 0:18:41| approving an amendment to the Knox County Employee Benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| System to provide for a medical expense retirement plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1124)|

| 0:19:15| I was actually the one who pulled this in case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1155)|
| 0:19:17| commissioners had any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1157)|
| 0:19:19| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1159)|
| 0:19:20| I see the finance director is near the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1160)|
| 0:19:22| Do they want to just give us a quick overview?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1162)|
| 0:19:24| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1164)|
| 0:19:25| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1165)|
| 0:19:27| Mr. Caldwell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1167)|
| 0:19:29| Ms. Schrader?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1169)|
| 0:19:30| Either of you like to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1170)|
| 0:19:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1172)|
| 0:19:33| Basically, I'm going to make this as simple as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1173)|
| 0:19:37| During the budget this past year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1177)|
| 0:19:39| we were looking and exploring our current MERP setup,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1179)|
| 0:19:43| as we call it, the Medical Expense Retirement Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1183)|
| 0:19:45| about giving our employees the ability to retire early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1185)|
| 0:19:49| and have money for health insurance expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1189)|
| 0:19:52| And so all this is doing is raising the match by from 25%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1192)|
| 0:19:58| to 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1198)|
| 0:19:59| It's equivalent to, we think, about $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1199)|
| 0:20:02| And it was in the budget that was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1202)|
| 0:20:04| And we just wanted to go through the process to get it approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1204)|
| 0:20:08| as a plan amendment change for the retirement board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1208)|
| 0:20:12| And it will take effect January 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1212)|
| 0:20:16| Thank you very much, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1216)|
| 0:20:17| Any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1217)|
| 0:20:21| The motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1221)|
| 0:20:22| Motion is by Commissioner Jay, second by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1222)|
| 0:20:25| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1225)|
| 0:20:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1226)|
| 0:20:27| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1227)|
| 0:20:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1229)|
| 0:20:30| That motion moves forward to the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1230)|
| 0:20:33| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1233)|
| 0:20:36| Item number 46.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1236)|
| 0:20:38| It's resolution 906.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| It's amending the Knox County Commission rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1240)|
| 0:20:43| to move rule 6, section I, zoning ordinances to rule 7| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1243)|
| 0:20:49| and to provide for various amendments to rule 7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1249)|
| 0:20:52| rezoning requests and appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1252)|
| 0:20:56| Chair, we'll look for a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1256)|
| 0:20:57| Motion to send with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1257)|
| 0:20:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1259)|
| 0:21:00| I have a motion to send forward with no recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1260)|
| 0:21:02| by Commissioner Daley with a second by Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1262)|
| 0:21:07| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1267)|
| 0:21:09| I actually pulled this from consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1269)|
| 0:21:10| so someone from the rules committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1270)|
| 0:21:12| could speak to what the specific changes are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1272)|
| 0:21:16| Commissioner Jay, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1277)|
| 0:21:19| I worked with the rules committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1279)|
| 0:21:20| to draft these changes related to our rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1280)|
| 0:21:25| We had a workshop related to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| And we all came together, along with members of the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1289)|
| 0:21:32| to review our very antiquated zoning rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1292)|
| 0:21:36| and worked on different items that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| would help expedite the process, clean up some of the language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1298)|
| 0:21:42| modernize it a bit, and also to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1302)|
| 0:21:45| some good balance between the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1305)|
| 0:21:47| and those seeking rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1307)|
| 0:21:50| So the red line addition that is attached to the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1310)|
| 0:21:54| will certainly give the specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1314)|
| 0:21:57| But ultimately, the biggest changes in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1317)|
| 0:22:01| were about how many sort of, I hate to say it this way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1321)|
| 0:22:05| how many strikes, three strikes you're out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1325)|
| 0:22:08| If you're asking for deferrals, giving a particular timeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1328)|
| 0:22:12| so that deferrals can't go on forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| Also putting in some provisions so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1335)|
| 0:22:16| that withdrawals can't be done at the very last minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1336)|
| 0:22:20| And it essentially looked at the last two or three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1340)|
| 0:22:23| and looked at opportunities to prevent some of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1343)|
| 0:22:27| that have happened where somebody maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1347)|
| 0:22:29| saw a vote that wasn't going to go their way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1349)|
| 0:22:31| withdrew at the last minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1351)|
| 0:22:32| It kind of closes that loophole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1352)|
| 0:22:33| It also puts in some provisions to really respect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1353)|
| 0:22:36| the community in a way that puts some deadlines on requesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1356)|
| 0:22:41| deferrals in advance of the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| so there wasn't sort of a last minute pull it off the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1363)|
| 0:22:46| and people were sitting here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1366)|
| 0:22:47| I have talked to some of the members of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1367)|
| 0:22:51| community and along with some consultation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| with the Realtors Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1374)|
| 0:22:55| And I may introduce a slight tweak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1375)|
| 0:22:58| to the timeline of that within a number of days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1378)|
| 0:23:01| But I think it would keep in the letter of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1381)|
| 0:23:03| we all worked on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1383)|
| 0:23:05| But ultimately, it's cleaning up the language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1385)|
| 0:23:07| trying to make it more logical, and certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1387)|
| 0:23:10| make it more productive when we come to our zoning meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1390)|
| 0:23:14| Thank you very much, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1394)|
| 0:23:15| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| Commissioner Daley, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1396)|
| 0:23:19| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1399)|
| 0:23:20| I also would like to add that as it's written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1400)|
| 0:23:22| I don't know if Mr. Jay will try to amend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1402)|
| 0:23:26| but we have 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1406)|
| 0:23:29| That's four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| And a safety factor is always built in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| that we can always suspend rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| We have someone here on the fourth month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1415)|
| 0:23:39| and we understand that they want to work it out a way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1419)|
| 0:23:42| We still can always suspend rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1422)|
| 0:23:45| So we wanted to get this timeline in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1425)|
| 0:23:48| to hopefully get it done within that four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1428)|
| 0:23:50| 120 days should be enough to get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1430)|
| 0:23:54| Thank you, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1434)|
| 0:23:56| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1436)|
| 0:23:57| Yes, the one part that I'm looking at potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1437)|
| 0:24:01| amending is section G. This was the request for a deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1441)|
| 0:24:06| We, as a committee, passed out one week of writing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1446)|
| 0:24:11| and that said that a withdrawal request, postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1451)|
| 0:24:14| of withdrawal requests, to be done no later than 4 PM,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| one week in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1456)|
| 0:24:19| I'm going to do some more discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1459)|
| 0:24:21| but I may amend that to be the Wednesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1461)|
| 0:24:25| pushing that back a couple of days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1465)|
| 0:24:26| and be the Wednesday prior to the meeting, which would still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1466)|
| 0:24:30| allow for the agenda to be published on Thursday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1470)|
| 0:24:33| with the accuracy, but give a few more days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1473)|
| 0:24:35| A few members of the building community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1475)|
| 0:24:37| have expressed that sometimes they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1477)|
| 0:24:39| waiting on information from other vendors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| or third party participants that comes in at the last moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1482)|
| 0:24:46| and if they could have a few more days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1486)|
| 0:24:48| I think the intent in that is always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1488)|
| 0:24:49| to make sure that before the agenda is published| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1489)|
| 0:24:52| that anything that is deferred is communicated to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1492)|
| 0:24:56| So I still think it keeps within the spirit of our committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1496)|
| 0:25:00| hoping to make sure that the community doesn't show up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1500)|
| 0:25:03| for no reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1503)|
| 0:25:04| But I'll introduce that next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1504)|
| 0:25:06| and it's not a substantial change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1506)|
| 0:25:09| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1509)|
| 0:25:10| I did want to say thank you to the members of the Rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| Committee for taking this on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1512)|
| 0:25:13| This definitely needed to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1513)|
| 0:25:16| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1516)|
| 0:25:18| The motion by Commissioner Daley is to move this forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1518)|
| 0:25:21| with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1521)|
| 0:25:22| That is seconded by Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1522)|
| 0:25:25| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1527)|
| 0:25:27| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| That will move forward to the non-consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1529)|
| 0:25:33| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1533)|
| 0:25:34| Item number 50 is Resolution 910.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1534)|
| 0:25:38| It's to join with the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1538)|
| 0:25:41| and other local governments as participants in the Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1541)|

| 0:25:48| and authorize an execution of any related settlement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1548)|
| 0:25:51| agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1551)|
| 0:25:53| Mr. Chairman, motion to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1553)|
| 0:25:57| Motion to move forward with no recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1557)|
| 0:25:59| by Commissioner Schoonmaker, second by Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1559)|
| 0:26:02| Commissioner Schoonmaker, you have the floor, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1562)|
| 0:26:04| I think it was Mr. Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1566)|
| 0:26:07| It was Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1567)|
| 0:26:08| They sound the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1568)|
| 0:26:10| You have the floor, Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1570)|
| 0:26:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1572)|
| 0:26:15| Last week, Commissioners Bussler and Commissioner Daley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1575)|
| 0:26:20| and myself attended a presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| from the Tennessee Attorney General regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| the opioid settlement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1585)|
| 0:26:27| And we have a resolution in the law director's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1587)|
| 0:26:32| that is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1592)|
| 0:26:35| We are waiting to make sure that it is 100% perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1595)|
| 0:26:40| We should know that answer tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1600)|
| 0:26:43| But basically, the counties are responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1603)|
| 0:26:47| if they want to participate before January 2nd of 2022,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1607)|
| 0:26:51| which is the filing deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1611)|
| 0:26:53| And those counties that participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1613)|
| 0:26:56| will end up actually having the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1616)|
| 0:27:01| to have about 35% of the available funds, which could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1621)|
| 0:27:05| amount to about $150 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1625)|
| 0:27:08| So this has been, according to the Tennessee Attorney General,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1628)|
| 0:27:12| it's been a very long and drawn out process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1632)|
| 0:27:16| with a lot of attorneys involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1636)|
| 0:27:19| But it's kind of one of those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1639)|
| 0:27:22| where we need to get this on the books| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| so we can show that we want to participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1644)|
| 0:27:26| and we want to have that money flowing back into Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| So I did give you a fact sheet prior to the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1649)|
| 0:27:33| that it's on your desk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| And the resolution will be available online| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| for the full commission agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1658)|
| 0:27:43| Thank you very much, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| The motion, I believe, is to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1668)|
| 0:27:50| with no recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1670)|
| 0:27:52| That's correct, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1672)|
| 0:27:52| And I did want to just say that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1672)|
| 0:27:55| appreciate our colleagues in Williamson County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1675)|
| 0:27:58| who helped us with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| So it's nice to have that somebody from Middle Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1680)|
| 0:28:03| help out somebody in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1683)|
| 0:28:05| Very nice indeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| Motion is to move forward with no recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1687)|
| 0:28:10| by Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1690)|
| 0:28:11| And the second is by Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1693)|
| 0:28:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1695)|
| 0:28:15| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1695)|
| 0:28:18| The resolution moves to next week's non-consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1698)|
| 0:28:22| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1702)|

| 0:28:34| by repealing sections 42-51 through 42-66| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1714)|

| 0:29:58| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1798)|
| 0:30:03| I'll remind commissioners this is an ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| so we will have to move to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1808)|
| 0:30:08| We'll have to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1808)|
| 0:30:10| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1812)|
| 0:30:13| Second is by Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1813)|
| 0:30:14| We have a motion by Commissioner Busler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| to move forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| Second by Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1818)|
| 0:30:20| This is an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| It does not require a 2 thirds vote to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1822)|
| 0:30:24| to the meeting, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1824)|
| 0:30:25| But it would require a 2 thirds vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1825)|
| 0:30:27| in order to pass on first reading next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| Commissioner Daley, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1829)|
| 0:30:32| Yeah, can we get an explanation from the law department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1832)|
| 0:30:34| And I see the merit counsel here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| What's going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1836)|
| 0:30:40| You went along with the short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1840)|
| 0:30:42| Because it's complicated law, like the Jordan case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1842)|
| 0:30:45| back 15 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1845)|
| 0:30:46| I'll try to make it short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1846)|
| 0:30:48| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1848)|
| 0:30:49| This, like the Jordan case that many of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1849)|
| 0:30:51| may remember from 15 years ago, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1851)|
| 0:30:55| kind of the law of unintended consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1855)|
| 0:31:01| Back then, if you recall, when we put in the term limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1861)|
| 0:31:08| some of the constitutional officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| filed a suit up in Chancery Court saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1870)|
| 0:31:13| did it apply to them as constitutional officers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1873)|
| 0:31:16| And that was the sole question before the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1876)|
| 0:31:18| Well, the chancellor, being the chancellor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1878)|
| 0:31:21| goes back and starts from day one on the charter and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1881)|
| 0:31:25| oh, by the way, you don't even have a charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| You do not have a legal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1887)|
| 0:31:31| Because you didn't follow the terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| of what the charter statute said you had to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1893)|
| 0:31:37| That went up to the Tennessee Supreme Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| And the Tennessee Supreme Court agreed with the chancellor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1899)|
| 0:31:43| and said, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1903)|
| 0:31:44| You do not have a legal government or a legal charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1904)|
| 0:31:48| because you did not follow the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1908)|
| 0:31:51| That was an unintended consequence of the lawsuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1911)|
| 0:31:54| that was brought simply to ask whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| term limits applied to constitutional officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| This is the same type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1920)|
| 0:32:01| What's happened here is, in the Merit Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1921)|
| 0:32:04| there was an issue brought up in front of the three-member Merit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1924)|
| 0:32:08| Council about whether or not the sheriff could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1928)|
| 0:32:11| be ordered by the Merit Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1931)|
| 0:32:15| The Merit Council had authority to tell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| the sheriff and the taxpayers that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| had to supply a non-uniformed administrative person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1939)|
| 0:32:26| a late model Chevy Impala car, and a gas credit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1946)|
| 0:32:29| card for her own personal use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1949)|
| 0:32:32| The opinion of the law department at that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1952)|
| 0:32:34| and of the sheriff's outside counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1954)|
| 0:32:36| I didn't represent the sheriff in that one, was, no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| you can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1958)|
| 0:32:40| You have no authority to tell the taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1960)|
| 0:32:42| that they've got to supply a personal use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1962)|
| 0:32:44| car, a gas credit card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1964)|
| 0:32:47| The result of that was, as outside counsel was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1967)|
| 0:32:51| the sheriff's counsel was representing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| the sheriff, which the sheriff is entitled representation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| filed a lawsuit in Chantry Court contesting that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1978)|
| 0:33:02| And amongst one of the issues in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| was talked about the state law, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1984)|
| 0:33:08| was passed in 1974, which was four years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1988)|
| 0:33:11| after the original private act setting the Merit Council here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1991)|
| 0:33:17| and referred to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1997)|
| 0:33:18| And I thought when I read that, although I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| involved in that, I said, that just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2000)|
| 0:33:22| doesn't sound right because we don't operate under state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2002)|
| 0:33:27| Well, so here's the unintended consequence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2007)|
| 0:33:30| Went back to see whether there was a problem there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2010)|
| 0:33:35| and indeed there was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| And that set out pretty much as best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| I could do in the whereas clauses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| Right now, if it went in front of the chancellor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| and the chancellor ruled the same way he did in the Jordan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2023)|
| 0:33:46| case, we're going to have a chancellor that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2026)|
| 0:33:49| you hadn't got a merit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2029)|
| 0:33:51| You don't have one because you didn't follow the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2031)|
| 0:33:55| Now, what's the consequence of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2035)|
| 0:33:56| What the Supreme Court said in the Jordan case was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2036)|
| 0:34:01| I realize you've been operating under this for 15 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| so I want to declare that you had a de facto government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2044)|
| 0:34:08| So what you did in passing those resolutions and ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2048)|
| 0:34:12| would be valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2052)|
| 0:34:13| But by golly, you better get it done right going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2053)|
| 0:34:17| So that's the situation that this is in right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2057)|
| 0:34:20| This lawsuit tries to stove that up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2060)|
| 0:34:24| so that if the lawyer representing the sheriff pushes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2064)|
| 0:34:29| that issue in front of a chancellor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| we won't wind up with the chancellor saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| you don't have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2072)|
| 0:34:33| Now, what's the difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| Virtually no difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| The protections for the uniformed officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| and in fact, all employees under the state statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2080)|
| 0:34:45| is the same as it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2085)|
| 0:34:48| And the merit council as it is now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| has virtually the same power, not virtually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2090)|
| 0:34:53| it does have the same powers under the state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2093)|
| 0:34:56| that it has under this ordinance that they have modified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2096)|
| 0:34:59| from year to year, which is a different story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2099)|
| 0:35:03| That's the long story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2103)|
| 0:35:04| So what we're trying to do with this, what I'm trying to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| is get this done where that's not an issue anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2107)|
| 0:35:11| and that we have a merit system protecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2111)|
| 0:35:14| all of the uniformed officers on the same standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2114)|
| 0:35:19| that we have right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2119)|
| 0:35:22| And the rules, the other part of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| is that the merit council can adopt rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2124)|
| 0:35:29| Most of what the merit council has now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2129)|
| 0:35:31| are the rules that they have previously adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2131)|
| 0:35:34| If you adopt this motion and establish the merit council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2134)|
| 0:35:39| under this, all the merit council's got to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2139)|
| 0:35:41| is say, we adopt our rules that we've been operating on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2141)|
| 0:35:44| And so there's no change whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2144)|
| 0:35:47| So that's the short story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2147)|
| 0:35:51| Thank you, Mr. Boock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| Any further questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2153)|
| 0:35:57| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2157)|
| 0:35:58| I've got, I'm thinking of this from a business perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2158)|
| 0:36:08| so kind of stay with me on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2168)|
| 0:36:11| The law director is my personal counsel as a commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2171)|
| 0:36:15| That's his job, to counsel me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| And he's bringing forth legislation for me to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2177)|
| 0:36:20| So who do I turn to now to counsel me on this legislation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2180)|
| 0:36:24| Because for me to do my research from this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2184)|
| 0:36:28| to next week, where I have to vote on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| I would typically go to the law director and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| hey, what is your professional opinion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| Who do I now go to for a professional opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2195)|
| 0:36:38| on this piece of legislation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| Because I can't go to him because he's, at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| a bias factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| Because I'm voting on his legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| It's not any of our legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| Thank you, Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2209)|
| 0:36:52| I did have a question, and this is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2212)|
| 0:36:54| an adversarial question, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2214)|
| 0:36:55| I was asked this by someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2215)|
| 0:36:58| Can the law director initiate an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2218)|
| 0:37:01| without a commissioner as a sponsor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2221)|
| 0:37:04| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2224)|
| 0:37:04| The law directors initiate a lot of ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2224)|
| 0:37:07| And that's what's been done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2227)|
| 0:37:10| It's been done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2230)|
| 0:37:14| My recollection is back in 1990 when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2234)|
| 0:37:19| they did all this charter thing, that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| were some ordinances that were requested by the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2242)|
| 0:37:26| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| Any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2248)|
| 0:37:30| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| I want to ask the first question is, do we have a charter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2254)|
| 0:37:41| Do we have a valid charter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2261)|
| 0:37:44| We have a valid charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2264)|
| 0:37:46| The way that charter amendment talked, and not the amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2266)|
| 0:37:50| but the way the charter talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| was that when you enacted a charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2272)|
| 0:37:55| you could enact and incorporate all private acts, OK?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2275)|
| 0:38:03| But that would keep the private act in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2283)|
| 0:38:06| Well, two things happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2286)|
| 0:38:07| Number one, they didn't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2287)|
| 0:38:11| It was an opt-in, not opt-out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2291)|
| 0:38:12| Do what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2292)|
| 0:38:13| It was an opt-in to private acts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| not opt-out of the private acts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2295)|
| 0:38:16| It was in automatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2296)|
| 0:38:17| You didn't have to take any action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| But the action taken at that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| was to rescind all private acts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2301)|
| 0:38:25| There was a list of what they rescinded as private acts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2305)|
| 0:38:28| Then they went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2308)|
| 0:38:29| So when that was done, there was no merit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2309)|
| 0:38:33| It was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2313)|
| 0:38:34| So then the only way they could get a merit system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| was to take over the state statute of 1974,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2316)|
| 0:38:41| which read virtually the same as the private act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2321)|
| 0:38:44| that the legislature had given us in 1970.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2324)|
| 0:38:50| So when they did that, they didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2330)|
| 0:38:52| follow the Merit System Council Act of 1974.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2332)|
| 0:38:59| Bottom line is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| That's going to get litigated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| It's going to be expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2343)|
| 0:39:05| The chancellor might rule the same way he did in Jordan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| and he might not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2347)|
| 0:39:08| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| But there's one way to prevent it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2350)|
| 0:39:12| Were there any other private acts that were excluded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2352)|
| 0:39:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| They rescinded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2358)|
| 0:39:20| If you look in the front of the black book,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2360)|
| 0:39:23| there's a rescission of, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2363)|
| 0:39:26| there's 20 some odd private acts that were rescinded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2366)|
| 0:39:30| Did the county commission at that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| take up action to reinstate all the policies and ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2372)|
| 0:39:36| in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2376)|
| 0:39:37| No, they did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2377)|
| 0:39:38| They picked and chose what they wanted to redo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2378)|
| 0:39:41| and then they redid their own version of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2381)|
| 0:39:44| They didn't just come in and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| we're going to take the private act of 1970.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| They created their own new ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2389)|
| 0:39:53| Are there any other areas in which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2393)|
| 0:39:56| we need to address this because of these actions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2396)|
| 0:40:00| That I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2400)|
| 0:40:01| The only reason I know of this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2401)|
| 0:40:02| is because it's in litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| It's going to be litigated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| How did it take this long, since 1990,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2406)|
| 0:40:09| for anyone to discover this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| Well, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2411)|
| 0:40:11| It took 16 years for them to discover in the Jordan case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2411)|
| 0:40:15| that they didn't have a charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2415)|
| 0:40:16| So I don't know why on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2416)|
| 0:40:18| That's what I say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2418)|
| 0:40:19| It's the law of unintended consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2419)|
| 0:40:22| It never would have happened if the Merit Council hadn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2422)|
| 0:40:25| said that the sheriff and the taxpayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| that the Merit Council would tell the sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2427)|
| 0:40:29| and taxpayers they've got to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2429)|
| 0:40:32| a private vehicle and a credit card to an employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2432)|
| 0:40:39| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2441)|
| 0:40:45| The motion is to move this forward to next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2445)|
| 0:40:50| with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2450)|
| 0:40:54| Do we need to do a roll call vote to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| Because it's an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2456)|
| 0:40:56| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2456)|
| 0:40:57| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2457)|
| 0:40:58| Thank you, Chairman Boehler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2458)|
| 0:41:02| I was hoping, earlier I asked for Chief Rubble| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2462)|
| 0:41:05| to be here from the Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2465)|
| 0:41:07| He was actually in the law director's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| back in 1990, whenever this was originally drafted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2469)|
| 0:41:13| He could probably have a better grasp on some of the things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2473)|
| 0:41:15| And hopefully some representation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2475)|
| 0:41:19| would have been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2479)|
| 0:41:20| I see Merit Council's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| I have a plethora of questions as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2482)|
| 0:41:27| But what Commissioner Ward was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2487)|
| 0:41:28| I believe in that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| And we keep going back to the same old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2490)|
| 0:41:33| I feel like we're talking about a specific case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2493)|
| 0:41:36| who the Sheriff's Office has their outside legal counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2496)|
| 0:41:39| And he's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2499)|
| 0:41:39| And everybody has their own outside legal counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2499)|
| 0:41:41| So I'm under the impression that we're probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| getting pretty close to needing that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| And I don't care to make a substitute motion for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| But I think that might take a little bit longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| than next Monday before we can get our own outside counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2509)|
| 0:41:53| So how would that motion look, Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2513)|
| 0:42:01| I don't know that that motion would apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| to this particular ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2523)|
| 0:42:07| I mean, if you're looking to seek outside counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| for the commission, I suppose you'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2529)|
| 0:42:11| have to make a separate motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| And it wouldn't affect this ordinance at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2533)|
| 0:42:17| I don't know that it would pertain to this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2537)|
| 0:42:21| You could postpone the ordinance until you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2541)|
| 0:42:22| get legal counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2542)|
| 0:42:23| You could postpone the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2543)|
| 0:42:24| I would think we'd want to do that at the voting meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2544)|
| 0:42:26| though, wouldn't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2546)|
| 0:42:27| OK, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2547)|
| 0:42:28| I'll wait until next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2548)|
| 0:42:29| I do want to point out, this lawsuit is ongoing up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2549)|
| 0:42:34| And we could get a decision adverse to that by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2554)|
| 0:42:38| and it well could be that the chancellor says, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2558)|
| 0:42:41| you ain't got a merit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2561)|
| 0:42:44| I'm just saying this is a very easy, easy, slam dunk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2564)|
| 0:42:48| easy way to cure the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2568)|
| 0:42:53| I'm sure commissioners will have further questions next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2573)|
| 0:42:56| at the voting meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2576)|
| 0:42:57| Commissioner Ward, do you have the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| I just want to clarify, you and I have a very good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2581)|
| 0:43:02| You know I always go to you for this kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2582)|
| 0:43:04| For me, in my business life and in my commission life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2584)|
| 0:43:07| I always have a lawyer that I go to to check myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2587)|
| 0:43:11| That's what you're there for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2591)|
| 0:43:12| You're my guide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| In this circumstance, I can't go to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2594)|
| 0:43:16| I want to make sure you understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2596)|
| 0:43:18| it's not like a personal thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| I'm just telling you, here's what I'm telling you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2600)|
| 0:43:22| There's a lawsuit going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2602)|
| 0:43:23| It's going to be decided by a chancellor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2603)|
| 0:43:27| one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2607)|
| 0:43:28| I'm just telling you that that's what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2608)|
| 0:43:30| That's a fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2610)|
| 0:43:31| And I'm giving you a way out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2611)|
| 0:43:33| I'm not saying it's right, wrong, or indifferent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2613)|
| 0:43:36| I'm just saying you've got a lawsuit going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2616)|
| 0:43:38| and it's going to be answered by the chancellor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2618)|
| 0:43:40| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2620)|
| 0:43:41| I also have an obligation to the 50,000 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| that elected me to make sure I make the right decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2623)|
| 0:43:46| So me seeking legal counsel, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2626)|
| 0:43:49| is the best way to find out what the right decision is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| I'm not saying that you're wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| You're probably right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2633)|
| 0:43:54| But I can't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| You wouldn't have said it if it wasn't right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2636)|
| 0:43:58| I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2638)|
| 0:43:59| Like I said, you and I have a good relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| But I need to make sure that I do my due diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| So if there is an option that we use legal counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2643)|
| 0:44:07| from another department, I'm open to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2647)|
| 0:44:12| I'm like the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2652)|
| 0:44:13| If you have the authority under the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2653)|
| 0:44:16| to hire counsel, the commission does, and hire counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| and pay him, that's your choice if that's what you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2660)|
| 0:44:25| But it's not going to change what happens up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| in the chancellery court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2667)|
| 0:44:28| Understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2668)|
| 0:44:31| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| Mr. Law Director, I have a couple more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| I'm trying to get clarity of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2677)|
| 0:44:38| I just got this Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2678)|
| 0:44:40| And I do have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2680)|
| 0:44:43| I don't want to wait until next week to ask them all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| because I want to try to figure out between now and then where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2685)|
| 0:44:49| I stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2689)|
| 0:44:53| You said this is because an ongoing current lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2693)|
| 0:44:56| And I guess your speculation is that if the chancellery decides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2696)|
| 0:45:01| he can say that, we don't have a legitimate merit counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2701)|
| 0:45:07| But at the same time, didn't the chancellor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2707)|
| 0:45:10| once look at our charter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| And we didn't have a legitimate charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| but we've been operating as such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| And they let that stand, because that might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2716)|
| 0:45:18| be the same circumstance with the merit counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2718)|
| 0:45:21| I referenced that earlier when I said that the Supreme Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2721)|
| 0:45:25| said that, oh, for those prior 16 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2725)|
| 0:45:28| you had a de facto government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| So the ordinances and resolutions you passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| are valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| So that's what the Supreme Court said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| And I said the same thing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2736)|
| 0:45:38| What they've done in the past would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2738)|
| 0:45:39| be a de facto merit counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2739)|
| 0:45:44| And you think that would have bearing on how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2744)|
| 0:45:45| the chancellor would rule?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2745)|
| 0:45:48| I believe the chancellor, if he looks at the facts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| the chancellor for certain is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2750)|
| 0:45:52| to look at the Jordan case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2752)|
| 0:45:54| No question, no chancellor would not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2754)|
| 0:45:57| look at the Jordan versus Knox County case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2757)|
| 0:46:00| How he determines or interprets it and the facts, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2760)|
| 0:46:04| I'm not passing judgment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| And I'm not involved in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2766)|
| 0:46:08| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2768)|
| 0:46:10| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2770)|
| 0:46:11| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2771)|
| 0:46:12| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| This will be on a first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2774)|
| 0:46:15| We've got two readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2775)|
| 0:46:17| I would suggest that if Commissioner Ward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2777)|
| 0:46:20| get a hold of the comptroller's office, send that resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2780)|
| 0:46:24| and you get an answer out of the comptroller's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2784)|
| 0:46:27| I think that would be the first step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2787)|
| 0:46:29| before we even talk about hiring a public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2789)|
| 0:46:31| Let's get an opinion from the comptroller's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2791)|
| 0:46:36| Thank you, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2798)|
| 0:46:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2799)|
| 0:46:40| I would also just encourage everybody to maybe start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2800)|
| 0:46:42| a thread on our commission forum with any pertinent questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2802)|
| 0:46:45| I'm sure we all might have similar questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2805)|
| 0:46:47| or might want to learn about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| And that's a good way for us to all communicate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2809)|
| 0:46:52| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| Any further questions from commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2814)|
| 0:46:59| The motion before us is to move this ordinance forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2819)|
| 0:47:02| with no recommendation for a first reading at next week's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2822)|

| 0:47:24| That moves forward to next week's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2844)|

| 0:47:46| adopted May 28, 1996.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2866)|

| 0:48:23| Mr. Chairman, if I might on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| Yes, Mr. Booth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2905)|
| 0:48:26| I was surprised I didn't get any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2906)|
| 0:48:28| from any of the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2908)|
| 0:48:29| But if any commissioners have any question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2909)|
| 0:48:32| on this statutory, what I consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2912)|
| 0:48:35| the only way to have a statutory merit system, give me a call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2915)|
| 0:48:39| I'll be glad to talk to you, answer any of your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2919)|
| 0:48:43| Thank you, Mr. Booth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2923)|
| 0:48:46| We have no one signed up for public forum for the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2926)|
| 0:48:49| work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2929)|
| 0:48:51| Chair will look to Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2933)|
| 0:48:54| I appreciate the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2934)|
| 0:48:56| I'd just like to take a moment to recognize Girl Scout Troop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2936)|
| 0:49:00| 22204 from West Hills Elementary, who are joining us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108?start=2940)|
