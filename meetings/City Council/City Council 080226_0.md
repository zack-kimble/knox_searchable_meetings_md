| 0:07:21| We met yesterday morning at 730.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=441)|
| 0:07:23| Councilman Holquist and Becker also attended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=443)|
| 0:07:27| And actually, we're going to be doing something that the task force requested later on on the agenda concerning the traffic count issues out in the Fountain City area in this proximity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=447)|
| 0:07:38| There's some other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=458)|
| 0:07:39| We're definitely moving forward, but we're going to get some assistance with TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=459)|
| 0:07:44| Unfortunately, as we all know, government moves slowly and often a lot more slowly than we'd ever hope for or anticipate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=464)|
| 0:07:50| So right now, we're moving forward seeing what possibilities are for improving the situation out there, whether it's widening the road or possibly seeing about a traffic roundabout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=470)|
| 0:08:04| But nevertheless, we're moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=484)|
| 0:08:06| Unfortunately, it just goes a little slow sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=486)|
| 0:08:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=489)|
| 0:08:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=490)|
| 0:08:11| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=491)|

| 0:08:16| This coming Sunday, March 2nd, starting at 1 o'clock, there will be a trail building, volunteer trail building project that mountain bikers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=496)|
| 0:08:28| and people from the Lake Forest Neighborhood Association and anyone else who wants to get involved can at the Hastie Natural Area, the William Hastie Natural Area in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=508)|
| 0:08:40| I think they're going to park people at Iams Nature Center and shuttle them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=520)|
| 0:08:44| Again, that starts at 1 o'clock on Sunday, March 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=524)|
| 0:08:48| So folks to be aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=528)|
| 0:08:50| Also, just another little bit of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=530)|

| 0:09:02| And one of the things that they're going to be considering is whether or not to recommend a TDOT that they explore further the Beltway being a toll highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=542)|
| 0:09:14| So that's gotten a lot of people's attention, so I thought it might be worth putting out there again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=554)|
| 0:09:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=559)|

| 0:09:32| A lot of excitement about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=572)|
| 0:09:35| And I just thought it might be kind of fun to consider Knoxville's ratings and rankings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=575)|
| 0:09:42| So Randy Kenner was kind enough to do a little research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=582)|
| 0:09:46| And I'd just like to make a little report to you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=586)|
| 0:09:49| So in 2005, Knoxville was ranked 18th in Inc. Magazine's Best Places for Doing Business in America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=589)|
| 0:10:00| And it was the only Tennessee city to be listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=600)|
| 0:10:03| In 2005, it was ranked in the top 15 in Forbes Magazine listing of best cities to do business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=603)|
| 0:10:10| 2006, I think these all are years that are going to be interesting to you since they sort of encompass your term in office, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=610)|
| 0:10:19| 2006 ranked fifth in Forbes Magazine listing of top cities for business and careers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=619)|

| 0:11:21| And then in 2007, we ranked fifth in Forbes Magazine's list of top cities for business and careers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=681)|
| 0:11:29| So, is it surprising that on Monday, February the 25th, 2008, we find the University of Tennessee men's basketball team receiving a number one ranking in college basketball?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=689)|

| 0:11:53| We've got to beat Bandy tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=713)|
| 0:11:55| I think city council should take full credit for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=715)|
| 0:11:58| I think so, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=718)|
| 0:11:59| So, I wanted to be sure we got right in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=719)|

| 0:21:02| And I'm just, I'm concerned about the allowing of outdoor display of things for sale on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1262)|
| 0:21:11| property in the future and I didn't know whether there would be any consideration of doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1271)|
| 0:21:16| you know, do we ever do a zoning that is contingent upon this particular use and then it reverts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1276)|
| 0:21:23| back to where it was if that use is suspended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1283)|
| 0:21:31| I don't have an answer for your question, but I have a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1291)|
| 0:21:35| Mr. Donaldson, do you have an answer about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1295)|
| 0:21:38| Do we ever do a conditional kind of, or zoning, rezoning with conditions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1298)|
| 0:21:44| Maybe condition zoning, but never in that manner so that it would revert back to a previous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1304)|
| 0:21:50| zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1310)|
| 0:21:52| That would take another ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1312)|
| 0:21:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1313)|
| 0:21:54| I guess I would be interested if any of my colleagues have, share concerns about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1314)|
| 0:22:00| particular rezoning on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1320)|
| 0:22:02| I'll go to Ms. Pelow first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1322)|
| 0:22:03| Well, I just have a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1323)|
| 0:22:05| It's similar to the comment I made two weeks ago and in the two weeks interim, I've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1325)|
| 0:22:11| absolutely no one contact me about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1331)|
| 0:22:16| The Dean Hill organization has had a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1336)|
| 0:22:21| I did not hear from any of them in regard to this issue and I'm sure they have seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1341)|
| 0:22:25| the signage there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| And then I have heard nothing from, there are two groups that really are kind of protectors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1347)|
| 0:22:34| you might say, of that corridor, Kingston Pike Corridor, and I have heard nothing from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1354)|
| 0:22:39| the group that represents the businesses from North Shore to Paper Mill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1359)|
| 0:22:46| So my assumption had to be that there were no questions and no concerns and that is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1366)|
| 0:22:52| reason that I made the motion to approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| And I think we understood that the use was going to be for plants in the spring months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1375)|
| 0:23:01| and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1381)|
| 0:23:03| And it's not highly unusual for businesses on Kingston Pike to sell plants and for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1383)|
| 0:23:10| to be displayed outside because, of course, Parker Brothers, Ace Hardware does that and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1390)|
| 0:23:15| we've had Oaks Nursery a little further down Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1395)|
| 0:23:18| So I'm just simply reporting that there's been no conversation, no discussion and no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1398)|
| 0:23:23| concerns that have been voiced to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1403)|
| 0:23:27| Mr. Hulquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| Mr. Becker had his light on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| No, I think you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1411)|
| 0:23:32| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1412)|
| 0:23:33| Well, in answer to your question, Councilman Roddy, I share those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1413)|
| 0:23:39| I think that, is the applicant the Humane Society?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1419)|
| 0:23:41| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1421)|
| 0:23:42| Drew McElroy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1422)|
| 0:23:43| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1423)|
| 0:23:46| It sure doesn't look like the applicant's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1426)|
| 0:23:52| I don't believe, he hasn't contacted me and he was not here two weeks ago either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1432)|
| 0:23:59| So, if the applicant hasn't shown up for first or second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1439)|
| 0:24:03| No, he was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1443)|
| 0:24:04| I thought you said he wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1444)|
| 0:24:05| He was here last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1445)|
| 0:24:06| He spoke to us, as a matter of fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1446)|
| 0:24:07| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1447)|
| 0:24:08| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1448)|
| 0:24:09| Okay, I'd forgotten that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1449)|
| 0:24:10| Anyway, I share Councilman Roddy's concerns and flower sales now, used car sales later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1450)|
| 0:24:24| that's the kind of thing that I think I'd be a little reluctant to jump into unless there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1464)|
| 0:24:29| a real strong rationale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1469)|
| 0:24:30| I'd like to wish the applicant were here so we can ask more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1470)|
| 0:24:35| I don't want to deny them necessarily because they're not here, but maybe postpone action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1475)|
| 0:24:43| final action, you know, on second reading until we can get a little more information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1483)|
| 0:24:48| from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1488)|
| 0:24:49| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1489)|
| 0:24:50| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1490)|
| 0:24:52| I guess, Ms. Roddy, I genuinely share your concerns about C4 zones and there are two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1492)|
| 0:24:58| factories in this case that make me feel a little better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1498)|
| 0:25:00| One is, if you recall a couple meetings ago, we requested that this Council made to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1500)|
| 0:25:05| to look at all our commercial zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1505)|
| 0:25:07| And one of the expectations I have coming out of that is a limit on this sort of idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1507)|
| 0:25:13| that you can do whatever in your parking lot in a C4 zone that you want, either some review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1513)|
| 0:25:19| processes or some level of limiting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1519)|
| 0:25:23| So I'd rather expect down the road that things are not going to be, you know, you get a C4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1523)|
| 0:25:29| and you can do a used car sales with a barbed wire fence and horrible lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1529)|
| 0:25:34| I think we're going to limit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1534)|
| 0:25:36| The bigger piece in this is, if you check the map, how small an area in front is actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1536)|
| 0:25:41| being rezoned here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| What we have, I'm not sure how long it is at the deepest, but it looks like the kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1543)|
| 0:25:49| of area that if somebody wanted to sell used cars, they could get two or three in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1549)|
| 0:25:53| which doesn't feel near as much of an issue that this feels like a rezoning to have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1553)|
| 0:26:00| occasional flower sale, the occasional whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1560)|
| 0:26:02| So I'm a little more comfortable, although I generally agree with worry about a C4 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1562)|
| 0:26:08| I'm going to go to Mr. Frost and then I'll come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1568)|
| 0:26:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1571)|
| 0:26:12| A question for Councilman Pilo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1572)|
| 0:26:13| Just basically I'm wanting to clarify the neighborhood organization is aware of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1573)|
| 0:26:18| rezoning, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1578)|
| 0:26:19| Well, the presumption would be that it would be because it was signed, the sign was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1579)|
| 0:26:26| I had no questions, no comments that came before me when it was either before MPC or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1586)|
| 0:26:33| now that it's been before Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1593)|
| 0:26:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1596)|
| 0:26:37| So people have acquiesced to the rezoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| I presume so, and I presume some of them may know what the rezoning is for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1599)|
| 0:26:45| This property is, as Councilman Becker stated, a small property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1605)|
| 0:26:49| And actually, the interesting thing that I think might have prompted this request is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1609)|
| 0:26:55| that it is almost next to the Lutheran Church where there is an annual sale of pumpkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1615)|
| 0:27:02| So I sort of have the feeling that there's a feeling of kinship with, you know, wanting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1622)|
| 0:27:09| to do something of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1629)|
| 0:27:11| I'm very familiar with the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1631)|
| 0:27:13| It was a service station early on and then became a dental office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1633)|
| 0:27:19| That's an interesting transition there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| And then, of course, when the Adopt-a-Pet Center went in there, it became the lovely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1641)|
| 0:27:28| pink building that it is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1648)|
| 0:27:31| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1651)|
| 0:27:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1652)|
| 0:27:33| I was just going to respond that I just feel like the outdoor display of used cars or used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1653)|
| 0:27:39| boats or whatever just is not in keeping with the other zoning along this corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1659)|
| 0:27:44| And I just can't, in good conscience, support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| So I plan to vote against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| I totally respect Mrs. Pelow and her communication with the surrounding neighbors, but I personally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1667)|
| 0:27:53| am just not comfortable with this rezoning, so I plan to vote against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1673)|
| 0:27:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1677)|
| 0:27:58| I see no lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1680)|
| 0:28:01| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1681)|
| 0:28:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1682)|
| 0:28:03| Opposed, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1683)|
| 0:28:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1684)|
| 0:28:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1685)|
| 0:28:06| I heard Roddy and Holquist is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| Did I have that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1688)|
| 0:28:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1689)|

| 0:29:41| really good things came out of it, and I appreciate you coming forward, Terri.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=1781)|

| 0:41:51| park process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2511)|
| 0:41:52| As most of you know, we've got a beautiful skate park now open at Tyson Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2512)|
| 0:41:57| We've got tons of great kids showing up there every day, really enjoying the skate park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2517)|
| 0:42:03| If you want to see a park in use and, well, overuse, go down there on Saturday afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2523)|
| 0:42:10| when the weather is good and you will see hundreds of kids enjoying their sport, really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2530)|

| 0:42:21| skills and some of them might end up being professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2541)|

| 0:43:04| We need an effective way to really treat these individuals who are being a thorn in the side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2584)|
| 0:43:11| of the beautiful Knoxville skate park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2591)|

| 0:43:18| they can work with this ordinance to apply some penalties to these individuals who refuse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2598)|
| 0:43:26| to wear helmets, I think it's a great plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2606)|
| 0:43:30| When people speed on the highways, we don't close the highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2610)|
| 0:43:34| We penalize those individuals who don't go by the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2614)|
| 0:43:38| The few individuals, and it is a very few, by far, most of the individuals skateboarding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2618)|
| 0:43:44| biking, rollerblading, roller skating there, are using the place in a great and safe way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2624)|

| 0:43:57| Occasionally, we're going to have to have a few tickets written, make some examples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2637)|

| 0:44:30| We have sprained ankles on soccer fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2670)|

| 0:44:52| Mr. Hawthorne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2692)|
| 0:44:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2693)|
| 0:44:54| Mr. Walsh left a phone message for me earlier about this and something to do with enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2694)|
| 0:45:00| I couldn't quite interpret the whole message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2700)|
| 0:45:02| He was a little bit hoarse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2702)|
| 0:45:03| But it's only enforceable by the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2703)|
| 0:45:08| Is that correct, Chief?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2708)|
| 0:45:11| That's my understanding, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2713)|
| 0:45:14| So I think I know the interpretation now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| You're going to have to get up and try to talk, Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2716)|
| 0:45:19| Mr. Foster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2719)|
| 0:45:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2720)|
| 0:45:21| I was wanting to thank the law department and Parks and Rec and the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2721)|
| 0:45:26| for responsiveness on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2726)|
| 0:45:28| The first weekend the park was open, Sonny and I went by to grind a rail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2728)|
| 0:45:32| And we were just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2732)|
| 0:45:35| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2735)|
| 0:45:37| With my weight, I'd only been to rail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2737)|
| 0:45:40| But we were truly amazed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2740)|
| 0:45:42| The fellow that Brian mentioned that was out there skating, that fellow can defy physics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2742)|
| 0:45:50| Everybody would scatter when he'd get into the big pool or the big bowl and watch that fellow go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2750)|
| 0:45:57| I've been to skate parks in Atlanta before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2757)|
| 0:46:01| And this person is better than anyone I've seen anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2761)|
| 0:46:05| It was very impressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2765)|
| 0:46:06| And another thing that, you know, Parks and Rec was real responsive with was the park was so heavily used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2766)|
| 0:46:11| we had garbage piling up everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2771)|
| 0:46:13| So that's a good situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2773)|
| 0:46:14| And they helped remedy that by getting more cans out there to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2774)|
| 0:46:18| But people were very respectful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| But we do have some folks that, you know, there's a lot going on out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2780)|
| 0:46:24| and we don't want people to get hurt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| So I appreciate the responsiveness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2786)|
| 0:46:29| Ms. Pillow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2789)|
| 0:46:30| You haven't been out grinding rail either, have you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2790)|
| 0:46:33| I'll tell you what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| I thought that was one of the most remarkable things I'd seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2795)|
| 0:46:38| I told Brian, you know, I went to some of the first task force meetings that Chris held.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2798)|
| 0:46:45| And because I just thought, gee, I don't know about this for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2805)|
| 0:46:49| But I have to say, this is an exciting park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2809)|
| 0:46:53| It has been done absolutely beautifully in every way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2813)|
| 0:46:56| I was so impressed with the people who were involved in seeing to it that it is a great park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2816)|
| 0:47:03| And I think the important thing, as you said, Brian, is to be sure that no one gets hurt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2823)|
| 0:47:08| And I really want to salute, I'd take my husband to see this because I thought it was just so exciting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2828)|
| 0:47:14| and these skaters are just so amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2834)|
| 0:47:17| But when we were there, encountered a very nice young officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2837)|
| 0:47:22| who had been really attending to the park all weekend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2842)|
| 0:47:27| and expressed a lot of concerns about no helmets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2847)|
| 0:47:32| So I just want to thank everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| I really appreciate him bringing it to my attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2854)|
| 0:47:37| And I think I bothered Joe Walsh over the weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2857)|
| 0:47:41| and the officer got the police department involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2861)|
| 0:47:44| I just want to thank him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2864)|
| 0:47:46| We have wonderful young officers who aren't just doing a job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2866)|
| 0:47:50| but they are really caring about the people that they're there to protect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2870)|
| 0:47:54| And I think he had a great deal to do with us not wasting any time before we put something on the books| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2874)|
| 0:48:02| that hopefully will help that enforcement issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2882)|
| 0:48:07| So thank you all for all you do with the department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2887)|
| 0:48:10| and keeping the park safe for everyone to enjoy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2890)|
| 0:48:15| And if you haven't been by there, you know, drive by there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2895)|
| 0:48:19| It's just an amazing site and really exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2899)|
| 0:48:22| These kids are having a great time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2902)|
| 0:48:25| Okay, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2905)|
| 0:48:27| Opposed, no. Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2907)|
| 0:48:29| 12B is an ordinance to amend Ordinance No. 0-155-00,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2909)|
| 0:48:34| granting tonology of Knoxville, Inc., a franchise for the use and occupancy of public ways in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2914)|
| 0:48:39| for the purpose of constructing and operating a cable television system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2919)|
| 0:48:42| and other telecommunications privileges in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2922)|
| 0:48:45| specifically relating to liquidated damages, completion of the cable system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2925)|
| 0:48:48| and providing cable television service to certain facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2928)|
| 0:48:53| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2933)|
| 0:48:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2934)|
| 0:48:55| Okay, Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2935)|
| 0:48:56| I know a gentleman here from knowledge, if they wish to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2936)|
| 0:48:59| Yeah, Mr. I'm going to mess up your last name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2939)|
| 0:49:05| Felix is your first name, but Pachucci, please, if you'd come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2945)|
| 0:49:15| If you'd give us your name and address, and I think Jason Clabo is with you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2955)|
| 0:49:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2959)|
| 0:49:20| Felix Pachucci.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2960)|
| 0:49:21| I'm the Vice President of Regulatory Revenue, Governmental Affairs for Knowledge, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2961)|
| 0:49:28| PO Box 510, West Point, Georgia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2968)|
| 0:49:33| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2973)|
| 0:49:34| Oh, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2974)|
| 0:49:35| We had the pleasure of talking about the knowledge and situation beforehand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2975)|
| 0:49:39| They apparently had heard that I cared about their contract with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2979)|
| 0:49:44| Do you care to explain what, assuming this is passed by council, what is going to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2984)|
| 0:49:51| Well, we negotiated with the city administration to share our success in the marketplace in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2991)|
| 0:49:59| So, as we succeed and grow in Knoxville, we're going to continue to build out the city of Knoxville based on factors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=2999)|
| 0:50:06| so that we can continue to provide competitive broadband services in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3006)|
| 0:50:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3011)|
| 0:50:12| How many, for the public, we discussed this beforehand, how many, once this plan is implemented in 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3012)|
| 0:50:18| how many more homes passed will this result in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3018)|
| 0:50:24| We project in 2008 that we will pass somewhere around between 1,300 and 1,600 new passings in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3024)|
| 0:50:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3034)|
| 0:50:37| At this pace, any idea when the city of Knoxville will be built out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3037)|
| 0:50:41| Your local GM might know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3041)|
| 0:50:43| I'll take that question for the local GM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3043)|
| 0:50:48| The compromise that we reached with the city and Larry Martin is really a compounding effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3048)|
| 0:50:57| So, the more build-out we do in more dense areas, the more revenues are going to accrue to Nology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3057)|
| 0:51:04| as well as to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3064)|
| 0:51:07| So, as a result, it's going to be a compounding effect over the remaining years of the franchise, which expires in April 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3067)|
| 0:51:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3074)|
| 0:51:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3075)|
| 0:51:16| I just want to point out to council, I got from Jim York, since council first took up this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3076)|
| 0:51:22| that Nology has now paid approximately $461,000 in change combined to both the city of Knoxville and to CTV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3082)|
| 0:51:32| I still personally take issue that no one in south Knoxville and no one in east Knoxville is able to get the services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3092)|
| 0:51:43| I mean, the idea behind granting a franchise is that it benefits everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3103)|
| 0:51:49| And there's a, you know, I've looked at maps and I've looked at census tracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3109)|
| 0:51:54| and in my opinion folks are certainly free to disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3114)|
| 0:51:57| There's a dearth of low-income census tracts that are being served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3117)|
| 0:52:02| And I think we need to improve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3122)|
| 0:52:07| I think the dollars that they're putting in, they should be certainly commended for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3127)|
| 0:52:12| and bring in competition for more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3132)|
| 0:52:15| I just certainly wish that folks, you know, out in Holston Hills, Chilhowee Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3135)|
| 0:52:22| Points East and South Haven and Island Home would get the benefit of their services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3142)|
| 0:52:32| Would you like to comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3152)|
| 0:52:34| The comment I would make, Councilman, is most markets that Nology serves in with a competitor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3154)|
| 0:52:41| First, according to the General Accounting Office in Washington, D.C.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3161)|
| 0:52:46| in terms of wireline cable competition, only 2% of cities in the United States have a competitor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3166)|
| 0:52:54| And Knoxville is, we believe, fortunate to have that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3174)|
| 0:52:57| and we enjoy very much working in Knoxville and working with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3177)|
| 0:53:02| But with respect to competition, Knoxville is one of the few cities where we have discriminatory pricing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3182)|
| 0:53:08| For example, if you go to other markets around the southeast which Nology serves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3188)|
| 0:53:12| typically if there's a competitor in the marketplace, price competition accrues to all the customers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3192)|
| 0:53:19| whether or not the particular neighborhoods are built or not built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3199)|
| 0:53:24| So from that perspective, the possibility for competition as Nology continues to build out its network| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3204)|
| 0:53:32| is that the city may want to consider a price discrimination ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3212)|
| 0:53:40| It's the Italian in me in the south trying to speak to all the volunteers here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3220)|
| 0:53:45| But anyways, that would be a solution during the interim period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3225)|
| 0:53:50| that we're getting a competitive plan across the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3230)|
| 0:53:54| You know, I guess in response to that and reference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3234)|
| 0:53:58| someone I worked with went from an area that was served only by Comcast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3238)|
| 0:54:03| to an area served by both Comcast and Nology, and his pricing dropped about $40 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3243)|
| 0:54:10| And that's significant savings for people for comparable service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3250)|
| 0:54:16| You know, with competition, you get choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3256)|
| 0:54:21| Generally speaking, it would be my preference to have better pricing by competition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3261)|
| 0:54:26| rather than rules and regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3266)|
| 0:54:28| particularly when the party that's supposed to be competing signed a contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3268)|
| 0:54:33| that they were going to bring that competition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3273)|
| 0:54:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3275)|
| 0:54:36| Councilman Hopest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3276)|
| 0:54:38| Yes, a question, I guess, for Felix, since you're the one with the microphone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3278)|
| 0:54:42| speaking on behalf of Nology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3282)|
| 0:54:45| I represent, the district I represent is South Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3285)|
| 0:54:48| and also the university campus area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3288)|
| 0:54:51| I am having a hard time believing, based on the information that I've gotten so far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3291)|
| 0:54:56| and you may please eliminate this for me if you can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3296)|
| 0:55:01| but it appears that the constituents that I represent may not ever be able to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3301)|
| 0:55:08| or at least for the foreseeable future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3308)|
| 0:55:10| be able to anticipate this kind of competitive service provided by Nology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3310)|
| 0:55:16| What would your response to what I just said be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3316)|
| 0:55:19| Well, Councilman, I think that's a very, very fair question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3319)|
| 0:55:24| But the compromise that we negotiated with the city administration, in my view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3324)|
| 0:55:32| creates opportunity to build the entire city because it's a compound in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3332)|
| 0:55:36| So as Nology builds more dense areas and creates more revenues for Nology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3336)|
| 0:55:41| which we're going to share with the city of Huntsville, a new build-out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3341)|
| 0:55:46| it will give us the opportunity to continue to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3346)|
| 0:55:50| and continue to make Knoxville a ubiquitous build,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3350)|
| 0:55:56| as originally agreed to in the year 2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3356)|
| 0:56:00| So you believe that is possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3360)|
| 0:56:01| Do you believe that there's any kind of timeline that you can project for the entire city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3361)|
| 0:56:05| I do believe it's possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3365)|
| 0:56:07| but the first thing that happens when we start projecting timelines is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3367)|
| 0:56:11| one, as the funds get off the hook, there's just a lot of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3371)|
| 0:56:15| So we're really not in a position to project a timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3375)|
| 0:56:22| You understand my position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3382)|
| 0:56:23| It's very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3383)|
| 0:56:24| If I think it's going to be 50 years for this to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3384)|
| 0:56:27| then there's no benefit to most of my constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3387)|
| 0:56:32| If it's going to be 10 years or less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3392)|
| 0:56:35| then that's something that they might get a little bit excited about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3395)|
| 0:56:44| I understand completely, Councilman, where you're coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3404)|
| 0:56:48| There's a lot of market dynamics happening right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3408)|
| 0:56:53| For example, we know that AT&T is pushing the legislature in Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3413)|
| 0:56:57| to push AT&T's broadband or their IP video service throughout the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3417)|
| 0:57:05| and they're going to do that through DSL, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3425)|
| 0:57:08| As you well know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3428)|
| 0:57:09| AT&T is one of the big issues they have is they don't want a ubiquitous build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3429)|
| 0:57:14| So they're going around the country and pushing their lobbying might not to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3434)|
| 0:57:21| Whereas from Nology's position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| we're a company that wants to work with the city and compete with the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3443)|
| 0:57:29| despite whatever happens in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3449)|
| 0:57:32| So with that said, we're going to do our best,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3452)|
| 0:57:35| but I don't want to make a commitment tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3455)|
| 0:57:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3458)|
| 0:57:39| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3459)|
| 0:57:40| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3460)|
| 0:57:41| I almost turned that light off because actually my comments have already been made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3461)|
| 0:57:47| I think, by Councilman Frost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3467)|
| 0:57:49| especially by Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3469)|
| 0:57:50| I agree with him wholeheartedly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3470)|
| 0:57:52| One thing that concerns me is I would assume that Nology also does long-term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3472)|
| 0:57:58| and short-term strategic planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3478)|
| 0:58:00| So surely somewhere in the process you are at least having some discussions about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3480)|
| 0:58:05| the possibility of what your long-term or short-term plan will be strategically for growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3485)|
| 0:58:11| But you just said you don't have a timeline, so I'm a little confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3491)|
| 0:58:15| Are you at least having the discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3495)|
| 0:58:17| or going through the planning process of what the potential long-term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3497)|
| 0:58:20| and short-term strategic growth patterns could be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3500)|
| 0:58:23| Councilman, we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3503)|
| 0:58:26| If you look back in 2000 when we negotiated the franchise with the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3506)|
| 0:58:32| basically you could go in, you could take a PowerPoint one-page presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3512)|
| 0:58:36| and come out of the financial markets with $3 billion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3516)|
| 0:58:41| Today it's almost impossible to fund an overbilled or competitive broadband company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3521)|
| 0:58:50| The investors, you can't get banks, you can't get bonds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3530)|
| 0:58:55| and you can't get equity investors to fund it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3535)|
| 0:59:00| So Nology, fortunately, we survived the dot-com boom back in 2000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3540)|
| 0:59:07| one of the few companies that survived it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3547)|
| 0:59:09| and now we're in a free cash flow position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3549)|
| 0:59:11| So in terms of our strategic planning, as we generate more and more cash,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3551)|
| 0:59:15| we're going to do more and more build-out in the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3555)|
| 0:59:18| which goes back to the agreement and the compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3558)|
| 0:59:22| that we reached with the city administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3562)|
| 0:59:26| Because I represent the area that Councilman Frost spoke of earlier that's east,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3566)|
| 0:59:31| the Holster Hills, Chihuly Hills, Five Points, downtown Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3571)|
| 0:59:36| Parks and Mechanicsville, and all those areas could benefit from this competition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3576)|
| 0:59:42| I understand the dynamics of this negotiation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3582)|
| 0:59:46| and a lot of the issues, underpinning issues here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3586)|
| 0:59:49| and have talked with the law department about what our motivation is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3589)|
| 0:59:53| but I am concerned about my district actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3593)|
| 0:59:56| and a lot of part of this town actually being left out of the potential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3596)|
| 1:00:01| at least for the near future, of growth in your involvement in those areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3601)|
| 1:00:05| and that just concerns me at this juncture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3605)|
| 1:00:08| Ms. Bielow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3608)|
| 1:00:10| Well, actually, the shoe is on the other foot in my situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3610)|
| 1:00:16| because I represent the 2nd District or the West Knoxville District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3616)|
| 1:00:20| and that feels extremely uncomfortable to me and has for the last eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3620)|
| 1:00:30| And I think we approached this agreement with a lot of optimism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3630)|
| 1:00:36| And, of course, West Knoxville was your first move into the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3636)|
| 1:00:44| And, actually, we experienced some problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3644)|
| 1:00:49| and had to speak with some of your personnel here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3649)|
| 1:00:52| because we had some tree cutting that was very unscrupulously done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3652)|
| 1:00:57| and all of the debris was left blocking streets and just a lot of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3657)|
| 1:01:04| And, of course, that was mine to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3664)|
| 1:01:07| But my biggest concern is that I represent that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3667)|
| 1:01:11| However, my accountability is to every citizen of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3671)|
| 1:01:17| And, to me, it has been a very frustrating and a very disappointing thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3677)|
| 1:01:22| to see that the entire city has not been given that same regard, you know, by analogy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3682)|
| 1:01:29| So I just personally have a great problem with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3689)|
| 1:01:36| because I really had confidence in your company that they would meet their obligations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3696)|
| 1:01:43| And I personally do not feel that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3703)|
| 1:01:46| And I realize that the business world is out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3706)|
| 1:01:49| and I understand many of the points that you are making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3709)|
| 1:01:52| However, we are responsible for every citizen in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3712)|
| 1:01:57| And I am particularly uncomfortable to be residing in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3717)|
| 1:02:01| and representing a district that has been, I think it's very discriminatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3721)|
| 1:02:07| And I just have to look you right in the eyes and say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3727)|
| 1:02:10| because I'm very uncomfortable with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3730)|
| 1:02:13| and very uncomfortable with agreeing to this compromise that you have reached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3733)|
| 1:02:18| Mr. Foster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3738)|
| 1:02:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3740)|
| 1:02:21| You know, it goes along the lines of the public facilities that are being provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3741)|
| 1:02:25| The new services aren't anywhere other than north and west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3745)|
| 1:02:28| But I kind of acknowledge these defense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3748)|
| 1:02:30| They did start in north Knoxville and in west Knoxville simultaneously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3750)|
| 1:02:35| But I've got Mr. Boccucci.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3755)|
| 1:02:38| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3758)|
| 1:02:39| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| He was referencing the AT&T cable bill in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3761)|
| 1:02:44| I've got from a friend in Nashville part of a working copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3764)|
| 1:02:48| And AT&T, in trying to get this passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3768)|
| 1:02:52| is agreeing to having a certain percentage of their services available to folks in low income areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3772)|
| 1:03:00| Is that something that you all could agree to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3780)|
| 1:03:03| Councilman, we did agree to that in our original franchise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3783)|
| 1:03:08| And if you look at the way we approached our bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3788)|
| 1:03:11| we were approaching all demographics in conjunction with the agreement that we negotiated in the year 2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3791)|
| 1:03:19| But does it – I don't have it right in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3799)|
| 1:03:22| It's a rather thick document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3802)|
| 1:03:24| Does it prescribe the actual percentage of low income housing that you all run your services by?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3804)|
| 1:03:32| I believe – I don't have it in front of me either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3812)|
| 1:03:34| But the original agreement spoke to various geographies within the city and where you were going to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3814)|
| 1:03:44| But I will add from – if you look at the total picture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3824)|
| 1:03:49| Nology's business plan requires all demographics because different demographics buy different products from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3829)|
| 1:03:55| As you well know, we provide the triple play or phone internet and data in the different demographics by different products| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3835)|
| 1:04:03| in order to make our models work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3843)|
| 1:04:06| We typically have to build most and all demographics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3846)|
| 1:04:11| And as I explained to these gentlemen before me, they think I'm beating them up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3851)|
| 1:04:15| but actually I want them to succeed because the better they do, the better it works out for all citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3855)|
| 1:04:20| And part of the agreement, you all are proposing to quarterly provide to the city reports of the status of your build out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3860)|
| 1:04:29| Would you mind doing those on a bi-monthly basis and include the number of new homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3869)|
| 1:04:33| that are residences that you're running by now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3873)|
| 1:04:37| Would you accept that as a friendly amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3877)|
| 1:04:39| We'd be happy to update the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3879)|
| 1:04:43| I may suggest that we could informally meet bi-monthly and then have a quarterly report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3883)|
| 1:04:50| We don't want to get into a very burdensome reporting mechanism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3890)|
| 1:04:57| but we'd be very happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3897)|
| 1:04:59| I think the solution to that may be that we have bi-weekly meetings with updates to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3899)|
| 1:05:07| So bi-monthly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3907)|
| 1:05:08| Or bi-monthly, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3908)|
| 1:05:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3909)|
| 1:05:10| I don't know how other folks feel about this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3910)|
| 1:05:14| Assuming it passes tonight, it will be up for a second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3914)|
| 1:05:17| so folks in the meantime might be thinking about questions between now and the first meeting next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3917)|
| 1:05:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3925)|
| 1:05:26| Mr. Holquist, is that a new light or an old light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3926)|
| 1:05:29| It's a new light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3929)|
| 1:05:30| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3930)|
| 1:05:31| Well, if there are going to be quarterly reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3931)|
| 1:05:34| and they're going to do informal meetings to give updates in between,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3934)|
| 1:05:39| then perhaps you could do one sort of right in between each quarterly meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3939)|
| 1:05:44| so that wouldn't work out to be, that would be roughly bi-monthly, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3944)|
| 1:05:48| but just schedule it in, you know, whatever that works out to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3948)|
| 1:05:52| We do have one person sign up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3952)|
| 1:05:54| Mr. Alonzo Montgomery has signed up to speak on this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3954)|
| 1:05:57| so we'll let him come to the podium now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3957)|
| 1:05:59| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3959)|
| 1:06:02| Thank you very much, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3962)|
| 1:06:05| Alonzo Montgomery, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3965)|
| 1:06:08| Mr. Mayor, I came two weeks ago for your council, and I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3968)|
| 1:06:13| East Knoxville with your legacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3973)|
| 1:06:15| Now, that was on that Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3975)|
| 1:06:17| That Friday, you was on WHAE talking about Magnolia with Teresa Smith, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3977)|
| 1:06:23| because what we talked about that Tuesday caught the eye of all of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3983)|
| 1:06:28| that, you know, we're being left behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3988)|
| 1:06:31| Knowledge, what they just gave to you all this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3991)|
| 1:06:34| and I have no disrespect to these gentlemen, if y'all prove this, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3994)|
| 1:06:39| that's why I say dirty hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=3999)|
| 1:06:41| I didn't mean to Dr. Lyons that he had dirty hands by taking money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4001)|
| 1:06:46| but they're doing East Knoxville, your main man, they're doing us injustice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4006)|
| 1:06:55| I've read everything, all the resolutions concerning knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4015)|
| 1:07:00| not only the city side but the county side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4020)|
| 1:07:03| and I watched these guys in 2005 come back before the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4023)|
| 1:07:08| and they gave them the same baloney that they're giving you all tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4028)|
| 1:07:12| Oh, we're going to be able to go throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4032)|
| 1:07:16| We're going to have Vice Mayor Brown, they said, we're going to have this thing done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4036)|
| 1:07:21| It's 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4041)|
| 1:07:23| Now, Dr. Lyons talking about not penalizing these guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4043)|
| 1:07:29| Every time that it's time for these folks to get penalized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4049)|
| 1:07:32| y'all give them a flying saucer to let them get by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4052)|
| 1:07:37| Knowledge has disappointed Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4057)|
| 1:07:41| I live out West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4061)|
| 1:07:42| I'll tell you where I live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4062)|
| 1:07:44| I sit there and watch knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4064)|
| 1:07:46| Knowledge, those jokers, they cherry pick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4066)|
| 1:07:50| They cherry pick, Councilman Woodall, what they were going to do in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4070)|
| 1:07:55| They went out West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4075)|
| 1:07:57| They didn't do nothing but hang around out West,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4077)|
| 1:07:59| and then all of a sudden they finally made it out near Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4079)|
| 1:08:04| They never went nowhere else, Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4084)|
| 1:08:07| But now they're back here again, and the people, you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4087)|
| 1:08:11| When they came here in 2000, their agreement was, Mr. Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4091)|
| 1:08:14| that they were going to provide services for every citizen in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4094)|
| 1:08:19| When I go to East Knoxville to my family's house, they can use that cable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4099)|
| 1:08:24| because their cable, they're very competitive with Comcast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4104)|
| 1:08:28| One of these things called low rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4108)|
| 1:08:31| It's a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4111)|
| 1:08:33| It's a flat-out lie, because their rates, their services are just as high as Comcast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4113)|
| 1:08:39| So what service are they doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4119)|
| 1:08:43| I commend you, Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4123)|
| 1:08:45| You don't want in the paper, and I got the article here, that they ain't going to take a stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4125)|
| 1:08:51| But the rest of you all are going to sit there and approve them tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4131)|
| 1:08:54| so they can continue to cherry pick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4134)|
| 1:08:57| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4137)|
| 1:08:58| I think knowledge needs to be packing up and go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4138)|
| 1:09:01| Now, y'all may say, Alonzo, you got a tear of motive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4141)|
| 1:09:04| Mr. Mayor, I'm just going to be a couple more minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4144)|
| 1:09:07| You got one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4147)|
| 1:09:08| Come on, give me a couple more minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4148)|
| 1:09:10| One more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4150)|
| 1:09:11| This is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4151)|
| 1:09:12| John's mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4152)|
| 1:09:13| Your buddies come up here, you give them all night, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4153)|
| 1:09:15| When something's important, it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4155)|
| 1:09:19| Am I right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4159)|
| 1:09:21| I think y'all prejudice towards me and bias.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4161)|
| 1:09:24| But y'all can be that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4164)|
| 1:09:25| I don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4165)|
| 1:09:27| But I'm telling you right now, y'all approve this for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4167)|
| 1:09:30| Y'all doing the citizens of Knoxville injustice, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4170)|
| 1:09:34| And you're supposed to be for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4174)|
| 1:09:37| Unlike Ms. Pelo, she's for her district, but she represents every citizen in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4177)|
| 1:09:42| These jokers have failed, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4182)|
| 1:09:45| And if y'all let these guys go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4185)|
| 1:09:47| You know, y'all talking about jobs now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4187)|
| 1:09:49| Heck, y'all giving $400,000 of taxpayers' money to jobs now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4189)|
| 1:09:53| $450,000 to jobs now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4193)|
| 1:09:57| What y'all going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4197)|
| 1:09:58| Go to your next meeting and say, oh, man, we got knowledge here on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4198)|
| 1:10:03| You know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4203)|
| 1:10:04| It's all about numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4204)|
| 1:10:05| It's not about people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4205)|
| 1:10:07| You know, but these guys here, I don't care where they come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4207)|
| 1:10:10| They fail, Catherine Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4210)|
| 1:10:12| They fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4212)|
| 1:10:13| And if y'all let these jokers keep doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4213)|
| 1:10:15| You know how long it's going to take them to get to East Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4215)|
| 1:10:18| That's why they wouldn't give you a guarantee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4218)|
| 1:10:20| It's going to take them another 10 or 12 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4220)|
| 1:10:23| And another two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4223)|
| 1:10:24| I don't care if they bring y'all a report every other month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4224)|
| 1:10:28| I don't care what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4228)|
| 1:10:30| They're not going to meet their mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4230)|
| 1:10:33| Because they fail the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4233)|
| 1:10:34| Because they said in 2000, they said they'll have it finished by 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4234)|
| 1:10:40| Where are they at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4240)|
| 1:10:41| They filled out West Knoxville and Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4241)|
| 1:10:44| And now y'all going to sit here on first reading and approve these guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4244)|
| 1:10:49| Because Dr. Lyons never said it's cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4249)|
| 1:10:52| What about that woman that liked to have cable sitting over in that shotgun house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4252)|
| 1:10:58| And can't afford it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4258)|
| 1:11:00| And these jokers, and I'm finished now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4260)|
| 1:11:02| And these jokers come up here and talk about AT&T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4262)|
| 1:11:05| Eight years later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4265)|
| 1:11:06| AT&T only started talking about they want it this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4266)|
| 1:11:10| Yeah, they in Nashville lobbying trying to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4270)|
| 1:11:13| Because these guys fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4273)|
| 1:11:14| Somebody's got to do it, Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4274)|
| 1:11:17| Direct TV came to town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4277)|
| 1:11:19| Man, ain't throwing that thing going to sound like this stuff all over this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4279)|
| 1:11:24| These guys fail, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4284)|
| 1:11:26| And I'm asking y'all tonight, don't approve these jokers on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4286)|
| 1:11:30| Let them prove themselves before y'all give them a bye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4290)|
| 1:11:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4293)|
| 1:11:35| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4295)|
| 1:11:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4298)|
| 1:11:39| I was just going to say to Mr. Montgomery, just because, you know, this is two readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4299)|
| 1:11:42| Other folks on Council may vote one way one week for the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4302)|
| 1:11:46| You may vote another way for the second reading after they look at it more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4306)|
| 1:11:49| I don't mean to speak for any other person, but just because you vote, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4309)|
| 1:11:54| things have passed on first reading that have failed on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4314)|
| 1:11:57| I understand that, Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4317)|
| 1:11:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4318)|
| 1:11:59| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4319)|
| 1:12:00| It's not your turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4320)|
| 1:12:02| Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4322)|
| 1:12:03| Well, thank you, Councilman Frost, because I was getting ready to say the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4323)|
| 1:12:09| I'm really not very comfortable with this yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4329)|
| 1:12:13| Like Councilman Pelos said, it's not right for a lot of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4333)|
| 1:12:17| There are problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4337)|
| 1:12:18| But I think it's, I'm willing to vote for it on first reading and then perhaps have a chance to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4338)|
| 1:12:24| Hopefully, he'll hear from the analogy representatives between now and second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4344)|
| 1:12:30| I'd like to hear from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4350)|
| 1:12:31| They haven't contacted me yet, but I would like to hear from them between now and second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4351)|
| 1:12:37| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4357)|
| 1:12:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4359)|

| 1:12:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4368)|
| 1:12:49| I heard two noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4369)|
| 1:12:50| Were there any others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4370)|
| 1:12:52| Three noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4372)|
| 1:12:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4373)|
| 1:12:54| I heard six yeses and three noes from Vice Mayor Brown, Ms. Pelos, and Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4374)|
| 1:12:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4378)|
| 1:12:59| Approved on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4379)|

| 1:13:21| What can you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4401)|
| 1:13:23| Why was this cul-de-sac built in the first place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4403)|
| 1:13:25| Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4405)|
| 1:13:27| Actually, the cul-de-sac wasn't built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4407)|
| 1:13:29| The right-of-way for the cul-de-sac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4409)|
| 1:13:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4411)|
| 1:13:32| There's no pavement there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4412)|
| 1:13:33| The right-of-way is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4413)|
| 1:13:34| We're closing the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4414)|
| 1:13:36| It was in anticipation, obviously, of some additional development around there or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4416)|
| 1:13:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4420)|
| 1:13:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4421)|
| 1:13:42| Actually, I would just say there's some really exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4422)|
| 1:13:46| I realize it's across the road and in third district rather than second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4426)|
| 1:13:50| but it is just so exciting what is happening at Dowell Springs right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4430)|
| 1:13:54| and some great opportunities for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4434)|
| 1:13:57| So I think taking this action tonight would be great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4437)|
| 1:14:02| because it will enable them to complete that development that's just about to occur there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4442)|
| 1:14:09| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4449)|
| 1:14:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4450)|
| 1:14:11| Mr. King, I know I had a conversation with you, could have been today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4451)|
| 1:14:14| could have been last week, about making sure that this was clear on the engineering conditions on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4454)|
| 1:14:25| The way Section 1 reads is Floyd Smith's conditions are actually referenced in an exhibit here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4465)|
| 1:14:32| and it says clearly that the developer has to meet those conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4472)|
| 1:14:37| Does that feel good for engineering, or would you like something more concrete on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4477)|
| 1:14:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4482)|
| 1:14:43| I think the law department has worked that out to our satisfaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4483)|
| 1:14:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4485)|
| 1:14:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4486)|
| 1:14:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4487)|
| 1:14:48| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4488)|
| 1:14:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4489)|
| 1:14:50| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4490)|
| 1:14:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4491)|
| 1:14:52| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4492)|
| 1:14:53| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4493)|
| 1:14:54| 12D is an ordinance approving the request of Paula H. Allen for a one-year plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4494)|
| 1:14:58| from low-density residential to office for property located on the northwest side of Tazewell Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4498)|
| 1:15:02| southwest of Fieldcrest Lane, 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4502)|
| 1:15:06| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4506)|
| 1:15:11| Has anybody signed up on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4511)|
| 1:15:14| No, I have no one signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4514)|
| 1:15:16| I do see someone here who wants to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4516)|
| 1:15:18| Right now I have a motion, but not a second, just for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4518)|
| 1:15:21| So, right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4521)|
| 1:15:22| I mean, I would actually like to hear from people about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4522)|
| 1:15:27| The applicant is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4527)|
| 1:15:30| Just for the record, I don't have a second, just so everybody knows that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4530)|
| 1:15:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4534)|
| 1:15:35| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4535)|
| 1:15:36| Sir, if you would give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4536)|
| 1:15:39| My name is Holland Rowe, 4215 Tazewell Pike, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4539)|
| 1:15:43| I'm here on behalf of Fountain City Town Hall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4543)|
| 1:15:46| and the Tazewell Pike-Beverly Station Neighborhood Coalition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4546)|
| 1:15:51| I want to read a couple of letters to the Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4551)|
| 1:15:55| The first one is from Mark Campin, President or the Chairman of Fountain City Town Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4555)|
| 1:16:01| Dear Council Members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4561)|
| 1:16:03| Fountain City Town Hall is requesting the denial of the proposed one-year plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4563)|
| 1:16:08| and rezoning for the property, tax ID number 58LD02801,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4568)|
| 1:16:14| on the northwest side of Tazewell Pike, southwest of Fieldcrest Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4574)|
| 1:16:19| If these kinds of requests are allowed, it sets a bad precedent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4579)|
| 1:16:23| and makes it difficult for neighbors to work with developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4583)|
| 1:16:26| because they do not know where the zoning changes will end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4586)|
| 1:16:29| as properties are rezoned against the established one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4589)|
| 1:16:33| Fountain City Town Hall Board Member, Charlotte Davis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4593)|
| 1:16:36| said it best at the January 10, 2008, MPC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4596)|
| 1:16:41| When the one-year plan update meeting was held in 2005,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4601)|
| 1:16:44| staff proposed an amendment to change from medium-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4604)|
| 1:16:48| to medium-density office for an area northwest and the south side of Tazewell Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4608)|
| 1:16:54| and northeast of Jacksboro Pike, southwest of the cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4614)|
| 1:16:59| Those in attendance asked that it not be done because there were still several viable houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4619)|
| 1:17:06| It would have made it easier to go from medium-density office to commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4626)|
| 1:17:11| As a result of these concerns, this change in the one-year plan was taken off the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4631)|
| 1:17:17| This is not southwest of the cemetery but directly across from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4637)|
| 1:17:21| There are still two houses being used as residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4641)|
| 1:17:24| We're concerned about the disregard for the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4644)|
| 1:17:28| The property at the corner of Fieldcrest and Tazewell Pike might ask for commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4648)|
| 1:17:32| since the one-year plan is being disregarded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4652)|
| 1:17:35| In January 2007, MPC denied a request from owners south of the property in question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4655)|
| 1:17:42| to be rezoned from medium-density residential to Office 01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4662)|
| 1:17:46| It appears that the property in question is already being used as an office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4666)|
| 1:17:51| Should the owners of the property be rewarded for disregarding the current zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4671)|
| 1:17:56| Fountain City Town Hall doesn't doubt the intentions of the property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4676)|
| 1:18:00| in their plans to make the property more aesthetically pleasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4680)|
| 1:18:03| They have proven this with other residential remodeling jobs in the Fountain City area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4683)|
| 1:18:08| But we have to respectfully request that the City Council deny the one-year plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4688)|
| 1:18:13| and rezoning for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4693)|
| 1:18:15| Thank you, Mark Campin, Chairman of Fountain City Town Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4695)|
| 1:18:19| The other letters from Tazewell Pike-Berkeley Station Neighborhood Coalition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4699)|
| 1:18:26| Our neighborhood, Tazewell Pike-Berkeley Station Neighborhood Coalition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4706)|
| 1:18:31| requests that the Council deny the proposed one-year amendment and rezoning for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4711)|
| 1:18:37| Our neighborhood has tried to be a good neighbor and, over the past years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4717)|
| 1:18:41| has agreed to two rezonings of office in the same block as this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4721)|
| 1:18:46| These properties were in need of repair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4726)|
| 1:18:48| so the neighbors agreed to the office rezoning as the developer requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4728)|
| 1:18:53| At the one-year plan meeting, several other nearby properties were designated for office zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4733)|
| 1:19:00| Ken Pruitt of MPC was advised by several residents of concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4740)|
| 1:19:04| about the office zoning designation of these properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4744)|
| 1:19:07| and how it would encroach upon the residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4747)|
| 1:19:11| We thought during the discussion at that meeting that the plan was changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4751)|
| 1:19:14| and the line was drawn as to where the office would end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4754)|
| 1:19:17| One more minute, Mr. Rowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4757)|
| 1:19:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4759)|
| 1:19:20| Now, yet another property is seeking rezoning and a one-year amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4760)|
| 1:19:25| If Council continues to approve rezonings to office on property-by-property basis without having a boundary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4765)|
| 1:19:30| soon the residential neighbors will be crowded out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4770)|
| 1:19:33| and the domino effect will continue on down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4773)|
| 1:19:36| This type of decision made by Council makes it increasingly difficult for neighbors to work with developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4776)|
| 1:19:43| because we do not know where the effect will end if we allow even one property to be rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4783)|
| 1:19:48| Thank you for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4788)|
| 1:19:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4790)|
| 1:19:51| Just for Council's note, thank you, Mr. Rowe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4791)|
| 1:19:55| we didn't go to those in favor and those against because there's not a motion on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4795)|
| 1:19:58| so there was someone else who wanted to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4798)|
| 1:20:00| Would you like to hear from her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4800)|
| 1:20:03| I think the applicant maybe is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4803)|
| 1:20:04| We'll hear from her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4804)|
| 1:20:05| Oh, yes, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4805)|
| 1:20:06| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4806)|
| 1:20:07| Could you give me the dates on when the City Council voted on those zonings that you just referred to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4807)|
| 1:20:14| Do you have those dates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4814)|
| 1:20:16| No, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4816)|
| 1:20:19| And I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4819)|
| 1:20:20| I talked to Mr. Donaldson earlier, and he didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4820)|
| 1:20:24| I know you have a record of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4824)|
| 1:20:25| But I'm just curious of which councils, what the dates were, and some of those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4825)|
| 1:20:30| This actually was a letter that we had read into the record for the MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4830)|
| 1:20:35| but we wanted to share our feelings with the City Council, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4835)|
| 1:20:39| So I would say probably the City Council hasn't voted on it, but the MPC had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4839)|
| 1:20:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4848)|
| 1:20:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4849)|
| 1:20:50| If you'd give us your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4850)|
| 1:20:51| Just to remind the Council, we're not under our normal floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4851)|
| 1:20:53| and, again, we're just hearing from folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4853)|
| 1:20:55| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4855)|
| 1:20:56| If you'd give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4856)|
| 1:20:57| Paula Allen, 5703 Villa Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4857)|
| 1:21:01| This is my third time here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4861)|
| 1:21:02| I haven't read a statement before, but I think it's probably time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4862)|
| 1:21:07| so I'd like to actually read something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4867)|
| 1:21:10| I keep hearing that I'm being rewarded for doing something wrong by having my office on Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4870)|
| 1:21:15| I would like to stress again that I did not know that what I was doing was wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4875)|
| 1:21:19| and for that I do apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4879)|
| 1:21:21| I am a Tennessee-certified minority-owned business owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4881)|
| 1:21:25| I have run two successful businesses in Knoxville in 13 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4885)|
| 1:21:29| that have generated millions of dollars in revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4889)|
| 1:21:33| most of which I have invested in Knoxville and, more importantly, within Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4893)|
| 1:21:38| I did not know that there was a meeting that was determining the fate of my office years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4898)|
| 1:21:43| and I would certainly have been in attendance had I known that that meeting was occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4903)|
| 1:21:47| I still don't understand the rezoning that the residential versus office boundary should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4907)|
| 1:21:52| between two properties in the middle of one block,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4912)|
| 1:21:55| especially when one of those properties is a two-story salon and spa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4915)|
| 1:22:00| MPC determined that the natural boundary should be a street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4920)|
| 1:22:03| and in this case the street is Fieldcrest, which is to my left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4923)|
| 1:22:09| Both my residential neighbors have seen the plans of the renovations my husband and I are wanting to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4929)|
| 1:22:14| to the property and approve both the rezoning and the renovations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4934)|
| 1:22:17| and I have letters to that effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4937)|
| 1:22:20| The point was made that my husband and I can still spend $40,000 doing these renovations without the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4940)|
| 1:22:26| but economically that makes no sense as this house is literally on top of Panache.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4946)|
| 1:22:32| So to put that money into it as a residence is throwing bad money at bad money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4952)|
| 1:22:39| If I am unable to obtain an Office 1 zoning, I will be forced to locate another office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4959)|
| 1:22:43| and either sell or rent this property as a residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4963)|
| 1:22:46| I do not feel that based on its proximity to Panache that we could attract a suitable tenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4966)|
| 1:22:51| There is virtually no front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4971)|
| 1:22:53| The backyard is 25 feet deep with a drainage ditch cutting through the middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4973)|
| 1:22:58| and since Panache Salon and Spa expanded their back parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4978)|
| 1:23:01| it is literally 17 feet from my foundation of my office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4981)|
| 1:23:07| As I type this, there are 40 parking spaces literally in the backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4987)|
| 1:23:13| As I typed this today, there were 23 cars in that 40 parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4993)|
| 1:23:17| As you can see, this would not be attractive for a suitable tenant or appropriate for residential use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=4997)|
| 1:23:23| All of this is in addition to the fact that Panache Salon and Spa cut down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5003)|
| 1:23:26| and removed three 80-year-old trees, which everybody thinks I cut down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5006)|
| 1:23:30| I did not cut down the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5010)|
| 1:23:31| I planted 40 trees and intend to plant mature trees where the mature trees were taken out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5011)|
| 1:23:38| Without those trees, it is even more apparent that my property aesthetically flows with the salon next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5018)|
| 1:23:44| With those trees gone, there is now absolutely no shade protecting my property in the summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5024)|
| 1:23:49| further reducing the property as residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5029)|
| 1:23:53| I have heard from several individuals that the big concern is not what I want to do with the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5033)|
| 1:23:57| but what someone would do in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5037)|
| 1:24:00| My understanding, Office 1 is the most restrictive zoning you can possibly get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5040)|
| 1:24:05| Ultimately, it is up to you to decide if someone in the future can put a Walmart there or a Super Panache Salon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5045)|
| 1:24:13| In closing, I would like to thank all those that took the time to come out to see the actual lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5053)|
| 1:24:20| because when you see it, you're like, whoa, to return my phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5060)|
| 1:24:24| I'm just asking to be rezoned Office 1 so that Troy and I can spend the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5064)|
| 1:24:29| Again, my husband is a licensed Tennessee contractor to make the improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5069)|
| 1:24:37| to make this more in line with the historic Tazewell Pike property or district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5077)|
| 1:24:43| which the sign is right there in front of my office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5083)|
| 1:24:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5088)|
| 1:24:49| Do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5089)|
| 1:24:50| Ms. Peel, do you have a question or just a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5090)|
| 1:24:54| I have a comment, and I was going to make a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5094)|
| 1:24:56| but I think this is in Councilman Frost's district and I'd like to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5096)|
| 1:24:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5099)|
| 1:25:00| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5100)|
| 1:25:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5101)|
| 1:25:02| Folks will certainly recall this was postponed from last meeting to allow Councilmember Bailey to go out and look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5102)|
| 1:25:08| Since that time, she didn't recall the individual from Fountain City Town Hall that said that apparently this was okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5108)|
| 1:25:16| I think that's been clarified this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5116)|
| 1:25:18| All of Council got emailed a letter from Mark Camp and the chair of Fountain City Town Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5118)|
| 1:25:25| You know, this is important to Town Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5125)|
| 1:25:26| This is important to Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5126)|
| 1:25:29| The folks who were here earlier in the evening that live out in Sherwood Forest, Ridgecrest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5129)|
| 1:25:34| and Castle Heights and other areas that were approved, they stuck around because this issue is important to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5134)|
| 1:25:41| They've been good members of Fountain City Town Hall not just for years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5141)|
| 1:25:45| but in decades and probably a half century or two for some of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5145)|
| 1:25:51| You know, I won't go into what I said at the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5151)|
| 1:25:54| You know, I'll incorporate it by reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5154)|
| 1:25:57| But this gets into, you know, what has happened before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5157)|
| 1:26:01| The line was drawn before in a public meeting, through a public process, through one meeting at MPC, two meetings at City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5161)|
| 1:26:11| When MPC, something appears on their agenda, and Mr. Donaldson can correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5171)|
| 1:26:17| notice is sent out to not just the adjoining property owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5177)|
| 1:26:21| but to property owners not necessarily adjoining but right in the immediate vicinity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5181)|
| 1:26:25| Isn't that correct, Mr. Donaldson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5185)|
| 1:26:27| Any property within 200 feet will get a notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5187)|
| 1:26:31| So this property I would submit is adjoining and would have received that notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5191)|
| 1:26:39| When Ms. Allen and I talked about this over the phone and I went back out and drove the area over the weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5199)|
| 1:26:45| Fieldcrest is a nice little residential street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5205)|
| 1:26:49| You know, this is true that you could call this the last block or last house on this block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5209)|
| 1:26:55| It is the last house on this block that fronts Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5215)|
| 1:27:00| It adjoins a house which is actually on the corner of Tazewell Pike and Fieldcrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5220)|
| 1:27:06| My concern is that this creates the creep into the residential neighborhoods that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5226)|
| 1:27:12| this council hasn't always gone along with the past and for very good reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5232)|
| 1:27:16| whether it was a CPA located on a corner in the second district or, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5236)|
| 1:27:21| other issues out in the third district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5241)|
| 1:27:24| This is something that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5244)|
| 1:27:26| this council has always been supportive of good zoning, supportive of good neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5246)|
| 1:27:32| and I'll move to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5252)|
| 1:27:35| I did not receive that notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5255)|
| 1:27:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5257)|
| 1:27:39| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5259)|
| 1:27:40| We do have rules here we need to follow, so sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5260)|
| 1:27:43| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5263)|
| 1:27:44| So we had a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5264)|
| 1:27:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5266)|
| 1:27:47| Is there discussion on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5267)|
| 1:27:50| Mayor, I'd just like to, I really wanted to just get a little history on, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5270)|
| 1:27:56| Councilman Frost, you talk about it continues to move along Tazewell Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5276)|
| 1:28:02| and I'm just wondering when that happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5282)|
| 1:28:05| and what the circumstances were to allow one more house because as you go, I guess, south or west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5285)|
| 1:28:13| I thought it was west, maybe this south, all those former houses are now businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5293)|
| 1:28:19| And as she said, that Panache, I guess, is the name of the hairdresser place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5299)|
| 1:28:23| has a big parking lot in the backyard and a parking lot on the side and the front and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5303)|
| 1:28:28| And I just thought that this is sort of consistent down Tazewell Pike, and, you know, why would you, as she said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5308)|
| 1:28:36| why would you draw the line between her house and Panache?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5316)|
| 1:28:39| And I think, I thought that the natural barrier would be at the end of her house before you get to the neighborhood field crest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5319)|
| 1:28:47| And I think that is sort of the way I looked at it, the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5327)|
| 1:28:52| And I've never voted for commercial creep, and I'm not for commercial creep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5332)|
| 1:28:57| and neighborhoods are neighborhoods and businesses ought to be in, you know, areas where it's zoned for business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5337)|
| 1:29:03| But I'm not even sure if this is a word, but it appeared to me it's already crept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5343)|
| 1:29:08| I mean, it's already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5348)|
| 1:29:11| And now I'm not, I mean, I'm just from an observation standpoint, I'm just curious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5351)|
| 1:29:19| how did it continue along Tazewell Pike and when did it go along?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5359)|
| 1:29:26| And then again, well, I'll just leave it there, if you could answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5366)|
| 1:29:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5371)|
| 1:29:32| Honestly, I don't recall if this happened before or after you were elected to city council with three other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5372)|
| 1:29:38| But this council, you know, MPC and Fountain City Town Hall had a meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5378)|
| 1:29:45| and it discussed about the rezoning from residential to the Panache salon and an adjoining property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5385)|
| 1:29:55| And at the time, there was, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5395)|
| 1:29:57| Fountain City Town Hall has a positive history of supporting good developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5397)|
| 1:30:03| and likewise opposing bad developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5403)|
| 1:30:05| I mean, they're, you know, as far as neighborhood organizations go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5405)|
| 1:30:11| they do an admirable job in trying to work something out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5411)|
| 1:30:14| And part of that compromise that was done a number of years ago was this was the last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5414)|
| 1:30:22| And, you know, Fountain City Town Hall and this council, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5422)|
| 1:30:27| reasonably took that under consideration and passed that zoning again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5427)|
| 1:30:33| And it's just, you know, it's just something that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5433)|
| 1:30:37| once this gets done in four years or six years when I'm gone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5437)|
| 1:30:43| then it could potentially allow the person on the corner of Tazewell Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5443)|
| 1:30:47| and Fieldcrest to come back and say, well, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5447)|
| 1:30:51| this will just take it to the corner of Fieldcrest and Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5451)|
| 1:30:54| What's one more? What's one more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5454)|
| 1:30:57| And then we start chipping away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5457)|
| 1:30:59| You know, Fieldcrest is probably about 12, 14 homes on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5459)|
| 1:31:03| Nice, modest, middle-class housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5463)|
| 1:31:07| In my opinion, continuing this, backing it up towards the backyards on Fieldcrest harms that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5467)|
| 1:31:17| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5477)|
| 1:31:20| To follow up on Councilman Bailey's question, Mr. Donaldson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5480)|
| 1:31:24| you don't have in front of you the sector plan or the one-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5484)|
| 1:31:29| and when it was last updated in terms of the dates that these discussions took place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5489)|
| 1:31:34| where, you know, it was posted that those discussions were happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5494)|
| 1:31:39| The one-year plan is updated every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5499)|
| 1:31:41| so that discussion could have taken place any one of the years in recent history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5501)|
| 1:31:50| I don't have a record of the particular zoning cases or plan amendments here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5510)|
| 1:31:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5516)|
| 1:31:57| I guess I agree with Councilman Bailey that this is a terribly unfortunate situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5517)|
| 1:32:03| because I was out there today and looked at the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5523)|
| 1:32:06| Ms. Fallon was not there when I stopped by, but it's done corrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5526)|
| 1:32:13| I mean, you know, it's down the way already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5533)|
| 1:32:17| but that doesn't necessarily make one more right, as Councilman Frost said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5537)|
| 1:32:22| It's just, you know, it's unfortunate, and we try to use office as a transitional zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5542)|
| 1:32:28| and I think it's unfortunate that the salon next door was allowed to do what it has done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5548)|
| 1:32:35| with the large parking lot and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5555)|
| 1:32:37| because that parking lot is adjacent to some of these homes on Fieldcrest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5557)|
| 1:32:41| as Fieldcrest bends around to the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5561)|
| 1:32:44| But all that being said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5564)|
| 1:32:46| I have a tremendous amount of respect for the planning process that we utilized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5566)|
| 1:32:50| and it's my understanding that through that planning process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5570)|
| 1:32:54| it was made well known to everyone that participated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5574)|
| 1:32:57| that this was going to be the end of the office transition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5577)|
| 1:33:01| and we were going to go into residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5581)|
| 1:33:04| And so because of my respect for the planning process, I cannot support this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5584)|
| 1:33:09| Mr. Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5589)|
| 1:33:11| Yeah, I guess two things, Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5591)|
| 1:33:13| The sector plan, where this was all done, it doesn't actually have the specific date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5593)|
| 1:33:19| but it's June 2007 when this was adopted, or printed, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5599)|
| 1:33:23| so it would have been adopted after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5603)|
| 1:33:25| So this is not eight months ago that there was a conscious decision not to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5605)|
| 1:33:30| And interestingly, I'm always amazed when I pull these out that looking at the map on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5610)|
| 1:33:35| I actually don't see any of the sector plan doesn't indicate any office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5615)|
| 1:33:40| on what I would call the north side of Taspel Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5620)|
| 1:33:43| which is a little different from what I've been led to believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5623)|
| 1:33:47| The way I look at this, it's medium-density residential from the other side of this house down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5627)|
| 1:33:54| and then low-density residential going the other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5634)|
| 1:33:57| So I think things even were zoned lower than I had thought on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5637)|
| 1:34:04| So it was last summer when all this discussion happened to not rezone this office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5644)|
| 1:34:10| Mayor, I'm not going to belabor this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5650)|
| 1:34:11| but I do like to step up and try to represent people's positions and their arguments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5651)|
| 1:34:19| and then to look at common sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5659)|
| 1:34:22| And, of course, we pay NPC a lot of money to make recommendations to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5662)|
| 1:34:27| And I always go to the staff recommendation because that's not political.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5667)|
| 1:34:31| It's not the NPC commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5671)|
| 1:34:33| It's not the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5673)|
| 1:34:35| It's professional planners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5675)|
| 1:34:37| And it says extension of office into this site is consistent with the surrounding development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5677)|
| 1:34:43| that includes an adjacent beauty parlor and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5683)|
| 1:34:46| And then I just want to further say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5686)|
| 1:34:49| When I look at commercial creep, I also look at the adverse impact that it's going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5689)|
| 1:34:54| on the adjacent neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5694)|
| 1:34:56| And is it going to decrease the quality of life or is it going to decrease the integrity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5696)|
| 1:35:03| or is it going to hurt a neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5703)|
| 1:35:07| And I don't know, you know, if you rezone this and down the road it's sold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5707)|
| 1:35:12| that potentially you'd have other types of things come in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5712)|
| 1:35:16| and you might have UPS trucks or an ambulance or, you know, frequent visitors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5716)|
| 1:35:21| and then you do sort of change the character of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5721)|
| 1:35:24| And I looked at her business and the two cars that were out front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5724)|
| 1:35:28| and I just looked at the business and I looked at the natural business down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5728)|
| 1:35:34| and I felt like it was worth speaking up for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5734)|
| 1:35:37| And I would like to ask the NPC, Mark, one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5737)|
| 1:35:40| How can you have that decision made back in June| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5740)|
| 1:35:43| and then a staff recommendation made like this today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5743)|
| 1:35:47| Well, we're talking about two separate plans there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5747)|
| 1:35:49| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5749)|
| 1:35:50| Councilman Becker was talking about the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5750)|
| 1:35:52| Councilman Personarati was talking about the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5752)|
| 1:35:55| They were both done at different times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5755)|
| 1:35:59| But staff feels that offices are compatible with residential neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5759)|
| 1:36:06| Neighborhoods are made up of more than just houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5766)|
| 1:36:11| Particularly in areas like this where there is an arterial highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5771)|
| 1:36:15| offices actually make good neighbors to neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5775)|
| 1:36:20| They provide eyes in the neighborhood during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5780)|
| 1:36:23| They leave at night when the rest of the neighborhood comes back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5783)|
| 1:36:27| This particular house is of the same form as all of the other houses in the particular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5787)|
| 1:36:34| As you look at the individual lots moving farther out Tazewell Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5794)|
| 1:36:38| the next five lots all front on side streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5798)|
| 1:36:41| This particular house fronts on Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5801)|
| 1:36:45| As you move beyond those five houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5805)|
| 1:36:48| then you get into the Tazewell Pike Neighborhood Conservation Overlay District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5808)|
| 1:36:53| which has a completely different set of rules to apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5813)|
| 1:36:58| There just isn't any evidence that commercial creep has followed the offices in this particular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5818)|
| 1:37:05| There is no commercial zoning along Tazewell Pike other than back at the intersection with Jacksboro Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5825)|
| 1:37:13| The existing zoning that surrounds most of the other offices in this area is R2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5833)|
| 1:37:22| which is relatively high-density or medium-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5842)|
| 1:37:26| There are office uses allowed within that zone district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5846)|
| 1:37:30| which is how some of those existing offices have occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5850)|
| 1:37:35| They can apply for a use on review for medical-related offices, for example, in an R2 district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5855)|
| 1:37:43| So offices can be compatible with neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5863)|
| 1:37:47| In fact, in certain situations we believe they're very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5867)|
| 1:37:52| We are drafting a new office residential zone district that we hope to have on the MPC agenda next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5872)|
| 1:38:01| that will create a set of design standards and dimensional standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5881)|
| 1:38:07| that are more in keeping with some of the residential zone districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5887)|
| 1:38:11| and this would be a great application of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5891)|
| 1:38:16| Right now all we have available is the O1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5896)|
| 1:38:19| and we have this particular existing house, which, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5899)|
| 1:38:22| we've had this debate about form-based codes for the last several years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5902)|
| 1:38:27| where we've decided to stop worrying about uses so much and focus on form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5907)|
| 1:38:33| and this particular house is of the form that we would describe in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5913)|
| 1:38:39| So that's how we came to our recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5919)|
| 1:38:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5923)|
| 1:38:44| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5924)|
| 1:38:46| Mr. Donaldson, you're saying that you're preparing to bring a new office zone to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5926)|
| 1:38:56| and then to this council that might be more appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5936)|
| 1:38:59| Is that what I understood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5939)|
| 1:39:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5940)|
| 1:39:02| So it would not make sense to rezone this to O1 as it's proposed right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5942)|
| 1:39:08| but rather if they did want to come back and apply under this new zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5948)|
| 1:39:13| then that's something that could be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5953)|
| 1:39:15| Assuming it's approved, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5955)|
| 1:39:16| If it's approved, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5956)|
| 1:39:18| And, of course, it's not a very big lot, but you're talking about the form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5958)|
| 1:39:23| but obviously if we were to rezone O1, this existing structure could go away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5963)|
| 1:39:29| and it could be replaced with another structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5969)|
| 1:39:32| that wouldn't necessarily be as compatible under the O1 zone as what's there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5972)|
| 1:39:39| If you look at the O1 compared to R1, the setbacks actually are greater than R1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5979)|
| 1:39:45| but there is a greater height available in the O1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5985)|
| 1:39:49| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5989)|
| 1:39:50| It's a small lot, so you couldn't really spread out anymore, but you could go higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5990)|
| 1:39:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5994)|
| 1:39:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5995)|
| 1:39:56| The motion and the second on the floor is to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5996)|
| 1:39:59| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=5999)|
| 1:40:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=6001)|
| 1:40:02| Remember, if you vote for, you're voting to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=6002)|
| 1:40:04| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=6004)|
| 1:40:06| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=6006)|
| 1:40:08| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=6008)|
| 1:40:10| I heard one no in eight ayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=6010)|
| 1:40:13| Did I have that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=6013)|
| 1:40:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=6015)|
| 1:40:16| The motion is approved, which is to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=6016)|
| 1:40:21| 12E is an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=6021)|
| 1:40:22| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=6022)|
| 1:40:23| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=6023)|
| 1:40:24| I'm a little slow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=6024)|
| 1:40:25| That means no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=6025)|
| 1:40:26| That means no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=6026)|
| 1:40:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=6027)|
| 1:40:28| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=6028)|
| 1:40:29| I'll be back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=6029)|
| 1:40:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=6030)|
| 1:40:31| I think the next ordinance is moot now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=6031)|
| 1:40:36| 12H is an emergency ordinance of the council appropriating the sum of $400| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=6036)|
| 1:40:40| from the Community Improvement 202 Fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=6040)|
| 1:40:42| and donating same to Bearden Senior High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=6042)|
| 1:40:44| to be utilized for their project graduation celebration for the class of 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080226?start=6044)|
