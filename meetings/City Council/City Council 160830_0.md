| 0:00:54| a decision for the best of our own community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=54)|

| 0:01:04| to find ways to bring each other together in a common cause rather than undertaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=64)|
| 0:01:11| activities that pull us apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=71)|

| 0:02:23| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=143)|

| 0:02:26| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=146)|
| 0:02:27| For the Mayor's Report, first I want to acknowledge an event that happened last week, which was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=147)|
| 0:02:33| the one-year anniversary celebration for the Knoxville Extreme Energy Makeover, or KEEM,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=153)|
| 0:02:39| K-E-E-M, as we call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=159)|
| 0:02:41| Federal Council members were able to join us at Ashley Nicole Dream Playground last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=161)|
| 0:02:45| Thursday for the party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=165)|
| 0:02:47| This marked a year since we began the KEEM program in partnership with the Community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=167)|
| 0:02:51| Action Committee, CAC, and TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=171)|
| 0:02:54| You'll recall that TVA contributed $15 million to help weatherize homes for low-income residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=174)|
| 0:03:01| across Knoxville, and we've made significant progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=181)|
| 0:03:04| More than 600 homes have been weatherized or had energy efficiency upgrades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=184)|
| 0:03:11| We've saved enough energy so far to power an average of 225 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=191)|
| 0:03:19| It was a great event, and of course that work is continuing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=199)|
| 0:03:22| There's one more year left to spend the dollars, and they anticipate having about 700 or so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=202)|
| 0:03:28| more homes this next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=208)|
| 0:03:30| So we appreciate CAC, all of the partners, TVA, KUB, and I want to give a special thanks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=210)|
| 0:03:37| to Erin Gill, our Sustainability Director, for her leadership, along with Peter Ahrens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=217)|
| 0:03:42| and his folks in Plans Review and Inspections, in addition to the partners I've mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=222)|
| 0:03:47| Okay, so moving on to this Thursday, September 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=227)|
| 0:03:51| I think everybody knows it's football time in Tennessee, and so if you're going to Thursday's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=231)|
| 0:03:58| game or if you're going to be around downtown that day, please be aware of the traffic flow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=238)|
| 0:04:07| patterns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=247)|
| 0:04:08| We don't usually have a game on weekdays, a home game on weekdays, and downtown workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=248)|
| 0:04:14| will be vacating spaces and public garages as UT fans start arriving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=254)|
| 0:04:20| We ask that fans plan ahead and have a backup plan for where to park if the garage you usually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=260)|
| 0:04:25| park in is full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=265)|
| 0:04:26| The Civic Coliseum Garage is a good option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=266)|
| 0:04:30| There typically are plenty of spaces available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=270)|
| 0:04:33| Game day shuttles leave from the Coliseum Garage, and CAT regular buses can be boarded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=273)|
| 0:04:38| at Knoxville Station, which is right next to the garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=278)|
| 0:04:41| So to plan your game day commute strategy, please visit our website at www.knoxviltn.gov| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=281)|
| 0:04:50| slash game day, game day, all one word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=290)|
| 0:04:55| That will give you details about traffic routes, detours, garage options, game day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=295)|
| 0:05:00| shuttles, and the regular CAT bus service, as well as UT's rules for what you can and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=300)|
| 0:05:06| cannot bring into the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=306)|
| 0:05:09| Be sure to allow plenty of extra time to get parked and to get to Neyland Stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=309)|
| 0:05:14| City offices will be open as usual on Thursday, however, because of anticipated traffic congestion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=314)|
| 0:05:19| and detours, City Court has rescheduled its Thursday evening court session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=319)|
| 0:05:25| People with cases that had been scheduled for Thursday should have received notices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=325)|
| 0:05:29| with their newly reset court dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=329)|
| 0:05:31| Anyone who wants to confirm their court date can call the City's hotline at 311.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=331)|
| 0:05:37| On a historical note, Jesse's always good about giving me historical notes, this will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=337)|
| 0:05:42| be the Vols' first Thursday home football game since Thanksgiving of 1938.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=342)|
| 0:05:54| But we think that's a good omen, because the Vols walloped Kentucky 46-0 in that game| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=354)|
| 0:05:59| en route to a national championship, so let's hope that is a good omen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=359)|
| 0:06:04| So in terms of speaking of city offices, they will be closed, they'll be open on Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=364)|
| 0:06:10| but they will be closed next Monday, September 5th for the Labor Day holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=370)|
| 0:06:15| But our residential garbage and the recycling services will run as usual, as with our contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=375)|
| 0:06:22| So be sure to put out your bins if you have Monday pick up, and of course we hope everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=382)|
| 0:06:26| enjoys the holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=386)|
| 0:06:28| Finally, there will be an observance on the morning of Sunday, September 11th, our 9-11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=388)|
| 0:06:34| our annual 9-11 memorial, it will be here on the front lawn of the City-County Building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=394)|
| 0:06:40| in honor of those lost in the terrorist attacks of 2001, that's 15 years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=400)|
| 0:06:46| So the ceremony will start at 8.40 a.m. and will include a reciting of the names of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=406)|
| 0:06:51| civilians who were killed that day, along with the placing of the wreath, and of course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=411)|
| 0:06:55| we invite anybody, everybody to come and join us on Sunday morning at 8.40 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=415)|
| 0:07:02| That is the end of my remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=422)|
| 0:07:05| Council, anybody have a report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=425)|
| 0:07:08| Okay, we'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=428)|

| 0:20:03| of commercially zoned property in the area that is not being used presently, and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1203)|
| 0:20:09| before you add to the inventory, maybe some of it should be used before you rezone additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1209)|
| 0:20:15| property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1215)|

| 0:20:22| To be commercial, but simply that there's more commercial land that's unused?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1226)|
| 0:20:27| It's basically sandwiched in between other commercially zoned properties there, but again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1227)|
| 0:20:32| there is a significant inventory of property already in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1232)|
| 0:20:35| Right, but that's different than saying it was an inconsistent use, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1235)|

| 0:23:47| Councilman Dalibanti.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1427)|
| 0:23:48| Yeah, this is such a big item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1428)|
| 0:23:50| I would hope that Ms. Fitzgerald or Christy or someone could just tell us about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1430)|
| 0:23:55| We're talking about a $1.9 million a year charge, and I guess the startup year has an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1435)|
| 0:24:00| extra $426,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| It obviously is designed to improve health and avoid illness and all those kinds of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1443)|
| 0:24:08| but I would like to hear a little bit more about it since it is a pretty major expenditure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1448)|
| 0:24:13| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1453)|
| 0:24:14| Christine Fitzgerald, benefits manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| The additional, the cost that we're paying right now is about $1.4 million, so the additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1456)|
| 0:24:21| $500,000 is really for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1461)|
| 0:24:23| We'll be adding a part-time MD, another advanced nurse practitioner to carry on health and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1463)|
| 0:24:29| wellness services, and a current nurse practitioner or a similar nurse practitioner to handle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1469)|
| 0:24:34| occupational services for the clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| We'll be adding a part-time physical therapist, which we do not have, and an additional LPN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1477)|
| 0:24:43| So the staffing, increased staffing is what that $500,000 is for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1483)|
| 0:24:49| The startup costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1489)|
| 0:24:50| That's part of the startup, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1490)|
| 0:24:52| Well, that's the difference between the $1.4 currently that Summit Medical is charging us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1492)|
| 0:24:56| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1496)|
| 0:24:57| And this outfit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1497)|
| 0:24:58| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1498)|
| 0:24:59| The startup costs, we think, are very conservative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1499)|
| 0:25:03| I think half of it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1503)|
| 0:25:05| You won't spend that much, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1505)|
| 0:25:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1507)|
| 0:25:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1508)|
| 0:25:09| Half of it, they're attributing to salaries, and I don't believe that they can hire anyone before the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1509)|
| 0:25:14| contract's in place, so it seems like that's a moot point, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1514)|
| 0:25:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1518)|
| 0:25:19| And your goal at the end of the day is to get healthier employees and less charges for workers' comp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1519)|
| 0:25:26| or severe intervention medical treatment, I take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1526)|
| 0:25:30| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1530)|
| 0:25:31| We really want to grow the health and wellness side of the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1531)|
| 0:25:33| We feel like we've got a solid occupational health program, but we do not really have a solid health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1533)|
| 0:25:39| and wellness program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1539)|
| 0:25:40| We don't have time to see very many acutes because we're really busy seeing workers' compensation claims| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1540)|
| 0:25:45| and annual physicals for police and fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1545)|
| 0:25:48| So to be able to open up more time for acutes would save money on our health plan, too, because they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1548)|
| 0:25:53| wouldn't be going to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1553)|
| 0:25:54| They could come to the center for a sick visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1554)|
| 0:25:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1557)|
| 0:25:58| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1558)|
| 0:25:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1559)|
| 0:26:00| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1560)|
| 0:26:01| Yeah, I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1561)|
| 0:26:02| How long have you been with Summit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1562)|
| 0:26:04| Since 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1564)|
| 0:26:07| Was that the first company we'd been with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1567)|
| 0:26:11| Or was that their launch into this type of program with occupational?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1571)|
| 0:26:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1576)|
| 0:26:17| We had a center, and it was actually staffed by city employees a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1577)|
| 0:26:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1583)|
| 0:26:24| And then we did away with that model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| Family care specialists was our vendor for a period of time, and then we went out to market in 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1586)|
| 0:26:32| and that's when Summit took over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1592)|
| 0:26:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1594)|
| 0:26:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1595)|
| 0:26:36| That's what I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1596)|
| 0:26:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1597)|
| 0:26:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1598)|
| 0:26:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1599)|
| 0:26:40| Thank you, Christine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1600)|
| 0:26:41| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1601)|
| 0:26:42| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1602)|
| 0:26:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1603)|
| 0:26:44| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1604)|
| 0:26:45| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1605)|
| 0:26:47| 11D is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with HS Construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1607)|

| 0:27:00| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1621)|
| 0:27:02| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1625)|
| 0:27:07| I had some heartburn, I think, like some other members of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1627)|
| 0:27:10| because of the huge investment that we're getting ready to make in the Magnolia corridor project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1630)|
| 0:27:16| But I talked with Don Disler, and we do have the option to change its use in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1636)|
| 0:27:23| We just have to negotiate with the federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1643)|
| 0:27:27| And there's a formula, from what I'm aware, that we could get it in private hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1647)|
| 0:27:34| So, you know, I certainly am somewhat reluctant to sort of start a redevelopment plan with a service parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1654)|
| 0:27:42| I think it will sort of clean up the area in the short term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1662)|
| 0:27:46| And I guess I'd encourage the city and anyone that's – anytime there's a potential to change it, that we keep our mind open on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1666)|
| 0:27:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1677)|
| 0:27:59| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1679)|
| 0:28:00| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| Well, I still have a little bit of heartburn with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1682)|
| 0:28:07| According to Don's email that we got this week, so far invested into this lot is $247,951.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1687)|
| 0:28:18| $170,000 of that was the purchase price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1698)|
| 0:28:23| With the improvements that were before us tonight to approve, you're going to have $575,000 in 31 parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1703)|
| 0:28:32| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1712)|
| 0:28:33| And, you know, I realize that some of the density of the parking is reduced in order to have extra landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1713)|
| 0:28:41| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1721)|
| 0:28:44| That's just a really hefty price for – and not only for the – be the first property in off in the redevelopment district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1724)|
| 0:28:53| You know, almost $600,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1733)|
| 0:28:55| Yeah, I mean, it might be able to be improved later on, but, I mean, you've also invested $600,000 that you're going to walk away from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1735)|
| 0:29:01| So, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1741)|
| 0:29:03| I just – I don't know if there are other options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1743)|
| 0:29:05| That property was purchased in June of 2015, so we've owned it just a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1745)|
| 0:29:10| We may have been working on it for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| It's certainly blighted now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1754)|
| 0:29:15| And it's certainly way underutilized now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1755)|
| 0:29:17| I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1757)|
| 0:29:21| But, anyway, I think that's kind of what you're facing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1761)|
| 0:29:23| I mean, you're facing – I don't think anybody – I mean, it's $20,000 a spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1763)|
| 0:29:28| So, I mean, we're building parking garages for 20,000 spots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1768)|
| 0:29:33| Maybe the best thing for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1773)|
| 0:29:34| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1774)|
| 0:29:35| I just raised a concern and raised the issue to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1775)|
| 0:29:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1780)|
| 0:29:41| Vice Mayor Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1781)|
| 0:29:42| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1782)|
| 0:29:43| Well, we've had two heartburns, but I think I have indigestion over this one, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1783)|
| 0:29:47| considering what it is we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1787)|
| 0:29:50| I, too, am concerned about the fact that we're starting a major development down Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1790)|
| 0:29:55| And I'm afraid – and I'd like for Dr. Lyons maybe to address this too – that the perception is, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1795)|
| 0:30:01| the city's going to start and they're going to put in a parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1801)|
| 0:30:04| And that just sort of bothers me a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1804)|
| 0:30:07| I know it's going to be a parking lot that's going to be well landscaped and this sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1807)|
| 0:30:11| but it just seems like not a very good use of a very valuable piece of property that could be within a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1811)|
| 0:30:18| or two years, you know, developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1818)|
| 0:30:20| I mean, we don't know for sure, but we're getting ready to invest quite a bit of money into a parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1820)|
| 0:30:26| So, Dr. Lyons, do you want to address that concern that I have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1826)|
| 0:30:31| Sure, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1831)|
| 0:30:32| We very much appreciate the points that are raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1832)|
| 0:30:36| I think it's inarguable that a building is superior to a parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1836)|
| 0:30:39| especially when we're taking on a major redevelopment area on a major corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1839)|
| 0:30:43| I think one thing to point out in terms of the funding is that this is largely grant funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1843)|
| 0:30:48| that is specific to be supporting CAD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1848)|
| 0:30:50| I think that's part of the equation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| But that doesn't get to the major point you're raising about the entrance to the redevelopment area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1852)|
| 0:30:58| I think the major point I would stress there is that this would serve as a holding area right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1858)|
| 0:31:05| for a much more attractive entrance, which will have signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1865)|
| 0:31:08| Don Michelle could speak to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1868)|
| 0:31:09| She spoke a little last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1869)|
| 0:31:10| That would serve as a nice entrance to a large area that has an awful lot of developable land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1870)|
| 0:31:16| And I think if we really thought the market being what it is and the development patterns being what they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1876)|
| 0:31:22| that we could look forward to putting this lot out for proposals for the kind of building we would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1882)|
| 0:31:30| and getting a response anywhere in the near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| I don't think we're close to that, but I do think that as the streetscape is put in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1892)|
| 0:31:36| and as development hopefully takes off, that will be an option in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1896)|
| 0:31:40| So I do see, I mean, I want to emphasize the agreement with the general concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1900)|
| 0:31:46| that this is an optimal right now, but in practical terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1906)|
| 0:31:49| both in the world of what development investment we see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1909)|
| 0:31:54| and the fact that this will be an attractive entrance to a corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1914)|
| 0:31:59| that I think will enhance the development down the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1919)|
| 0:32:03| And this will give us control over the property that were it not in our possession, we wouldn't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1923)|
| 0:32:09| And some really, it's better to have a parking lot we can go into later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1929)|
| 0:32:13| than a substandard building, a one-story building, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1933)|
| 0:32:17| used for convenience or something that somebody might choose to put up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1937)|
| 0:32:21| if we put it out for some kind of consideration by the private sector right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1941)|
| 0:32:26| How does that work if, say, in two years you do put it out for bids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1946)|
| 0:32:30| as far as the money that we've invested in it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1950)|
| 0:32:33| We would have to, and I think there are formulas through the federal government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1953)|
| 0:32:38| of what we would have to repay them if we did not use it for CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| I think there are, Don Disler did raise in our conversations the possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1962)|
| 0:32:47| that possibly down the line we could have a transit use there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1967)|
| 0:32:52| type use that would involve a structure, a possible structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1972)|
| 0:32:55| that possibly could have parking in it that would involve us not having to pay anything back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1975)|
| 0:32:59| That might be one consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| But were it to go private and non-transit related, we would have to repay the federal investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1981)|
| 0:33:07| And there are formulas that look to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1987)|
| 0:33:10| But I think if we're talking about what might happen down the line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| and if we were to compare it to Cumberland, you'd have a significant value on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1993)|
| 0:33:18| for development later that might make that more digestible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=1998)|
| 0:33:22| I can't help me remember this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| I can't remember with the plan, with the Magnolia plan, what we showed the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2004)|
| 0:33:29| Was the parking lot there at that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| I can't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2011)|
| 0:33:32| I know there was an entranceway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2012)|
| 0:33:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2013)|
| 0:33:34| But was the parking lot there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2014)|
| 0:33:35| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2015)|
| 0:33:36| Was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2016)|
| 0:33:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2017)|
| 0:33:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2018)|
| 0:33:39| Councilman Delavar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2019)|
| 0:33:40| Yeah, I just wanted to, I appreciate my colleagues bringing out all these points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| but I did want to add that the proposal from CAT also makes note that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2022)|
| 0:33:47| by freeing up some parking places currently being used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2027)|
| 0:33:50| they will be able to put buses and other structures in an enclosed and safe place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2030)|
| 0:33:57| which has some value because they're very expensive vehicles that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2037)|
| 0:34:01| So there is a collateral benefit that we should bear in mind as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2041)|
| 0:34:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2046)|
| 0:34:07| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2047)|
| 0:34:08| Good discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2048)|
| 0:34:09| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2051)|
| 0:34:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2052)|
| 0:34:13| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2053)|
| 0:34:14| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| 11E is a resolution authorizing the mayor to amend contract number C-11-0160| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2057)|
| 0:34:23| with Vaughn and Milton Consulting Engineers Incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2063)|
| 0:34:26| for the West Jackson Avenue Streetscapes Project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2066)|
| 0:34:29| increasing the amount by $74,255 for a total contract amount of $350,230| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2069)|
| 0:34:37| and extending the date of completion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2080)|
| 0:34:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2081)|
| 0:34:42| Councilman Delgadope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2082)|
| 0:34:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2083)|
| 0:34:44| Jim Hagerman is here, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2084)|
| 0:34:45| No, I guess we have Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2085)|
| 0:34:48| My concern is simply this thing has more than doubled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2088)|
| 0:34:51| since we issued the original contract of Vaughn and Milton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2091)|
| 0:34:55| I understand that we're kind of changing some of the things we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2095)|
| 0:34:58| and changing their scope of activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2098)|
| 0:35:01| We've already raised the price once because of added duration and scope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2101)|
| 0:35:05| but could you just address that, what the end product is going to take us to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2105)|
| 0:35:10| Well, this particular amendment was due to the fact that the contract was bid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2110)|
| 0:35:17| and the bids came in high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2117)|
| 0:35:20| Included in those bids were some utility work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2120)|
| 0:35:24| We're going to pull that utility work out because it was really high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2124)|
| 0:35:28| and KUB is going to do that work separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2128)|
| 0:35:31| So there's some cost to modifying the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2131)|
| 0:35:36| In preparation to go out for bid again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2136)|
| 0:35:39| Yes, we have to re-bid it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2139)|
| 0:35:42| In addition to that, we had originally hoped that we would be able to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2142)|
| 0:35:46| some of the construction engineering inspection in-house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2146)|
| 0:35:50| and only use the consultant part-time, but we are not able to do that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2150)|
| 0:35:56| Our civil engineering division is covered up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2156)|
| 0:36:00| and this was one way we could supplement their work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2160)|
| 0:36:04| by asking the consultant to handle that construction inspection work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2164)|
| 0:36:09| Okay. Well, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| Thank you. We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2173)|
| 0:36:15| Any opposed? The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2175)|
| 0:36:18| 11F is a resolution authorizing the Mayor to execute all documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2178)|
| 0:36:21| on behalf of the City of Knoxville necessary to acquire in fee simple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2181)|
| 0:36:25| property located at 2622 Lay Avenue owned by Wilda A. Green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2185)|
| 0:36:30| for $46,000 to alleviate flooding issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| So moved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2193)|
| 0:36:35| We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2195)|
| 0:36:38| Any opposed? The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2198)|
| 0:36:42| 11G is a resolution authorizing the acquisition by condemnation if necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2202)|
| 0:36:46| of a slope easement and temporary construction easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2206)|
| 0:36:49| within certain real property located at 215 South Castle Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2209)|
| 0:36:53| as part of the South Castle Street sidewalk improvements project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2213)|
| 0:36:57| Moved to approve. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2217)|
| 0:36:59| We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| Any opposed? The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| 11H is a resolution authorizing the acquisition by condemnation if necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2224)|
| 0:37:08| of a slope easement and temporary construction easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2228)|
| 0:37:11| within certain real property located at 211 South Castle Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2231)|
| 0:37:15| as part of the South Castle Street sidewalk improvements project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2235)|
| 0:37:18| Moved to approve. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2240)|
| 0:37:23| Any opposed? The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2243)|
| 0:37:27| Could I ask a question on that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2247)|
| 0:37:31| Once this has been approved, when do we expect to start working on that sidewalk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2251)|
| 0:37:38| The way the process works with a federally funded project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2258)|
| 0:37:43| we must certify the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| Once we have to condemn these, once the court grants us the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2265)|
| 0:37:51| then TDOT will certify right-of-way and then we can bid the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2271)|
| 0:37:57| It depends on how long it takes us to have that go to court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2277)|
| 0:38:03| and the court grant us that and TDOT approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2283)|
| 0:38:06| We could still be several months away from construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2286)|
| 0:38:13| Are we looking at maybe next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2293)|
| 0:38:16| Yes. Possibly. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| Councilman Del Verte.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| I was just going to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2303)|
| 0:38:24| I think legal counsel will tell you that there's a quick take provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2304)|
| 0:38:30| for condemnation by public authorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2310)|
| 0:38:33| and they can get title when they file the papers with the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2313)|
| 0:38:37| They have to pay the money in the court and fight about how much it's worth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2317)|
| 0:38:40| or something like that, but it's designed to keep governments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2320)|
| 0:38:43| from having to wait forever to start a project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2323)|
| 0:38:46| So that may work to your advantage in terms of getting through the paperwork,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2326)|
| 0:38:50| getting it filed, and getting title right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2330)|
| 0:38:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| Okay. I think we voted on that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2336)|
| 0:38:58| Okay. So next. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2338)|
| 0:39:01| 11A is the resolution authorizing the mayor to execute any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2341)|

| 0:39:10| to enhance the police department's gun safety awareness program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2350)|
| 0:39:14| So moved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2354)|
| 0:39:16| We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2358)|

| 0:40:04| I think we have several people that signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2404)|
| 0:40:07| Would you like to hear from them first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2409)|
| 0:40:10| Okay. So we start with those who are for this, and that would be Rick Henchey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2410)|
| 0:40:15| and I believe you brought Lanny Cote and somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2415)|
| 0:40:21| So if you would come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2421)|
| 0:40:22| The way the rules of council are is you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2422)|
| 0:40:26| You can have up to three speakers, up to five minutes each,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| and I'll set the timer and we'll let you know as you're progressing on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2429)|
| 0:40:34| But please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2434)|
| 0:40:36| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2436)|
| 0:40:37| I'm Rick Henchey, Chief Financial Officer for Land Rover of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2437)|
| 0:40:42| and Mr. Furrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2442)|
| 0:40:44| I'm a Knoxville resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2444)|
| 0:40:45| I live at 3736 Gooseneck Drive in south Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2445)|
| 0:40:51| I also have with me Lanny Cote from Cote Associates, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2451)|
| 0:40:54| and Billy Fulgen from Fulgen McIndoe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2454)|
| 0:40:57| Lanny is our architect and Billy is the engineer on the project at this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2457)|
| 0:41:02| I'm speaking tonight on behalf of the owner as Mr. Furrow was out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2462)|
| 0:41:07| This was postponed at the meeting on August 16th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2467)|
| 0:41:12| and subsequent to that meeting Mr. Furrow engaged Lanny Cote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2472)|
| 0:41:16| and Cote Associates to prepare drawings and plans that would provide information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2476)|
| 0:41:21| on a possible building footprint and location on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2481)|
| 0:41:26| as well as to provide information related to a dense landscape buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2486)|
| 0:41:31| and some information on control directional lighting that could be utilized on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2491)|
| 0:41:36| to minimize light intrusion into the adjacent neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2496)|
| 0:41:41| As soon as that information was completed by Mr. Cote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2501)|
| 0:41:45| Mr. Furrow scheduled a meeting with the interested Cogdell Road area residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2505)|
| 0:41:51| That meeting took place on August 25th, approximately at 5 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2511)|
| 0:41:56| The meeting was held at the existing Land Rover dealership on Parkside Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2516)|
| 0:42:01| We had a previous meeting with residents there, so it was the same location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2521)|
| 0:42:06| At that meeting, Mr. Furrow presented for review and discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2526)|
| 0:42:11| the drawing of the property providing the proposed building footprint and location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2531)|
| 0:42:17| On that same drawing, the location of the dense landscape buffer was also shown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2537)|
| 0:42:23| and there was some additional information regarding a landscape planting plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2543)|
| 0:42:27| and irrigation details were also included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2547)|
| 0:42:30| There was also technical information on controlled directional lighting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2550)|
| 0:42:35| that could be utilized on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2555)|
| 0:42:40| That information above, along with some engineering site plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2560)|
| 0:42:43| were emailed to each of the council members to their email address that's published on the city website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2563)|
| 0:42:51| That information was sent on Friday, August 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2571)|
| 0:42:57| During the meeting last Thursday, Mr. Furrow also offered to install| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2577)|
| 0:43:02| a wooden privacy slash security fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2582)|
| 0:43:06| that could be installed on either side of the dense landscape buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2586)|
| 0:43:10| and that would basically be at the choice of the residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2590)|
| 0:43:14| In addition, at the meeting, Mr. Furrow also discussed the property that we're discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2594)|
| 0:43:21| We'll have two entrances into it, both of which will come off of Parkside Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2601)|
| 0:43:25| It'll have a Parkside Drive address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2605)|
| 0:43:28| Cogdell Road will be closed so that there will be no access into this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2608)|
| 0:43:33| and no access through to Parkside Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2613)|
| 0:43:37| He also agreed there will be no external loudspeakers used on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2617)|
| 0:43:43| and we'll use controlled directional lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2623)|
| 0:43:46| We'll minimize the use of the lighting during non-business hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2626)|
| 0:43:50| and try and keep it only to a security level of lighting during those hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2630)|
| 0:43:57| Basically, Mr. Furrow wants to be a good neighbor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2637)|
| 0:44:01| minimize the impact of the property use to the neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2641)|
| 0:44:06| and do what's reasonably and economically feasible to accommodate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2646)|
| 0:44:12| At this point in time, I'd like to introduce Lanny Cope from Cope Associates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2652)|
| 0:44:16| and let him show one of the drawings that was presented at the meeting last Thursday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2656)|
| 0:44:22| and fill in some of my gaps. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2662)|
| 0:44:25| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| Lanny Cope, Cope Architecture, 2607 Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2667)|
| 0:44:33| This is the plan that was presented to the community on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2673)|
| 0:44:39| I was not personally there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| Please stay with the microphone there so we can hear you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| Can you see this plan from where you are, or should we move forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2684)|
| 0:44:48| I think the council, they have copies, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2688)|
| 0:44:51| You can point out features to us that are important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2691)|
| 0:44:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2694)|
| 0:44:55| To start with, the property as shown here, the red line, the thick red line, is the property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2695)|
| 0:45:05| The property that is on the lower side of this sheet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2705)|
| 0:45:09| is the residential properties that have expressed concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2709)|
| 0:45:15| You'll see that all along this edge of the property there is a green area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2715)|
| 0:45:22| That is the densely landscaped area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2722)|
| 0:45:26| We have commissioned a reputable local landscape architect, Mike Fowler of Ross Fowler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2726)|
| 0:45:38| to assist us with proper landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2738)|
| 0:45:43| I think if you look at all of Mr. Furrow's properties throughout the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2743)|
| 0:45:49| you will take note that we have very elaborate landscaping and it is very well maintained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2749)|
| 0:45:59| As Mr. Henchey mentioned, the solid fence could be incorporated in addition to the landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2759)|
| 0:46:09| The fence could be put on our side of the 15-foot landscape buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2769)|
| 0:46:14| making the landscaping actually increasing the value of the residential properties as opposed to our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2774)|
| 0:46:24| There were concerns that were expressed over light bleed over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2784)|
| 0:46:29| Excuse me, are you saying the fence is inside the landscaping?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2789)|
| 0:46:32| We're saying that it would be the choice of the residential owners to the rear of our property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2792)|
| 0:46:42| as to whether they wanted the fence along the property line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2802)|
| 0:46:45| or whether they wanted to take advantage of this 15-foot thick landscape buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2805)|
| 0:46:50| that we will be planting to enhance their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2810)|
| 0:47:00| In addition to the landscaping, I understand there's a concern about light bleed over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2820)|
| 0:47:05| We have light fixtures that we will be using that have control cutoffs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2825)|
| 0:47:12| that will ensure that there is no light bleed over onto the residential properties at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2832)|
| 0:47:23| Finally, what I would say is this plan as submitted here exceeds every requirement of the C6 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2843)|
| 0:47:35| It goes beyond what is required in the C6 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2855)|
| 0:47:40| So I'm here to answer any questions that anyone would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2860)|
| 0:47:46| about the specifics of this particular site plan layout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2866)|
| 0:47:52| Thank you. Do you want to hear from the third person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2872)|
| 0:47:55| We'll go ahead and hear from the third person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2875)|
| 0:47:57| Then they may ask you questions, Mr. Cope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2877)|
| 0:48:00| Are you speaking, Mr. Fulgham?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2880)|
| 0:48:06| Mr. Fulgham is here if there's questions we need his expertise on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2886)|
| 0:48:09| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| So now we'll hear – does anybody want to ask questions of these individuals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2891)|
| 0:48:15| If not, then we'll go ahead to the – do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2895)|
| 0:48:18| Vice Mayor Grieve may have some questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2898)|
| 0:48:24| Lanny, one of the questions I have concerns looking at the 2008 agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2904)|
| 0:48:30| that was made with Mr. Furrow in the neighborhood when the property was brought into the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2910)|
| 0:48:35| How does this differ from 2008 in terms of what was committed back then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2915)|
| 0:48:41| Dwayne, I have to tell you I'm not familiar with what was submitted back then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2921)|
| 0:48:46| From what I can gather from what I read in the 2008 agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2926)|
| 0:48:51| between the neighborhood and Mr. Furrow, the only difference from what I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2931)|
| 0:48:56| and we probably need clarification on this, is that you all have agreed to add a fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2936)|
| 0:49:02| Otherwise, the rest of what you're talking about was really an agreement made back in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2942)|
| 0:49:07| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2947)|
| 0:49:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2948)|
| 0:49:09| The setback and the buffer were agreed then is my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2949)|
| 0:49:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2952)|
| 0:49:13| And so was the lighting as well as loudspeakers from what I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2953)|
| 0:49:18| Mr. Kelly can address that for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2958)|
| 0:49:21| But the main difference that I see now is what you're saying is that you would allow the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2961)|
| 0:49:27| if this were to pass, you would allow the neighborhood to decide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2967)|
| 0:49:30| do they want the fence on their side or do they want greenery?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2970)|
| 0:49:33| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2973)|
| 0:49:34| It's really the only difference from 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2974)|
| 0:49:36| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2978)|
| 0:49:39| Councilman Dalibopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2979)|
| 0:49:40| I realize that there are some other speakers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| but I'm a little confused by that line of questioning since in 2008| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2982)|
| 0:49:46| that was supposed to be an office zone track, which would be a lesser use than a commercial track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2986)|
| 0:49:53| And so these amenities you've been describing are to mitigate any harm that comes from that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=2993)|
| 0:50:00| but it is a change in use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3000)|
| 0:50:02| Office is a much more limited zone in terms of the kind of structures and activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3002)|
| 0:50:08| the number of cars that come, the types of businesses that might be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3008)|
| 0:50:12| So I don't want that, I guess, misunderstanding to persist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3012)|
| 0:50:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3019)|
| 0:50:21| Okay, so now we'll move on to those who are against,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3021)|
| 0:50:24| and I have Brian Johnson, Mary McBride Caduto, and Steve McGee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3024)|
| 0:50:31| I appreciate you all being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3031)|
| 0:50:33| Please state your name and address for the record, and I'll keep you on time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3033)|
| 0:50:37| I'm Brian Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3037)|
| 0:50:38| I live at 336 Landoak Road, and I appreciate the opportunity to speak to you this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3038)|
| 0:50:43| And I would say that that is what our issue is, is the zoning, because it does open a door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3043)|
| 0:50:50| It opens a door for much broader use than what currently is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3050)|
| 0:50:54| There's a lot of unknowns in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3054)|
| 0:50:57| For example, the lighting that will stay on for security would stay on throughout the entire evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3057)|
| 0:51:02| throughout all night, which is different than a lot of office buildings would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3062)|
| 0:51:07| Also, if you'll look at the plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3067)|
| 0:51:09| the location of those light poles in relation to the residents at some places is very close,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3069)|
| 0:51:14| just a few feet away from the residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3074)|
| 0:51:18| And I haven't seen the light yet that doesn't bleed over a little bit when you're looking out your window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3078)|
| 0:51:26| So I would ask this council to keep in place a buffer that has been agreed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3086)|
| 0:51:32| and one that has been shown to be good for a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3092)|
| 0:51:36| I believe it was Councilman De La Volpe at the last council meeting that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3096)|
| 0:51:41| sometimes you have to draw a line somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3101)|
| 0:51:44| And I suggest that that line was drawn in 2008 and that it needs to stay the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3104)|
| 0:51:49| I've lived in that neighborhood since 2002 and plan on raising my family there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3109)|
| 0:51:54| And we're not begrudging Mr. Farrow his ability to try to do business the way he sees fit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3114)|
| 0:51:59| but I want the council to realize that he has options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3119)|
| 0:52:02| They may not be his number one option, but they are options nonetheless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3122)|
| 0:52:06| and some that he agreed to in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3126)|
| 0:52:09| I would ask you to look at the people that are here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3129)|
| 0:52:13| and if you would stand up so they can see how many are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3133)|
| 0:52:17| This is something that our subdivision feels strongly about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3137)|
| 0:52:20| not because of anything we feel towards Mr. Farrow or his ability to do business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3140)|
| 0:52:25| but the one thing I mentioned, there's a lot of unknowns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3145)|
| 0:52:27| There's one thing that is known, is that his business needs will change again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3147)|
| 0:52:31| I run a business myself, and I know one thing about business, it's ever-changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3151)|
| 0:52:35| If you're not changing in business, you're dying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3155)|
| 0:52:38| And so one day Mr. Farrow won't have a need for this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3158)|
| 0:52:41| and one day he will step away from this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3161)|
| 0:52:44| and the door that's open by this council will be able to be walked through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3164)|
| 0:52:49| by any number of uses that are available through this zoning change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3169)|
| 0:52:54| So what we're asking is not anything against a person or against progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3174)|
| 0:52:58| What we're asking is to keep in place a buffer that is reasonable, that was agreed to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3178)|
| 0:53:03| and one that's doing what it needs to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| An office is much different than a car dealership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3185)|
| 0:53:09| and at the meeting I attended with Mr. Farrow last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3189)|
| 0:53:12| he agreed that some of the lights would stay on all night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3192)|
| 0:53:16| and he also agreed that he could not guarantee that one day it wouldn't be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3196)|
| 0:53:20| I think his exact words were, Billy Bob's used cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3200)|
| 0:53:23| Now I also believe that he wants to be a good neighbor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3203)|
| 0:53:27| but I think in this case a line needs to be drawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3207)|
| 0:53:31| Sometimes you just have to say enough is enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3211)|
| 0:53:34| And we're totally willing to have the zoning stay as is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3214)|
| 0:53:39| and have an office come in there and have it to be a buffer between us and Parkside Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3219)|
| 0:53:45| The other thing I'd like to point out about his plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3225)|
| 0:53:47| and I know I'm probably getting close on time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3227)|
| 0:53:49| is that the service bay to his dealership would be facing our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3229)|
| 0:53:55| And I don't have to tell this council what kind of noise and things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3235)|
| 0:53:58| comes out of a service bay of a car dealership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3238)|
| 0:54:01| It's just part of what the business is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3241)|
| 0:54:04| We're asking you to keep a buffer in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3244)|
| 0:54:07| so that the investments we've made as we raise our children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3247)|
| 0:54:11| will be protected by a buffer that's a reasonable zoning for our subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3251)|
| 0:54:17| and that leaves Mr. Farrow with reasonable options for his business as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3257)|
| 0:54:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3262)|
| 0:54:23| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3263)|
| 0:54:25| Now, Ms. Caduto, did I pronounce that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3265)|
| 0:54:28| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3268)|
| 0:54:30| Hi, I'm Mary McBride Caduto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3270)|
| 0:54:32| I live at 341 Landoak Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3272)|
| 0:54:35| Pull it a little closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3275)|
| 0:54:36| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3276)|
| 0:54:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3277)|
| 0:54:38| I'm here to basically reiterate what we've stated in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3278)|
| 0:54:42| is that we really would like to keep this buffer as an office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3282)|
| 0:54:47| Office zoning is a lot less invasive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3287)|
| 0:54:49| I, myself, I've invested over $100,000 in remodeling and the renovation of my home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3289)|
| 0:54:55| and it will all be for naught because my property value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3295)|
| 0:55:01| I'm right on the corner of the properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3301)|
| 0:55:06| very close to the other adjoining properties to this property that wants to be rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3306)|
| 0:55:13| As we've stated before, we're not trying to hinder Mr. Farrow's ability to grow and thrive in his business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3313)|
| 0:55:26| but there are so many more options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3326)|
| 0:55:29| and honestly I don't see how the dealership will even fit there as well as,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3329)|
| 0:55:37| I know Mr. Copas spent a lot of time on drawings and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3337)|
| 0:55:41| The other issue, too, was what is the building going to look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3341)|
| 0:55:44| and we've been told that they didn't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3344)|
| 0:55:47| although Automotive News released the new Jaguar Land Rover prototype buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3347)|
| 0:55:55| Well, not even prototypes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3355)|
| 0:55:56| It's the new design of their buildings of all the dealerships that the dealerships have to comply with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3356)|
| 0:56:03| So that plan is out there, but it has not been shown to us locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3363)|
| 0:56:10| So we just want to keep that office buffer and protect our neighborhood and protect our investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3370)|
| 0:56:18| and we're not asking anything unreasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3378)|
| 0:56:22| This is just for us to thrive as a neighborhood, as this neighborhood has for over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3382)|
| 0:56:27| My house was built in 1955, and I've lived there since 1993.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3387)|
| 0:56:34| I love my home. I love my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3394)|
| 0:56:38| It's a very peaceful and great neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3398)|
| 0:56:41| As you can see, we've got great neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3401)|
| 0:56:43| It's reviving, and this will kill the revival of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3403)|
| 0:56:47| So we just want to continue to thrive and leave that zoned as office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3407)|
| 0:56:52| and we do appreciate your time and consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3412)|
| 0:56:54| and we hope that you will look upon us as viable citizens of Knoxville and Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3414)|
| 0:57:03| and give us that opportunity to continue to thrive there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3423)|
| 0:57:08| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3428)|
| 0:57:10| And now Mr. McGee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3430)|
| 0:57:13| My name is Steve McGee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3433)|
| 0:57:15| I live at 118 Landoak Road, Knoxville, and I won't go over everything they said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3435)|
| 0:57:22| I've been a resident of this neighborhood for approximately 40 years, bought two houses there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3442)|
| 0:57:28| both of them backed up to office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3448)|
| 0:57:31| Would I have bought my house had it backed up to C6?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3451)|
| 0:57:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3455)|
| 0:57:36| The only thing we're asking for is to go by the 2008 agreement for O1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3456)|
| 0:57:44| I think the neighborhood, we have other O1s around us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3464)|
| 0:57:48| They seem good neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3468)|
| 0:57:50| They are gone home at 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3470)|
| 0:57:52| We don't have to worry about lights in the evening, any noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3472)|
| 0:57:57| Mr. Farrell says he's a good neighbor. I'm sure he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3477)|
| 0:58:00| But somewhere down the road, what is this going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3480)|
| 0:58:04| We know what it's going to be under office zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3484)|
| 0:58:07| It will always be an office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| Under C6, 5, 10 years from now, who knows?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3489)|
| 0:58:16| This is a special area along Parkside Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3496)|
| 0:58:19| because you've got residential houses so close to Parkside Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3499)|
| 0:58:24| And all we're asking for is just the buffer of the O zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3504)|
| 0:58:29| And as was brought up, the conditions we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3509)|
| 0:58:33| the four conditions we have with the O zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3513)|
| 0:58:37| are everything they're offering except a fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3517)|
| 0:58:41| And I think we can live without a fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3521)|
| 0:58:43| if we know it's going to be an office building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3523)|
| 0:58:46| I'd much rather have an office building than a fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3526)|
| 0:58:51| I guess that's about all I had to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3531)|
| 0:58:53| because I don't want to repeat everything they've said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3533)|
| 0:58:56| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3536)|
| 0:58:57| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3537)|
| 0:58:58| Okay, that's the end of the speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3538)|
| 0:59:00| So, counsel, let me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3540)|
| 0:59:03| No, not in this, only in administrative hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3543)|
| 0:59:07| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3547)|
| 0:59:08| I had a question for Mr. Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3548)|
| 0:59:10| So what exactly happened in 2008?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3550)|
| 0:59:13| Was it just, right now we're looking at a parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3553)|
| 0:59:16| that's both zoned, I guess, C6 and O1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3556)|
| 0:59:20| In 2008, was it just the O1 part that was rezoned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3560)|
| 0:59:25| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3565)|
| 0:59:27| What was it zoned beforehand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3567)|
| 0:59:30| It was agricultural when it was in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3570)|
| 0:59:32| It started as agriculturally zoned property in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3572)|
| 0:59:36| There was an application for CA zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3576)|
| 0:59:40| which is comparable to the C4 zone in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3580)|
| 0:59:45| The property at that time was recommended for approval to OB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3585)|
| 0:59:50| with the conditions as currently stated in 2008 in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3590)|
| 0:59:55| The Planning Commission and the Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3595)|
| 0:59:59| approved the OB zoning at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3599)|
| 1:00:02| A little bit later in 2008, that was in January of 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3602)|
| 1:00:07| a little bit later in 2008, the property was annexed by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3607)|
| 1:00:13| The stance at that time was to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3613)|
| 1:00:17| when the city zoning classification was put on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3617)|
| 1:00:21| that you would go with a comparable zone to what it was in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3621)|
| 1:00:25| although there was discussion at that time for C6 zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3625)|
| 1:00:31| as part of the annexation or subsequent to the annexation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3631)|
| 1:00:36| Again, the OB zoning was recommended by the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3636)|
| 1:00:40| and approved by city council in 2008| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3640)|
| 1:00:43| with the same four conditions that you have today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3643)|
| 1:00:46| Well, I guess, so I went out there today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3646)|
| 1:00:49| and it looked like there was a residential home on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3649)|
| 1:00:52| So was it ever zoned residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3652)|
| 1:00:54| It was zoned agriculture in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3654)|
| 1:00:56| It was zoned agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3656)|
| 1:00:58| Agriculture is a zone in the county that has many residences in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3658)|
| 1:01:02| So the zoning to office, was that done by the owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3662)|
| 1:01:06| Was that proposed by the owner in 2008?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3666)|
| 1:01:11| And I guess I'm confused because there was no office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3671)|
| 1:01:14| Mr. Farrell had the property in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3674)|
| 1:01:17| Okay, and he requested, but there was no plan to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3677)|
| 1:01:20| there has been no development and there was no plan to develop it, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3680)|
| 1:01:24| There hasn't been any change in the property since 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3684)|
| 1:01:27| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3687)|
| 1:01:31| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3691)|
| 1:01:32| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3692)|
| 1:01:34| Well, I was just, Mr. Kelly, I was just looking at C6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3694)|
| 1:01:37| and if I understand it, among other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3697)|
| 1:01:40| you can have wholesaling, warehousing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3700)|
| 1:01:44| you can have light industry, you can have halfway houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3704)|
| 1:01:50| maybe that's in every zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3710)|
| 1:01:51| you can have commercial telecommunication towers under a use-on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3711)|
| 1:01:57| you can, I'm sure you can't put a marina there because there's no water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3717)|
| 1:02:01| but you can have funeral establishments, breweries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3721)|
| 1:02:04| other things that might not fit in an office zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3724)|
| 1:02:07| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3727)|
| 1:02:09| In addition to that, you can have any use that's permitted in a C3 zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3729)|
| 1:02:13| which is a general retailing zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3733)|
| 1:02:16| The C6 zone is a, I guess if you want to call it kind of a hybrid zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3736)|
| 1:02:20| it's a mixture of both commercial and light industrial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3740)|
| 1:02:25| All right, and the way our zoning code works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3745)|
| 1:02:27| you drag forward the lower zones, like a C3, and you plop it into C6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3747)|
| 1:02:32| and then you add several items in addition to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3752)|
| 1:02:35| In some cases that happens, not in all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3755)|
| 1:02:37| But in this case it does happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3757)|
| 1:02:39| So you'd have to look at C3 and see what's allowed there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3759)|
| 1:02:42| in addition to what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3762)|
| 1:02:44| Okay, and the second aspect is, of course, we're zoning a piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3764)|
| 1:02:49| and not just the particular use on that drawing or sketch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3769)|
| 1:02:53| or what Mr. Farrow has talked about, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3773)|
| 1:02:55| He would be entitled to any use permitted in the zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3775)|
| 1:02:59| Well, and not only him, but if he sold it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3779)|
| 1:03:01| someone else would come in and say, I have a C6 zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3781)|
| 1:03:04| I've got a couple conditions that have border fencing or shrubbery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3784)|
| 1:03:11| I've got to keep my lights down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3791)|
| 1:03:13| I've got to keep the noise under some type of control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3793)|
| 1:03:16| by not having loudspeakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3796)|
| 1:03:18| But beyond that, they can do whatever that C3 or C6 zone would let them do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3798)|
| 1:03:23| That would be correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3803)|
| 1:03:25| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3805)|
| 1:03:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3806)|
| 1:03:27| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3807)|
| 1:03:29| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3809)|
| 1:03:30| So what we've gotten from last two weeks ago was what we didn't have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3810)|
| 1:03:35| and that was we did not have a site plan, we did not have a landscape plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3815)|
| 1:03:40| and we did not have a lighting plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3820)|
| 1:03:41| This is what we asked for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3821)|
| 1:03:43| and this is in a lot greater detail than what we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3823)|
| 1:03:47| So as to the plans that he's provided us, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3827)|
| 1:03:53| it is a dense landscape plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3833)|
| 1:03:55| with a double row of large, tall evergreen trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3835)|
| 1:03:59| that will grow to 30 to 40 feet tall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3839)|
| 1:04:03| underneath landscaping, sprinkled irrigation, and certainly the grass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3843)|
| 1:04:09| I think I'm not a, I mean, to me that's very adequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3849)|
| 1:04:14| I think it would probably, it certainly meets my expectations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3854)|
| 1:04:20| from where we were last week when we had no plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3860)|
| 1:04:23| I think the idea was he'd bring these plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3863)|
| 1:04:25| and this is how do we make sure that this is what is built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3865)|
| 1:04:30| and this is the way it's put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3870)|
| 1:04:33| I guess that's my question back to Dan, and I'll let Dan answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3873)|
| 1:04:38| So how do we incorporate that into that this is the way it will be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3878)|
| 1:04:46| I don't know that you can truly specify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3886)|
| 1:04:52| that the property be developed as shown on a particular site plan at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3892)|
| 1:04:57| I would defer that to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3897)|
| 1:05:00| I know that if the property is zoned C6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3900)|
| 1:05:06| there will be a staff review of a site plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3906)|
| 1:05:09| that is required as part of the C6 zoning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3909)|
| 1:05:14| It is typically not a qualitative review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3914)|
| 1:05:17| It's more of a zoning compliance review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3917)|
| 1:05:21| to make sure that all the aspects of the zoning district are being complied with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3921)|
| 1:05:28| The conditions, the four conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3928)|
| 1:05:31| we would certainly look at those four conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3931)|
| 1:05:33| to see that they were being complied with if they're adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3933)|
| 1:05:38| There are probably elements of the plan that you could address if you wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3938)|
| 1:05:43| with regard to the location of the service bays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3943)|
| 1:05:46| and potentially adding a condition about the wooden fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3946)|
| 1:05:50| if you want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3950)|
| 1:05:53| That seemed to be an issue with the community is the location of the service bays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3953)|
| 1:05:57| But as far as seeing what is done by Mr. Cope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3957)|
| 1:06:02| and making sure that that's what's done on the ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3962)|
| 1:06:05| I don't know that council could do that at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3965)|
| 1:06:08| and again, I would defer to the law director for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3968)|
| 1:06:13| Well, the proposal already has it subject to the four conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3973)|
| 1:06:18| and you can see the four conditions that are set out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3978)|
| 1:06:21| and they deal with the issues that you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3981)|
| 1:06:24| But it would not be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3984)|
| 1:06:29| we're probably not going to be able to enforce it down to the drawing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3989)|
| 1:06:32| that's on a particular drawing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3992)|
| 1:06:35| But to have these particular programmatic conditions on it, you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=3995)|
| 1:06:41| You can have those conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4001)|
| 1:06:43| But to say it's going to be brown rather than green or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4003)|
| 1:06:46| it's going to be very difficult,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4006)|
| 1:06:48| and we probably don't have the enforcement capacity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4008)|
| 1:06:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4011)|
| 1:06:53| So I'll take it as submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4013)|
| 1:06:56| I mean, as submitted, that's the way his intentions are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4016)|
| 1:07:00| I'm not a believer that this development of this site as proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4020)|
| 1:07:08| is going to be the linchpin to destroy the whole neighborhood as been presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4028)|
| 1:07:12| I think with access off of Parkside Drive, solely off Parkside Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4032)|
| 1:07:17| exclusively off Parkside Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4037)|
| 1:07:19| with no access to this property off Cogdill Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4039)|
| 1:07:23| it's not going to lead to the detrimental decline that's been proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4043)|
| 1:07:29| What's also allowed in O1 is hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4049)|
| 1:07:33| And you see, as we approved tonight on Pratt Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4053)|
| 1:07:37| we approved a hotel, a two-story Hampton Inn or equivalent thereof,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4057)|
| 1:07:43| on Pratt Road, which is well off of Cedar Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4063)|
| 1:07:50| That's also, and you see right on Cogdill Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4070)|
| 1:07:52| there's another hotel that backs up with no buffer, with no landscape buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4072)|
| 1:07:57| It's right on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4077)|
| 1:07:59| I mean, you see how it's pretty offensive to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4079)|
| 1:08:01| This will be a lot less offensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4081)|
| 1:08:03| Sixty feet with a 15-foot landscape buffer will probably be adequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4083)|
| 1:08:10| I mean, this is a fear of the unknown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4090)|
| 1:08:13| This is a fear of what it's going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4093)|
| 1:08:16| and based on what I see and what's presented here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4096)|
| 1:08:20| I just don't think those fears are founded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4100)|
| 1:08:22| I think it's very applicable on Parkside Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4102)|
| 1:08:26| with a Parkside Drive address and a Parkside Drive entrance exclusively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4106)|
| 1:08:31| And I intend to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4111)|
| 1:08:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4113)|
| 1:08:34| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4114)|
| 1:08:36| Just one question to clarify now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4116)|
| 1:08:38| Mr. Farrell's property was annexed into the city, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4118)|
| 1:08:43| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4123)|
| 1:08:45| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4125)|
| 1:08:46| And is any part of the surrounding neighborhood in the city at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4126)|
| 1:08:51| Any of the surrounding neighborhoods?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4131)|
| 1:08:53| Is it all in the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4133)|
| 1:08:54| None of the residential development is in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4134)|
| 1:08:57| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4137)|
| 1:08:58| None of the residential development is in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4138)|
| 1:09:01| adjoining residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4141)|
| 1:09:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4143)|
| 1:09:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4144)|
| 1:09:05| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4145)|
| 1:09:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4146)|
| 1:09:07| I went back through the e-mails and the phone calls that we've received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4147)|
| 1:09:11| and found they fell into basically four categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4151)|
| 1:09:15| One was the increased traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4155)|
| 1:09:17| Well, Cogdill Road's a dead end, so that was kind of a moot point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4157)|
| 1:09:20| Although I noticed that there is a church and a church camp on Cogdill Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4160)|
| 1:09:27| and there's a law office at the end of Cogdill Road by Parkside Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4167)|
| 1:09:32| The second complaint was the noise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4172)|
| 1:09:35| and MPC again put the condition that there would be no external speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4175)|
| 1:09:40| A third concern out of the e-mails was lighting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4180)|
| 1:09:44| and again there are conditions from MPC and in Mr. Farrell's plan to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4184)|
| 1:09:50| And the fourth concern was the property values would decline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4190)|
| 1:09:55| MPC requires a vegetation barrier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4195)|
| 1:09:58| and in many neighborhoods those kinds of barriers become a kind of woods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4198)|
| 1:10:03| that separates the neighborhood from the adjacent commercial property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4203)|
| 1:10:09| As I drove through the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4209)|
| 1:10:11| I was a little bit concerned that at the corner of Cogdill Road and Land Oaks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4211)|
| 1:10:17| was a very blighted property with 18-inch or higher grass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4217)|
| 1:10:23| and I was a little surprised that the neighbors haven't done something to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4223)|
| 1:10:27| And that is in the county. It's not in the city. Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4227)|
| 1:10:32| So that was a concern that I had too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4232)|
| 1:10:35| I will be supporting the rezoning tonight also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4235)|
| 1:10:39| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4239)|
| 1:10:41| Councilman Della Vopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4241)|
| 1:10:42| Yes, Mayor. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4242)|
| 1:10:44| I want to commend both sides because I think they've both reached out, tried to talk to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4244)|
| 1:10:50| Mr. Farrell has obviously hired some professionals to do a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4250)|
| 1:10:54| and try to take some of the concerns into place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4254)|
| 1:10:57| The neighborhood has been very respectful but protective of their rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4257)|
| 1:11:02| And I'm going to vote against this because I think that these folks have been in a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4262)|
| 1:11:09| where Mr. Farrell came into this property knowing what the zoning was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4269)|
| 1:11:15| what the restrictions were back in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4275)|
| 1:11:18| And I think to change it now is to go back on a promise that everyone relied on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4278)|
| 1:11:24| as they lived in and improved their houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4284)|
| 1:11:27| I think the Cogdiel Road cutoff, that certainly does eliminate some of the problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4287)|
| 1:11:32| And, of course, some of the planning activity of the designers, Mr. Cope and others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4292)|
| 1:11:39| is commendable in that it tries to take the sting out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4299)|
| 1:11:42| But I think this idea that you change the game in the ninth inning, I think, is wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4302)|
| 1:11:48| And I'm going to vote to deny this change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4308)|
| 1:11:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4313)|
| 1:11:54| Thank you. Vice Mayor Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4314)|
| 1:11:56| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4316)|
| 1:11:57| I think one of the things that we need to think about, not only in this particular situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4317)|
| 1:12:02| but in other neighborhoods that we have, is that, as the gentleman said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4322)|
| 1:12:07| and some of us have said, we've got to draw a line somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4327)|
| 1:12:11| And we have a residential area that basically is surrounded by commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4331)|
| 1:12:16| It's surrounded by office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4336)|
| 1:12:18| And if we allow for changes to begin to occur within the neighborhood, where does it stop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4338)|
| 1:12:25| And as the one gentleman said, that right now they know for a fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4345)|
| 1:12:31| that an office building could go there or anything that's in that particular zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4351)|
| 1:12:36| Whereas, as Councilman Della Vopi pointed out, there are a number of issues that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4356)|
| 1:12:41| if we change that to a C6, that could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4361)|
| 1:12:45| In fact, he took some of the things that I was going to say about different areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4365)|
| 1:12:51| different types of uses that could go in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4371)|
| 1:12:54| And I think that that's what we have to watch for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4374)|
| 1:12:57| I mean, light industrial, self-service storage buildings, those types of things that could go in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4377)|
| 1:13:05| And right now the neighborhood knows what could go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4385)|
| 1:13:09| Also, what's interesting is if you go back and look at the 2008 plan that was presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4389)|
| 1:13:15| when the property was annexed, there's really not much difference between that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4395)|
| 1:13:19| and what they showed today in terms of the buffer and in terms of the landscaping and this sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4399)|
| 1:13:25| And if you think about it, that property sat there for eight years and nothing's happened to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4405)|
| 1:13:30| There's been no buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4410)|
| 1:13:32| There's been no, you know, how does the neighborhood know that things are really going to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4412)|
| 1:13:36| or how do we know that there's really going to be a car dealership there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4416)|
| 1:13:40| But I really think the bottom line to what we have to really consider is the fact that if we rezone the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4420)|
| 1:13:48| and go with the C6, then we are allowing for a number of different uses to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4428)|
| 1:13:55| I think we all agree that Mr. Furrow has done, he's a good community person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4435)|
| 1:14:01| He's done a lot of wonderful historic preservation projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4441)|
| 1:14:05| His work that he does is very well maintained and this sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4445)|
| 1:14:09| But I do think that there was an agreement made in 2008, and that agreement should stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4449)|
| 1:14:15| And as MPC staff pointed out, we're not really denying Mr. Furrow the use of his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4455)|
| 1:14:22| We're not really denying him the use of what he wanted back in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4462)|
| 1:14:27| It's just that, as Councilman Della Lope has pointed out, it has, the rules of the game are changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4467)|
| 1:14:35| And that's not what the neighborhood had agreed to originally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4475)|
| 1:14:39| It's not what they're in favor of today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4479)|
| 1:14:41| And really when you see what they're talking about, what I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4481)|
| 1:14:45| the only difference between the conditions that have been put on the property is the fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4485)|
| 1:14:50| In other words, the building still has to be 60 feet away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4490)|
| 1:14:53| There still has to be a buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4493)|
| 1:14:55| Cogdill Road still has to close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4495)|
| 1:14:57| Lighting has to be taken care of, and so have the loudspeakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4497)|
| 1:15:00| So I'd like to make a motion to deny the request and do what the MPC staff recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4500)|
| 1:15:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4508)|
| 1:15:10| There is a motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4510)|
| 1:15:12| Councilman Walsh, do you want to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4512)|
| 1:15:15| Yeah, I'm going to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4515)|
| 1:15:18| I'll make a motion that we, an alternative motion that we make a motion to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4518)|
| 1:15:23| I mean, that's a substitute motion that we approve it as submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4523)|
| 1:15:29| I mean, this is a viable business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4529)|
| 1:15:32| The City of Knoxville is about attracting and developing viable businesses to our tax base| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4532)|
| 1:15:39| and that afford the services of the city that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4539)|
| 1:15:43| And we have a, we certainly have an obligation to try to amend that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4543)|
| 1:15:48| You wouldn't expect Mr. Greave, him to go in there and put in the landscaping buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4548)|
| 1:15:52| until he puts in the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4552)|
| 1:15:53| I mean, that's preposterous to think that he would go in and put the landscaping in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4553)|
| 1:15:56| until he develops the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4556)|
| 1:15:58| He hasn't done any of the site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4558)|
| 1:16:00| He hasn't done any of the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4560)|
| 1:16:02| Since 2008, we've been in a healthy recession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4562)|
| 1:16:04| A lot's changed on Parkside Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4564)|
| 1:16:07| and a lot of properties have been developed a lot more intensely than they were eight years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4567)|
| 1:16:13| So, you know, I just don't think those are good arguments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4573)|
| 1:16:17| I don't see anybody putting in the landscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4577)|
| 1:16:19| The Pratt Road, go back to Pratt Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4579)|
| 1:16:21| Pratt Road is a 01 in a hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4581)|
| 1:16:23| We just approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4583)|
| 1:16:25| And it backs up the residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4585)|
| 1:16:26| There were no concerns about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4586)|
| 1:16:31| And, again, the hotel is pretty intense use in 01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4591)|
| 1:16:39| So it's not just some office building that people only show up five days a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4599)|
| 1:16:43| It can be used 24-7 as a hotel is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4603)|
| 1:16:46| And so you throw out all these horrible things that could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4606)|
| 1:16:50| I mean, there's horrible things that could happen in 01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4610)|
| 1:16:53| I mean, you've got to be considerate of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4613)|
| 1:16:56| So, again, I just don't think the whole world is going to fall in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4616)|
| 1:17:01| given who the developer is, given the site and the information that we've been afforded to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4621)|
| 1:17:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4627)|
| 1:17:08| I have a substitute motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4628)|
| 1:17:10| Was there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4630)|
| 1:17:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4631)|
| 1:17:12| There's a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4632)|
| 1:17:13| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4633)|
| 1:17:14| One of the questions that I have is council has been very concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4634)|
| 1:17:18| and our constituents in the city have been very concerned about the need for sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4638)|
| 1:17:23| and we are looking at funding sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4643)|
| 1:17:26| And this particular property, as an auto dealership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4646)|
| 1:17:30| would generate a tremendous amount of sales tax and property tax revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4650)|
| 1:17:34| and I think that we need to give some thought to that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4654)|
| 1:17:38| The neighborhood is not going to be ignored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4658)|
| 1:17:40| It's not going to be neglected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4660)|
| 1:17:42| It's not going to be thrown to the wolves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4662)|
| 1:17:44| There will be buffers and protections there if this dealership is allowed to come about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4664)|
| 1:17:50| Any property we zone or rezone can always change uses over time, and we have no guarantee any place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4670)|
| 1:17:58| An office building could go in there that has an escort service, and that would be an office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4678)|
| 1:18:04| It would certainly be within the grounds of an office building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4684)|
| 1:18:07| So I think we have to be a little bit realistic sometimes about how we're looking at these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4687)|
| 1:18:15| Vice Mayor Gray?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4695)|
| 1:18:16| With all due respect to my colleagues, I think that, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4696)|
| 1:18:21| there's property out there that is available along Parkside that could be bought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4701)|
| 1:18:25| In fact, even Mr. Ferrell the last time mentioned that there was property on down the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4705)|
| 1:18:29| but it was going to cost gazillions of dollars to buy it, and so he can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4709)|
| 1:18:34| So basically what I think some of you are saying is let's sell out the neighborhood for business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4714)|
| 1:18:39| when there is other opportunities for Mr. Ferrell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4719)|
| 1:18:43| He's got other property that he can purchase down the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4723)|
| 1:18:46| and I think that one of the things that we need to think about is we also need to think about all the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4726)|
| 1:18:53| and all the residents that are in a particular area, whether it's this particular area we're dealing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4733)|
| 1:18:58| or whether it's if I'm dealing with West Hills or Dean Hill or whatever, that you have a neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4738)|
| 1:19:04| you draw a line, and you keep that line where it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4744)|
| 1:19:08| and you realize that what has to happen is you have to protect the different areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4748)|
| 1:19:14| just like we're going to protect what goes along Parkside Drive on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4754)|
| 1:19:18| So I think that in this particular case that the neighbors have worked with Mr. Ferrell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4758)|
| 1:19:25| Granted, they've talked back and forth, but when you get right down to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4765)|
| 1:19:28| the only thing that Mr. Ferrell has agreed to is a fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4768)|
| 1:19:33| Otherwise, what he's talked about is what was agreed in 2008 when they changed it at that particular time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4773)|
| 1:19:40| and I think we just have to be careful that when we rezone a piece of property that we do have to realize what it could be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4780)|
| 1:19:46| and yes, George, there is a hotel adjacent to this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4786)|
| 1:19:50| There could be another one if there's enough property and if there's enough parking and this sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4790)|
| 1:19:54| but I think in this particular situation, I think it's imperative that we as a council maintain the integrity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4794)|
| 1:20:02| of what neighborhoods that we have in this particular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4802)|
| 1:20:06| So I'm certainly in support of the denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4806)|
| 1:20:11| Okay, so right now we have a substitute motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4811)|
| 1:20:17| My counsel, you discussed last time that if you were going to approve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4817)|
| 1:20:21| that it would have to be done on emergency because of the timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4821)|
| 1:20:26| Just as a courtesy, I'm reminding you of that, that you need an amendment to amend your substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4826)|
| 1:20:34| Amend the substitute motion to be read on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4834)|
| 1:20:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4837)|
| 1:20:39| That's really not how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4839)|
| 1:20:41| You've got a substitute motion that's pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4841)|
| 1:20:43| You want to amend the measure to be on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4843)|
| 1:20:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4849)|
| 1:20:50| Amend the measure to be on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4850)|
| 1:20:52| We need to vote on it separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4852)|
| 1:20:54| Let's do that first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4854)|
| 1:20:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4856)|
| 1:20:57| So repeat again what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4857)|
| 1:20:59| Is that your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4859)|
| 1:21:00| I just want to understand procedurally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4860)|
| 1:21:03| If we have a vote to deny this zoning request or the combination of plan and zoning request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4863)|
| 1:21:10| isn't that a vote in favor of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4870)|
| 1:21:12| I mean, we have a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4872)|
| 1:21:14| Now we have battling motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4874)|
| 1:21:16| Doesn't one motion deal with the whole thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4876)|
| 1:21:18| I think if the motion to deny fails, then there still has to be a positive motion to pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4878)|
| 1:21:28| It's the opposite of what normally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4888)|
| 1:21:30| Isn't that correct, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4890)|
| 1:21:32| I'm sorry, I didn't hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4892)|
| 1:21:35| If the motion to deny failed, then there would still need to be an affirmative motion to pass this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4895)|
| 1:21:42| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4902)|
| 1:21:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4903)|
| 1:21:44| You have to have an affirmative to pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4904)|
| 1:21:45| I don't know how that would come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4905)|
| 1:21:46| I'm voting on the motion to pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4906)|
| 1:21:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4907)|
| 1:21:48| We are voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4908)|
| 1:21:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4909)|
| 1:21:50| So you had a motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4910)|
| 1:21:51| You now have a substitute motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4911)|
| 1:21:54| So that's what we're going to vote on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4914)|
| 1:21:56| You vote on the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4916)|
| 1:21:58| And then that was amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4918)|
| 1:21:59| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4919)|
| 1:22:00| You're going to vote on the motion to make an emergency first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4920)|
| 1:22:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4922)|
| 1:22:03| I was going to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4923)|
| 1:22:04| Motion to amend the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4924)|
| 1:22:05| But then next, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4925)|
| 1:22:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4926)|
| 1:22:08| I'm voting on amending the ordinance to be passed on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4928)|
| 1:22:17| That's the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4937)|
| 1:22:18| And then the next vote, whether it wins or loses, the next vote, then, is the substitute motion to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4938)|
| 1:22:26| Well, actually, if it doesn't pass to be amended as emergency, then it fails because it has to be passed on an emergency basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4946)|
| 1:22:35| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4955)|
| 1:22:36| That's technically right because of the timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4956)|
| 1:22:37| I think they're right on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4957)|
| 1:22:39| And it takes six votes to pass it on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4959)|
| 1:22:43| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4963)|
| 1:22:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4965)|
| 1:22:46| That adds a wrinkle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4966)|
| 1:22:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4967)|
| 1:22:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4969)|
| 1:22:50| So we are on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4970)|
| 1:22:52| So that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4972)|
| 1:22:54| We need six votes, then, to pass on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4974)|
| 1:22:56| Which angel is standing on the head of the pen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4976)|
| 1:22:58| Your first vote that you'll take is a motion to make this an emergency measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4978)|
| 1:23:02| That needs six votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4982)|
| 1:23:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4984)|
| 1:23:05| And then if that passes, then you move to the motion to approve, and that would only need five votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4985)|
| 1:23:13| No, it's going to be approved on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4993)|
| 1:23:15| It would have to have six votes, both times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4995)|
| 1:23:17| Both would have to have six votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4997)|
| 1:23:19| Both times?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=4999)|
| 1:23:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5000)|
| 1:23:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5001)|
| 1:23:22| So we need six votes for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5002)|
| 1:23:23| So my motion may never appear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5003)|
| 1:23:25| Your motion may never appear if there are six votes opposed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5005)|
| 1:23:28| Because his is an amendment to my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5008)|
| 1:23:31| No, his is a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5011)|
| 1:23:33| Substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5013)|
| 1:23:34| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5014)|
| 1:23:35| You can withdraw yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5015)|
| 1:23:37| You can withdraw yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5017)|
| 1:23:38| You can do away with your substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5018)|
| 1:23:40| You can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5020)|
| 1:23:41| No, you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5021)|
| 1:23:42| You've got to have an affirmative, you know, you've got to have an affirmative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5022)|
| 1:23:47| I would suggest if the motion to, you know, if we get past the emergency and the motion to approve fails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5027)|
| 1:23:56| that because of what happened to the royal properties matter, that we go ahead and vote on Mr. Greaves' motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5036)|
| 1:24:04| Okay, but what we're doing first, we're voting on the amendment that this measure be passed on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5044)|
| 1:24:14| Does everybody understand that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5054)|
| 1:24:15| Roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5055)|
| 1:24:16| Roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5056)|
| 1:24:17| We'll do it by roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5057)|
| 1:24:21| So repeat once again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5061)|
| 1:24:24| The first vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5064)|
| 1:24:27| Did we have a second on the amendment on emergency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5067)|
| 1:24:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5070)|
| 1:24:31| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5071)|
| 1:24:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5073)|
| 1:24:35| This is for the emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5075)|
| 1:24:37| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5077)|
| 1:24:38| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5078)|
| 1:24:40| Councilman Campbell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5080)|
| 1:24:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5081)|
| 1:24:42| Councilman Dillon-Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5082)|
| 1:24:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5083)|
| 1:24:44| Vice Mayor Greaves?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5084)|
| 1:24:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5085)|
| 1:24:48| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5088)|
| 1:24:49| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5089)|
| 1:24:53| Pass means yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5093)|
| 1:24:54| Pass means skip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5094)|
| 1:24:56| Pass means to skip, and I can come back and vote if I choose to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5096)|
| 1:25:01| Councilman Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5101)|
| 1:25:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5102)|
| 1:25:04| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5104)|
| 1:25:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5105)|
| 1:25:07| Councilman Steyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5107)|
| 1:25:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5108)|
| 1:25:09| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5109)|
| 1:25:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5110)|
| 1:25:13| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5113)|
| 1:25:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5114)|
| 1:25:18| Okay, so the motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5118)|
| 1:25:23| Six to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5123)|
| 1:25:24| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5124)|
| 1:25:25| Six to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5125)|
| 1:25:26| Okay, so that means do we still do the substitute procedurally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5126)|
| 1:25:34| I think we're back on Vice Mayor Greaves' motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5134)|
| 1:25:37| Procedurally, we're still on the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5137)|
| 1:25:42| But it will be a futile motion because of the 120-day limit for doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5142)|
| 1:25:51| because then it would only come back on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5151)|
| 1:25:53| It would be too late, and it would already be denied by operation of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5153)|
| 1:25:56| So probably the best, most procedurally correct thing to happen here that would work better for everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5156)|
| 1:26:03| is if you were to withdraw that substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5163)|
| 1:26:06| That's what I'm about right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5166)|
| 1:26:08| I'm about procedural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5168)|
| 1:26:10| Okay, so we've withdrawn the substitute motion, and now we are on the motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5170)|
| 1:26:16| And we do have a motion and a second on that, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5176)|
| 1:26:18| And you only need five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5178)|
| 1:26:20| We need five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5180)|
| 1:26:22| Do we need a roll call on that or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5182)|
| 1:26:25| Let's do a roll call just to make it easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5185)|
| 1:26:28| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5188)|
| 1:26:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5189)|
| 1:26:31| This is the motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5191)|
| 1:26:34| We don't want the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5194)|
| 1:26:36| That's what it means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5196)|
| 1:26:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5197)|
| 1:26:39| Councilman Campin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5199)|
| 1:26:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5200)|
| 1:26:42| Councilman Dela Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5202)|
| 1:26:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5203)|
| 1:26:44| Vice Mayor Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5204)|
| 1:26:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5205)|
| 1:26:46| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5206)|
| 1:26:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5207)|
| 1:26:49| Councilman Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5209)|
| 1:26:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5210)|
| 1:26:51| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5211)|
| 1:26:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5212)|
| 1:26:53| Councilman Steyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5213)|
| 1:26:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5214)|
| 1:26:55| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5215)|
| 1:26:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5216)|
| 1:26:58| Okay, the motion to deny is approved 6-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5218)|
| 1:27:04| And that was 9-B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5224)|
| 1:27:06| So now we move on to 9-C and D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5226)|
| 1:27:10| We're 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5230)|
| 1:27:11| I mean 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5231)|
| 1:27:12| Sorry, 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5232)|
| 1:27:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5233)|
| 1:27:14| That was right in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5234)|
| 1:27:18| Still voting on this, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5238)|
| 1:27:20| Isn't that moot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5240)|
| 1:27:21| I'll leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5241)|
| 1:27:22| Oh, we don't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5242)|
| 1:27:24| Thank you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5244)|
| 1:27:26| Because the 12-B was denied, then the next two are moot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5246)|
| 1:27:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5251)|
| 1:27:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5252)|
| 1:27:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5253)|
| 1:27:34| So, council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5254)|
| 1:27:35| Y'all made that easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5255)|
| 1:27:37| We're now to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5257)|
| 1:27:40| So we do have, I'm going to see, we actually have seven people who have signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5260)|
| 1:27:46| We typically only have, we have 30 minutes by council rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5266)|
| 1:27:50| So let me see if everybody is in fact here who signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5270)|
| 1:27:54| When I call your name, if you would please let me see that you're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5274)|
| 1:27:58| Ted Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5278)|
| 1:28:00| Is Ted Ward here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5280)|
| 1:28:04| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5284)|
| 1:28:06| I don't see Ted Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5286)|
| 1:28:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5288)|
| 1:28:09| Then we're down to six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5289)|
| 1:28:10| So we will proceed as usual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5290)|
| 1:28:13| Mr. Presley, you're up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5293)|
| 1:28:15| And as you know, you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5295)|
| 1:28:17| And thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5297)|
| 1:28:19| State your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5299)|

| 1:28:24| I am an alcoholic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5304)|
| 1:28:26| My address is 1134 Glade Hill Drive, 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5306)|
| 1:28:31| Knoxville is the racist city I ever lived in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5311)|
| 1:28:34| From Miami to New York City to all over Texas and all over California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5314)|
| 1:28:39| Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said that Alabama Governor George Wallace is the racist governor in his lifetime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5319)|
| 1:28:47| I say Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam is the racist governor in my lifetime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5327)|
| 1:28:52| He refused to meet President Obama when he came to Nashville, saying he had other business matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5332)|
| 1:28:58| I will continue bringing this newspaper to city council and to the county commission meetings every month to prove how racist this city is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5338)|
| 1:29:07| The next racist problem I had was July 21st at 1233 at the intersection of 16th Street and Law Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5347)|
| 1:29:18| when a Knox County sheriff's officer stopped in the middle of a three-way stop sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5358)|
| 1:29:23| put her police lights on, and ran to my car and threatened me in her road rage sheriff uniform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5363)|
| 1:29:32| I pulled my car over and called the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5372)|
| 1:29:36| His secretary transferred me to the Office of Poor Standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5376)|
| 1:29:40| A sergeant told me they will have her supervisor talk to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5380)|
| 1:29:45| I called the city and the county mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5385)|
| 1:29:48| I then called the governor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5388)|
| 1:29:50| I called the White House and they transferred me to the Department of Justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5390)|
| 1:29:54| I called Knoxville FBI office and left a message at the media extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5394)|
| 1:29:59| I called the FBI and told them in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5399)|
| 1:30:02| I then went to my doctor visit at Fort Sanders and I had to stay an extra hour because of high blood pressure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5402)|
| 1:30:10| I never had high blood pressure in my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5410)|
| 1:30:13| I called to J.J. Jones' office and his secretary told me that they have a thousand employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5413)|
| 1:30:20| and they don't have time to look for this officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5420)|
| 1:30:23| The Office of Poor Standards told me they don't have a female officer in unmarked SUVs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5423)|
| 1:30:29| I filed a complaint with Senator Alexander, Senator Corker, and Congressman Duncan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5429)|
| 1:30:36| for them to fax my complaint to the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5436)|
| 1:30:41| So I don't be surprised when they start investigating you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5441)|
| 1:30:46| I called WATE, Don Dare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5446)|
| 1:30:49| I called TBI and they told me that they can't investigate until the district attorney asks them to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5449)|
| 1:30:56| I asked the DA's office, can I file a report as someone impersonating a sheriff's officer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5456)|
| 1:31:06| And this was two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5466)|
| 1:31:09| I haven't heard from the DA's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5469)|
| 1:31:11| Muhammad Ali's small picture on this Sunday's paper will continue to be a racist problem for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5471)|
| 1:31:18| That guy Duane Greaves saw this paper close up and he had to put his glasses on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5478)|
| 1:31:25| to find Muhammad Ali's picture on this front page of this Sunday's paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5485)|
| 1:31:30| Muhammad Ali is dead, but this newspaper will not die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5490)|
| 1:31:35| This road rage officer will do it again and I wish she would have killed me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5495)|
| 1:31:40| Then you would have known who this officer is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5500)|
| 1:31:43| I'm writing, I'm willing to die for justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5503)|
| 1:31:48| When you all started this meeting, I walked out and threw a Bible in the trash can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5508)|
| 1:31:53| because after attending churches in Knoxville, the Church of God is bad mouthing the Baptist church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5513)|
| 1:32:00| and they are bad mouthing President Obama, saying his religion is killing our babies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5520)|
| 1:32:06| and that the liberals are spending our country's money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5526)|
| 1:32:09| I gave up on all churches and my uncle and brother-in-law and a friend of mine are pastors in churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5529)|
| 1:32:17| It's sad that I have to feel this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5537)|
| 1:32:19| I was watching 60 Minutes this past Sunday and they had 12 lawyers bragging on how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5539)|
| 1:32:25| they will money launder billions of dollars because lawyers run America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5545)|
| 1:32:33| You have 50 seconds, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5553)|
| 1:32:34| They said that the laws and the lawyers have their way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5554)|
| 1:32:38| I learned by coming to these meetings that local, state, and federal politics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5558)|
| 1:32:42| that you all have lied to us so many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5562)|
| 1:32:46| They say Hillary Clinton lied about some emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5566)|
| 1:32:49| They have lied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5569)|
| 1:32:50| They all have to lie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5570)|
| 1:32:52| Who tells the best lies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5572)|
| 1:32:54| We're aware of local, state, and federal elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5574)|
| 1:32:56| I voted in local elections in 7th, 8th, and 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5576)|
| 1:33:01| I asked, do we want to retain or replace state Supreme Court judges?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5581)|
| 1:33:06| It didn't say whether they are Republican or Democrat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5586)|
| 1:33:11| I asked the Knox County elections director and he told me that the election is set up that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5591)|
| 1:33:18| I told him the election is a scam, like KUB is a scam, like TVA is a scam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5598)|
| 1:33:24| Land Rover came here tonight and it's a scam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5604)|
| 1:33:28| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5608)|
| 1:33:29| Your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5609)|
| 1:33:30| And you people, and Brenda Palmer, you are the worst person on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5610)|
| 1:33:33| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5613)|
| 1:33:34| Your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5614)|
| 1:33:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5616)|
| 1:33:37| Next is Drew Crickow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5617)|
| 1:33:39| Mr. Crickow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5619)|
| 1:33:49| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5629)|
| 1:33:50| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5630)|
| 1:33:52| My name is Andrew Crickow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5632)|
| 1:33:53| I am currently still homeless in Knoxville, co-facilitator of the Knoxville Homeless Collective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5633)|
| 1:33:59| and affiliated with the East Tennessee Peace and Justice Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5639)|
| 1:34:03| It's been a while since we've been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5643)|
| 1:34:05| We are still working on our Homeless Bill of Rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5645)|
| 1:34:08| We still would like to meet with all of you at one point or another, hopefully sooner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5648)|
| 1:34:14| to have some sort of workshop or an agenda that we can get on to get this discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5654)|
| 1:34:19| to get it passed so that the homeless community is not being profiled and harassed anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5659)|
| 1:34:26| There are still continued arrests for PI when there is no public intoxication whatsoever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5666)|
| 1:34:33| and it's a crying shame that statistics show that over 40% of all PI arrests in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5673)|
| 1:34:41| are targeted towards the homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5681)|
| 1:34:44| We continue to work on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5684)|
| 1:34:46| We continue to speak to other people in other cities who have their Bill of Rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5686)|
| 1:34:52| to protect their homeless communities, asking them how they got it passed, what they had to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5692)|
| 1:34:59| We're getting advice from them, and we will be implementing that with our Bill of Rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5699)|
| 1:35:04| to present it to you, and all it's going to take is just one time for all of you to sit with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5704)|
| 1:35:11| to discuss this to get this finalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5711)|
| 1:35:14| We've had repeated requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5714)|
| 1:35:17| We have had several meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5717)|
| 1:35:19| We've been told no, and we are going to draw a line in the sand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5719)|
| 1:35:23| This is as far as we back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5723)|
| 1:35:25| We're not backing up anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5725)|
| 1:35:27| Enough is enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5727)|
| 1:35:29| Something needs to be done in this city before it gets any worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5729)|
| 1:35:34| Camps are still being raided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5734)|
| 1:35:36| Camps are still being plowed under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5736)|
| 1:35:38| Arrests are still being made for criminal trespass because we don't have the space to go anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5738)|
| 1:35:46| One of the other statistics is that a very generous number was given to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5746)|
| 1:35:50| that there was over 750 homeless in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5750)|
| 1:35:54| Those are the ones that they were able to find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5754)|
| 1:35:56| Those are the ones that are registered to the HMIS program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5756)|
| 1:36:00| Those do not cover everyone who doesn't have an HMIS card and was not in that census.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5760)|
| 1:36:07| Our estimates are anywhere between 800 to 1,200 homeless a night in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5767)|
| 1:36:13| There's roughly 450 or more beds in Knoxville to help house the homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5773)|
| 1:36:20| Where do the rest go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5780)|
| 1:36:22| Where are we supposed to sleep?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5782)|
| 1:36:24| Where are we supposed to lay our head at night in safety to rest to be able to proceed the next day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5784)|
| 1:36:30| to try to get off the streets, to try to get a job, to try to get these helps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5790)|
| 1:36:35| that the city prides itself in saying that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5795)|
| 1:36:39| But all these helps, all these programs, all these resources do not apply to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5799)|
| 1:36:45| I am one who these resources do not apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5805)|
| 1:36:49| I've been to VMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5809)|
| 1:36:52| I was actually able to get case management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5812)|
| 1:36:55| I told them my situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5815)|
| 1:36:57| She looked at me and gave me a shrug and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5817)|
| 1:37:00| I don't know what to do for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5820)|
| 1:37:03| This is someone who is trained to help people, to help the homeless, to help the less fortunate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5823)|
| 1:37:08| to get them jobs, to get them housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5828)|
| 1:37:11| And if this trained professional doesn't know what to do, then what am I supposed to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5831)|
| 1:37:17| Where do I go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5837)|

| 1:37:20| What am I supposed to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5840)|
| 1:37:23| What are the others supposed to do that are in similar situations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5843)|
| 1:37:27| It doesn't even have to be a criminal history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5847)|
| 1:37:29| It could just be a certain set of circumstances where they were left in a bad way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5849)|
| 1:37:33| And because of their present condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5853)|
| 1:37:36| they're denied certain abilities to be able to get any kind of help or anything like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5856)|
| 1:37:43| because of the situation they're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5863)|
| 1:37:45| We have several with us here tonight that will be telling you their personal stories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5865)|
| 1:37:50| of what they've had to experience being homeless in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5870)|
| 1:37:53| what they're experiencing now trying to get out of the situation that they're in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5873)|
| 1:37:59| that these programs, these helps, these resources do not help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5879)|
| 1:38:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5884)|

| 1:38:07| Peggy Sue Morrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5887)|
| 1:38:15| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5895)|
| 1:38:21| And thank you very much for allowing me to speak on behalf of the homeless and our plight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5901)|

| 1:38:45| we the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5925)|
| 1:38:51| ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5931)|
| 1:38:56| promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5936)|
| 1:39:05| In the Bill of Rights, Amendment 1 states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5945)|
| 1:39:08| Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5948)|
| 1:39:12| or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridge the freedom of speech or of the press| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5952)|

| 1:39:41| No warrant shall be issued but upon providental cause supported by oath or affirmation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5981)|
| 1:39:48| and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons and things to be seized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5988)|
| 1:39:55| This amendment has already been violated against us homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=5995)|
| 1:40:00| so we're not being protected enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6000)|
| 1:40:05| I, as a homeless person, have had the police with the city of Knoxville behind them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6005)|
| 1:40:11| have been harassing me, moving me everywhere, taking all my belongings, my tent, my medicines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6011)|
| 1:40:18| my ID, my documents, and even my walker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6018)|
| 1:40:23| The police told me that I have three choices, to go to CARM, go to jail, or get a ticket out of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6023)|
| 1:40:31| Yes, CARM can be a source if you like being in jail and treated as a subhuman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6031)|
| 1:40:42| Some people are banned from there, so that's not an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6042)|
| 1:40:47| No one wants to be in jail, and the ticket out of the county is just a ploy to get us out of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6047)|
| 1:40:53| and the county they send us to, then that city sends us back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6053)|
| 1:40:58| The police have even threatened the church groups who try to help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6058)|
| 1:41:03| They continue on a daily basis to hunt us down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6063)|
| 1:41:06| I was living up in a wooded area, up high and deep, to be hidden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6066)|
| 1:41:11| I had to crawl through a hole to get up the hill to hide from the police,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6071)|
| 1:41:15| and when it rained, I had to crawl through the mud just to get up that hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6075)|
| 1:41:21| The police found it anyway, and took everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6081)|
| 1:41:24| My tent, my bedding, my medicine, my papers, my cookware, my clothes, and even my food and water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6084)|
| 1:41:32| When I asked the police where I'm to go, I quote him saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6092)|
| 1:41:39| I don't care where you go, but you're not staying here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6099)|
| 1:41:42| Even when we are on private property, they evict us, even if the property owner didn't even request it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6102)|
| 1:41:47| Sometimes they give you a notice, and other times they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6107)|
| 1:41:50| We have spaces here in Knoxville, they have abandoned buildings on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6110)|
| 1:41:54| They've got open space, it's owed by the city, that could be used for the homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6114)|
| 1:42:01| You have dog parks, why is there no place for the homeless, who are human beings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6121)|
| 1:42:08| Mayor, you came back from China, you were quoted in the News Sentinel, it says that we all are a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6128)|
| 1:42:14| Where do the homeless fit in this community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6134)|
| 1:42:19| And I would like to present a few quotes by Thomas Pink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6139)|
| 1:42:23| You have one minute, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6143)|
| 1:42:27| A long habit of thinking of a thing wrong gives a superficial appearance of right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6147)|
| 1:42:32| Government, even in its best state, is but a necessary evil in its worst state, an intolerable one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6152)|
| 1:42:40| And the next quote applies to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6160)|
| 1:42:43| Tis the business of little minds to shrink, but whose heart is firm, and whose conscience approves his conduct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6163)|
| 1:42:48| and will pursue his principles to death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6168)|
| 1:42:51| The homeless will not let our issues die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6171)|
| 1:42:54| A quote from Patrick Henry says, give me liberty or give me death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6174)|
| 1:42:58| Is that what the city of Knoxville wants, for us just to disappear or die?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6178)|
| 1:43:03| And last but not least, all we ask for as a homeless collective is to sit down in an informal or formal meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6183)|
| 1:43:10| to discuss the Homeless Bill of Rights, because we are being treated as a separate class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6190)|
| 1:43:15| and our rights are not being protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6195)|
| 1:43:18| This is because we have been denied housing and existing space for us that is safe and secure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6198)|
| 1:43:25| And I ask you, where do you propose for us to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6205)|
| 1:43:29| Thank you so much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6209)|
| 1:43:31| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6211)|
| 1:43:35| Next is Scotty Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6215)|
| 1:43:55| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6235)|
| 1:43:56| Please state your name and address for the record, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6236)|
| 1:43:59| My name is Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6239)|
| 1:44:00| I am formerly homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6240)|
| 1:44:05| I am currently living on a porch that I will not tell you where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6245)|
| 1:44:08| I've been homeless for about five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6248)|
| 1:44:10| Within the past year, I have been evicted and moved from camp to camp, and that's about five times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6250)|
| 1:44:17| I am barred from car, have previously been denied housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6257)|
| 1:44:22| I was told there was a six-month to a year waiting period to access housing through the BMC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6262)|
| 1:44:30| which is their line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6270)|
| 1:44:33| It's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6273)|
| 1:44:34| I've tried, and it takes less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6274)|
| 1:44:37| I have no criminal record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6277)|
| 1:44:39| Currently, I have no other choice but to camp because I have nowhere to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6279)|
| 1:44:43| The last time I was evicted, a cop on site asked me where I was from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6283)|
| 1:44:50| and offered me a bus ticket out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6290)|
| 1:44:54| My question is, you give me a bus pass, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6294)|
| 1:44:59| For one, you give me a bus pass out of here, what am I supposed to survive on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6299)|
| 1:45:02| I have no money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6302)|
| 1:45:03| I have no job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6303)|
| 1:45:04| What am I supposed to survive on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6304)|
| 1:45:08| It's a bunch of BS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6308)|
| 1:45:13| I don't know who would pay for the ticket or for that ticket,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6313)|
| 1:45:17| but the city is funding bus tickets to the homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6317)|
| 1:45:20| That looks to me like the city is intentionally running us out like we're a burden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6320)|
| 1:45:25| which is not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6325)|
| 1:45:27| I'm tired of being run around from place to place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6327)|
| 1:45:31| I'm tired of being harassed because I'm homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6331)|
| 1:45:35| We deserve a place to exist without being treated like second-rate citizens or diseased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6335)|
| 1:45:42| We don't deserve to be treated like a disease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6342)|
| 1:45:47| That needs to be eradicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6347)|
| 1:45:49| We urge the city to sit down with us and talk to us about the Homeless Bill of Rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6349)|
| 1:45:55| We at least deserve that much respect to be taken seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6355)|
| 1:46:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6360)|
| 1:46:01| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6361)|
| 1:46:08| Jennifer Graves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6368)|
| 1:46:19| Thank you for being here, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6379)|
| 1:46:20| I am Becky Swanson, and I am representing Jennifer Graves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6380)|
| 1:46:25| I live on 824 Easy Street, Knoxville, and I am a housewife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6385)|
| 1:46:33| I moved here four years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6393)|
| 1:46:35| I met Jennifer and her children and found out she was homeless living in her car with these four kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6395)|
| 1:46:45| And I get kind of emotional about it because these people affect me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6405)|
| 1:46:53| and I want to see them helped, and I see that there's no help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6413)|
| 1:46:58| I've called shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6418)|
| 1:46:59| They're full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6419)|
| 1:47:01| I've called different people that have said that she cannot come in because she is sanctioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6421)|
| 1:47:10| because she missed a couple appointments and missed a phone call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6430)|
| 1:47:15| I could understand if she was violent or if she was a drug addict,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6435)|
| 1:47:20| but these kids right here should tell us something is wrong, something is definitely wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6440)|
| 1:47:26| and we need a place for these people to go where they will not be harassed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6446)|
| 1:47:31| And it benefits us, too, because they're going to be out of everybody's way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6451)|
| 1:47:37| but they need a place where they can gather the ones that can't make it to the shelters at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6457)|
| 1:47:44| There's 300 to 400 of them, and they're living on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6464)|
| 1:47:48| These little ones sometimes spend the night in the car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6468)|
| 1:47:51| You know how dangerous it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6471)|
| 1:47:53| She has no choice but to try to foster her children out, and I don't want to see it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6473)|
| 1:48:02| I think this family should stay together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6482)|
| 1:48:05| I think there should be people here to help her and her children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6485)|
| 1:48:09| She's been on the housing list for forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6489)|
| 1:48:14| My heart just breaks for these kids, and you saw how we were trying to wrangle them in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6494)|
| 1:48:20| and it's so hard, and I tell you what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6500)|
| 1:48:23| I commend her for taking care of these kids under the conditions she's been living in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6503)|
| 1:48:28| because I tell you I could not do it myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6508)|
| 1:48:32| There's no way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6512)|
| 1:48:34| And these people, they are people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6514)|
| 1:48:37| They once had lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6517)|
| 1:48:39| They're trying to currently get their lives back, and we need to fight on their behalf,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6519)|
| 1:48:43| and I know that you all have been working very hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6523)|
| 1:48:47| I've read articles about you, Mrs. Mayer, and I just commend you for that too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6527)|
| 1:48:52| because I know you're trying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6532)|
| 1:48:54| I know you are, but for the people who don't get in the shelters at night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6534)|

| 1:52:50| This cannot be true because the guidelines for the overlay extension have not yet been written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6770)|

| 1:52:59| Nevertheless, the new overlay will require new guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160830?start=6779)|
