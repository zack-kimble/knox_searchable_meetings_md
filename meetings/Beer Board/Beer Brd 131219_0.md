| 0:00:16| Councilman Steyer. Here. Councilman Wallace. Here. Thank you. Do I have a motion to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131219?start=16)|
| 0:00:22| the minutes? So moved. Second. All those in favor? Aye. Minutes approved. Just a reminder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131219?start=22)|
| 0:00:30| that if we have something that we defer to a later date, if you'll pass all your paperwork| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131219?start=30)|
| 0:00:36| around to Ms. Day, she'll recycle it for us and we'll save some trees. When I call the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131219?start=36)|
| 0:00:42| name of the business applying for a permit, come to the podium, state your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131219?start=42)|
| 0:00:47| for the record. The first one is Chalmers Grill and Night Lounge. Lisa Brown. Chalmers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131219?start=47)|
| 0:01:00| Grill and Night Lounge. I move we move this to the end of the meeting. OK. I have a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131219?start=60)|
| 0:01:11| and a second. All in favor? Aye. Thank you. Fresh Mart and Deli has withdrawn their application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131219?start=71)|
| 0:01:23| We need to have a vote on whether or not they're allowed to withdraw. Do I hear a motion? So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131219?start=83)|
| 0:01:29| moved. And I have a second. All those in favor of Fresh Mart and Deli withdrawing? Aye. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131219?start=89)|
| 0:01:35| you. What happens if we don't have a motion? They're still gone, right? Well, we'll just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131219?start=95)|
| 0:01:40| keep calling their names. Formalizing it, I see. We're going to toss this, right? OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131219?start=100)|
| 0:01:45| We can toss that one because they won't be, a different group will be back if they want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131219?start=105)|
| 0:01:49| to do this. All right. Scruffy City Hall has two applications. One is for on and off premise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131219?start=109)|
| 0:01:55| sale and the other is for the manufacturer distributor. The on and off premise is one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131219?start=115)|
| 0:02:02| we can deal with tonight, but the manufacturer distributor is not one we can deal with because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131219?start=122)|
| 0:02:08| council has not had the second reading and or approval of the manufacturing ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131219?start=128)|
| 0:02:15| So I'm going to, after we deal with the first one, the on and off premise, I'm going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131219?start=135)|
| 0:02:20| ask that we defer that until March because by that time we will either have an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131219?start=140)|
| 0:02:27| or we won't and we'll be ready to, they'll be able to move forward. So the first one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131219?start=147)|
| 0:02:32| is Scruffy City Hall. If you'll give us your name and address, please. Bernadette West,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131219?start=152)|
| 0:02:38| 32 Market Square. All right. Thank you. Sergeant Hunter is ill tonight, so we have Lt. Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131219?start=158)|
| 0:02:46| No applicable record. Ms. Dyer. We need a building inspection approval, fire inspection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131219?start=166)|
| 0:02:51| approval and health department approval. OK. Do I hear a motion? Move to approve pending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131219?start=171)|
| 0:02:57| final documentation. Second. OK. I'm sorry, Councilman Dela Volpe. I notice my document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131219?start=177)|
| 0:03:05| here says it's OK, but what about the All Souls Church within 266 feet? It was both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131219?start=185)|
| 0:03:12| for on premise and off premise is the way I saw it. We have addressed that before, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131219?start=192)|
| 0:03:17| I think that Mr. Frost can remind us. There's a specific exemption or a shorter distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131219?start=197)|
| 0:03:23| requirement that had this been in, say, for sake of argument, Chapman Highway, the distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131219?start=203)|
| 0:03:29| requirement would have been issued, but for this location, CBID, it's OK. OK. Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131219?start=209)|
| 0:03:35| sir. Thank you. Any other comments or questions? All right. Do I have a motion? We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131219?start=215)|
| 0:03:41| All right. All those in favor? Aye. Thank you. Now, the second one we need to vote on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131219?start=221)|
| 0:03:46| is their application for a manufacturing permit, but I'm going to move that we defer that to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131219?start=226)|
| 0:03:51| March. All those in favor? Aye. March. Second. Yes. Councilman Dela Volpe. Do we think we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131219?start=231)|
| 0:04:00| have an ordinance before then, or we just don't know? Well, the second reading is coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131219?start=240)|
| 0:04:03| up in January. Why not move it to February? Well, because there's another step that perhaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131219?start=243)|
| 0:04:09| they'll have to do, and they're not going to have their equipment in place. Oh, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131219?start=249)|
| 0:04:13| have to go to MPC first? Yes. And their equipment won't be in place until April. That answers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131219?start=253)|
| 0:04:17| the question. They're good. I've talked with them. They're good. OK. I'm good. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131219?start=257)|
| 0:04:20| So we have a motion and a second. All those in favor of deferring this to March? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131219?start=260)|
| 0:04:27| Thank you. And that date in March is March the 18th, the day after St. Patrick's Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131219?start=267)|
| 0:04:31| OK. Thank you very much. Bye-bye. OK. The next one that we have is... What is it? Smoke| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131219?start=271)|
| 0:04:41| and Hog has withdrawn, hasn't it? Smoke and Hog. And they have withdrawn their request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131219?start=281)|
| 0:04:48| So now we need to go back to... Oh. OK. We do need to vote on the withdrawal from Smoke| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131219?start=288)|
| 0:04:54| and Hog. Do I have a motion? So moved. Second? Aye. All those in favor? Aye. All right. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131219?start=294)|
| 0:05:00| you. Now, let's go back to Chalmers Grill and Night Lounge. Lisa Brown. Oh, she just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131219?start=300)|
| 0:05:09| got in here. Good news. If you'll give us your name and address, please. Yes. My address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131219?start=309)|
| 0:05:16| is 513 17th Street. OK. North 17th Street. All right. Thank you. What about the records| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131219?start=316)|
| 0:05:26| check, Lieutenant Williams? No applicable record. Ms. Dyer? We need a copy of the sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131219?start=326)|
| 0:05:31| tax registration, a copy of a certificate of zoning from MPC, building inspection approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131219?start=331)|
| 0:05:37| and health department approval. OK. So those are all outside of her control. And she did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131219?start=337)|
| 0:05:42| complete the task class today. I think it indicated earlier that she had not. So do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131219?start=342)|
| 0:05:46| I have a motion for this? Move to approve pending final documentation. Second. All those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131219?start=346)|
| 0:05:52| in favor? Aye. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Anyone have anything else for the beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131219?start=352)|
| 0:05:58| board? There is an addendum and that has all been resolved. They will be picking up their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131219?start=358)|
| 0:06:06| permit tomorrow morning, bright and early. So we don't need to do anything. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131219?start=366)|
| 0:06:14| Any more business before the beer board? Seeing no other business, we are adjourned at 6.06.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd131219?start=374)|
