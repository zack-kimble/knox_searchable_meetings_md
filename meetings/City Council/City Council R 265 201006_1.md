| 2:17:23| Next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8243)|
| 2:17:25| 12C is an ordinance to amend chapter 20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8245)|
| 2:17:27| article three, sections 20-52 and 20-61| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8247)|
| 2:17:32| of the Knoxville City Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8252)|
| 2:17:34| smoking on the grounds of city-owned playgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8254)|
| 2:17:37| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8257)|
| 2:17:39| Motion made to approve by Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8259)|
| 2:17:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8262)|
| 2:17:43| Seconded by Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8263)|
| 2:17:46| Just wanted to say, Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8266)|
| 2:17:48| I'm really excited to see this ordinance on here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8268)|
| 2:17:51| This is designed to keep the health and well-being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8271)|
| 2:17:53| of our children a top priority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8273)|
| 2:17:55| and to make sure they can play in a smoke-free environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8275)|
| 2:17:58| So I hope you'll support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8278)|
| 2:18:00| I also want to give a special shout out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8280)|
| 2:18:02| to State Senator Richard Briggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8282)|
| 2:18:04| who sponsored the bill statewide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8284)|
| 2:18:06| giving cities and counties the authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8286)|
| 2:18:08| to ban smoking on playgrounds that we own or operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8288)|
| 2:18:12| Vice Mayor McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8292)|
| 2:18:14| Yes, Mayor, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8294)|
| 2:18:16| Mayor, I also want to take this opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8296)|
| 2:18:18| to not only recognize Senator Richard Briggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8298)|
| 2:18:20| but also the students at Green Magnet School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8300)|
| 2:18:24| Three years ago, they actually did a presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8304)|
| 2:18:27| Myself and Senator Briggs were in attendance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8307)|
| 2:18:30| and they did a presentation and also a play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8310)|
| 2:18:33| advocating for smoking to be taken out of the playgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8313)|
| 2:18:38| And so I'm sure that those students have gone on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8318)|
| 2:18:41| to other schools by Magnet more than likely by this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8321)|
| 2:18:45| But I just want to say kudos to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8325)|
| 2:18:48| because they had that foresight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8328)|
| 2:18:49| and also their administration there at Green School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8329)|
| 2:18:52| to help the children learn more about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8332)|
| 2:18:54| the negative effects of smoking on their health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8334)|
| 2:18:58| and for them to advocate for this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8338)|
| 2:19:00| And so I hope that council will approve this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8340)|
| 2:19:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8344)|
| 2:19:06| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8346)|
| 2:19:06| Any more comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8346)|
| 2:19:08| Council Member Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8348)|
| 2:19:09| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8349)|
| 2:19:12| Is this ban limited to playgrounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8352)|
| 2:19:15| or entire public parks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8355)|
| 2:19:19| Director Ely, could you address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8359)|
| 2:19:24| I think it's playgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8364)|
| 2:19:25| Yeah, but yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8365)|
| 2:19:28| It is just playgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8368)|
| 2:19:31| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8371)|
| 2:19:32| It is just playgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8372)|
| 2:19:33| Parks, we were having a hard time doing the entire park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8373)|
| 2:19:37| So we're doing anything that's kids centric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8377)|
| 2:19:39| So things around playgrounds would be our answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8379)|
| 2:19:41| And Charles, I know you wanted to probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8381)|
| 2:19:43| speak to part of that too, Charles Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8383)|
| 2:19:46| Right, because the state legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8386)|
| 2:19:48| really only gave us authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8388)|
| 2:19:50| to prohibit smoking on playgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8390)|
| 2:19:53| They didn't give us the authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8393)|
| 2:19:55| to prohibit smoking on all parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8395)|
| 2:19:58| So we have to only do what the state allows us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8398)|
| 2:20:02| And so would that mean that they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8402)|
| 2:20:07| touching the playground equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8407)|
| 2:20:08| or what is defined as the playground?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8408)|
| 2:20:12| We'll have to designate which is the playground area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8412)|
| 2:20:18| So it will be designated by signage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8418)|
| 2:20:22| Yes, we will have signage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8422)|
| 2:20:24| and we're working on the signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8424)|
| 2:20:25| I think that's kind of outlined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8425)|
| 2:20:27| in Senator Briggs in his law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8427)|
| 2:20:29| is that signage will be put up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8429)|
| 2:20:31| So right now what we have is right outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8431)|
| 2:20:33| the border of a playground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8433)|
| 2:20:34| We put up young lungs at play signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8434)|
| 2:20:37| so that we can basically say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8437)|
| 2:20:38| that is the border of the playground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8438)|
| 2:20:40| And again, I work with the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8440)|
| 2:20:42| but that's where we have normal signs now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8442)|
| 2:20:45| but we'll put up additional signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8445)|
| 2:20:47| or different signs as this goes into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8447)|
| 2:20:51| And what type of violation is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8451)|
| 2:20:56| What would be the penalty for this violation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8456)|
| 2:20:59| It would be a misdemeanor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8459)|
| 2:21:00| like any other violation of state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8460)|
| 2:21:04| A city ordinance, you mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8464)|
| 2:21:07| If you violate the state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8467)|
| 2:21:10| then it would be a misdemeanor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8470)|
| 2:21:12| It would be a misdemeanor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8472)|
| 2:21:14| but limited to a fine of $50 if it's in city court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8474)|
| 2:21:18| if you're talking about a violation of city ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8478)|
| 2:21:20| Any further comments or questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8480)|

| 2:22:30| will second, but I have some discussion. Okay, the motion has been made by Vice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8550)|
| 2:22:35| Mayor McKenzie, seconded by Councilmember Ryder. Ms. Ryder? Okay, I would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8555)|
| 2:22:39| discuss a motion to amend that I have discussed with Ms. Brooks. I want to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8559)|
| 2:22:47| first I appreciate the Ms. Welch and Ms. Brooks for the amount of time that we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8567)|
| 2:22:55| worked on this. I know Council got an example of where this came into play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8575)|
| 2:23:00| with an item that's coming up on a future Planning Commission meeting where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8580)|
| 2:23:05| some amendments where the community was notified because it's a previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8585)|
| 2:23:09| approved planned district, the Kroger and Fountain City, and there's some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8589)|
| 2:23:12| amendments coming and some positive things that have come from that since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8592)|
| 2:23:16| they were notified. There's a little bit of confusion that has come up from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8596)|
| 2:23:23| wording and that, Ms. Brooks, if I could ask you to clarify a little bit and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8603)|
| 2:23:30| maybe touch on some conversation that you had at the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8610)|
| 2:23:36| meeting. So one thing that's important to note is in 1.4.G, number one, as of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8616)|
| 2:23:45| effective date of this code being the code that we adopted or recode, all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8625)|
| 2:23:49| previously approved planned districts remain in effect and are subject to all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8629)|
| 2:23:54| plans, regulations, and or conditions of their approval. One of the concerns is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8634)|
| 2:24:00| the using of special use throughout this, but those plans don't, special use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8640)|
| 2:24:08| does not apply to them. It's actually the previously known use on review that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8648)|
| 2:24:14| very specific and detailed in Article 4, Section 5. So I'm concerned about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8654)|
| 2:24:22| fact that we don't declare anything about use on review or that Section 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8662)|
| 2:24:29| I mean, Article 4, Section 5. Okay, Ms. Brooks. Amy Brooks, Interim Director of Knoxville-Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8669)|
| 2:24:38| County Planning. So the new special use term, it's new, but the process that staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8678)|
| 2:24:45| uses to evaluate these type of applications is the same as what was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8685)|
| 2:24:51| previously called use on review. So it's a new code with updated and modernized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8691)|
| 2:24:57| language and that was intentional. That being said, in this particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8697)|
| 2:25:01| instance, it should not be a concern of special use or use on the review are the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8701)|
| 2:25:06| same or different. And I think Councilmember Ryder already touched on this. So the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8706)|
| 2:25:10| application process to make changes is now called a special use application, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8710)|
| 2:25:15| these previously approved planned districts are not being evaluated under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8715)|
| 2:25:18| that special use process in the new code. This is just the application type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8718)|
| 2:25:21| that they will submit to request any changes. So per Article 1.4G1 of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8721)|
| 2:25:29| new code, as of the effective date of the code, all previously approved planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8729)|
| 2:25:33| districts of, I won't read all those out, but all these formally approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8733)|
| 2:25:38| planned districts remain in effect and are subject to all plans, regulations, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8738)|
| 2:25:43| or conditions of their approval. I think it's important to highlight the word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8743)|
| 2:25:47| regulations. Regulations means all requirements and procedures which were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8747)|
| 2:25:51| formally detailed in Article 4 in the old city code, which references that use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8751)|
| 2:25:56| on review process and administrative procedures for planned districts. These| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8756)|
| 2:25:59| regulations in effect, so prior to January 1st, 2020, will be the regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8759)|
| 2:26:04| under which any formally approved planned district will be evaluated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8764)|
| 2:26:10| Is that what you're looking for, Councilmember? It does. So if someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8770)|
| 2:26:17| comes in, like the one that's coming forward in the future, and they want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8777)|
| 2:26:21| make an amendment to the previously approved plan and they fill out an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8781)|
| 2:26:27| application, which happens to have only a checkbox called special use, your staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8787)|
| 2:26:34| does what? Well, it's actually a development request and there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8794)|
| 2:26:39| the way it's worded on the application is use on review slash special use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8799)|
| 2:26:44| because we still have use on review, that terminology in the county. So if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8804)|
| 2:26:49| are requesting a deviation from that previously approved plan, we would require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8809)|
| 2:26:53| them to resubmit a site plan and identify any proposed changes that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8813)|
| 2:26:58| they are wanting to make. That would include detailing out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8818)|
| 2:27:02| any conditions of that previously approved plan that they were wanting to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8822)|
| 2:27:07| change. So all that would have to be detailed out. And then also we would go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8827)|
| 2:27:11| through the same notification process to the community to notify them of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8831)|
| 2:27:17| application. So postcards, sign on the property, notification in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8837)|
| 2:27:23| newspaper, and then it would be reviewed by the Planning Commission. Okay, so an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8843)|
| 2:27:31| amendment that I have touch base with you on in our packet, of course it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8851)|
| 2:27:41| crashes on me as I'm trying to pull it up. Hold on. All right, 12D. I just want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8861)|
| 2:27:54| make sure people know what page I'm talking about. Great, now it's crashing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8874)|
| 2:27:59| every time I open it. I feel like this happened before, two years ago. Well, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8879)|
| 2:28:04| app is crashing. Okay, so I can't tell people what page number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8884)|
| 2:28:09| Council Member, I think it's page 5. The first page is 519. Okay, so on page 519,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8889)|
| 2:28:17| which is section 14.2, which is the Knoxville-Knox County Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8897)|
| 2:28:25| powers. So one of the things that we're voting on is an amendment to say to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8905)|
| 2:28:32| final decisions on special use applications for previously approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8912)|
| 2:28:38| plan districts to modify or remove requirements or any plans, conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8918)|
| 2:28:41| placed on those properties. I would like to make a motion to amend, an amended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8921)|
| 2:28:48| motion to strike the word special use because that causes a lot of muddy water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8928)|
| 2:28:57| because they're filling out your application and they're checking the box| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8937)|
| 2:29:02| that happens to say use on review special use and this is something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8942)|
| 2:29:05| we've discussed at length and you're not comfortable with the words use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8945)|
| 2:29:09| being in there. So I'm questioning the necessity of either set of words being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8949)|
| 2:29:14| in there. Maybe we should, you said the amendment and get a second and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8954)|
| 2:29:20| discuss it? Sure. Okay, motion made to strike the word special use on page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8960)|
| 2:29:27| whatever Ms. Brooks said. 519. Made by Councilwoman Ryder, seconded by Council Member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8967)|
| 2:29:35| Roberto. Ms. Ryder, you were explaining your rationale. Yeah, so and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8975)|
| 2:29:43| have another minor amendment. I think it confuses and says even though the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8983)|
| 2:29:50| previous part in 1.4 G says the regulations that were in effect at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8990)|
| 2:29:55| time the plan was approved, which is used on review, which is very specific and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8995)|
| 2:29:59| many pages long of the requirements and what needs to be done and so it's not to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=8999)|
| 2:30:04| confuse if we just get rid of the word special use and stick with application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9004)|
| 2:30:08| and refer back to what was in use at the time, which goes back to what Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9008)|
| 2:30:13| Brooks clarified, which is the regulations on the books at the time. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9013)|
| 2:30:19| that we're not bouncing people back and forth between special use and use on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9019)|
| 2:30:23| review and causing ambiguity. Okay. Causing ambiguity, sorry. Does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9023)|
| 2:30:30| everybody understand the motion to amend? Ms. Brooks or Ms. Ryder, can you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9030)|
| 2:30:37| clarify? Okay. If you look at word special use, we can't. I heard the page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9037)|
| 2:30:48| number, but can you tell me this section with on the page number? I mean. Do you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9048)|
| 2:30:55| want me to read out the sections, Council Member Ryder? Yeah, you can. I can't get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9055)|
| 2:31:00| my app to work right now. Okay. So it's Article 16.2B2 and it's in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9060)|
| 2:31:09| first line. Council Member Ryder has struck out special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9069)|
| 2:31:15| And then there's another one as well. And I just have, and I apologize, I just have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9075)|
| 2:31:23| a screenshot, but it's Article 14.2B, wait, I'm sorry, 14.2C and it's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9083)|
| 2:31:33| same striking out special use in front of applications in the first line. And I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9093)|
| 2:31:40| apologize, I can't see that page number on that one. Amy, you said the first one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9100)|
| 2:31:46| was Article 16.2B2? 16.2B2. Thank you. So in both instances, striking out. Yeah, in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9106)|
| 2:32:03| both instances, which is 14.2C, which is on the top of page 519, and then the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9123)|
| 2:32:12| other one's towards the bottom of page 519 in the packet, and that's the 16.2B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9132)|
| 2:32:18| Since they're using the special use process rather than specify, I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9138)|
| 2:32:24| they're using the use on review, instead of specifying what the process is, just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9144)|
| 2:32:29| strike the words and refer to the application. Because 1.4B is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9149)|
| 2:32:37| redirecting them to the special use process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9157)|
| 2:32:42| Okay, any further questions or discussion on this proposed amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9162)|
| 2:32:51| Council Member McDaniel. Oh, thank you, Mayor. So I guess what I want to do is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9171)|
| 2:32:58| talk about why I see the confusion here. So the process as proposed in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9178)|
| 2:33:04| amendment in our packet is using the term special use for the previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9184)|
| 2:33:09| approved plan districts. I think this will unnecessarily add confusion to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9189)|
| 2:33:15| review process because some of the previous district provisions brought in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9195)|
| 2:33:20| under use on review, such as architectural plans, detailed landscape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9200)|
| 2:33:26| plans, an overall development plan, and a general use plan, the use map, are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9206)|
| 2:33:31| part of the special use process. So when we're talking about bringing in these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9211)|
| 2:33:38| items that had previously been approved in plan districts, in our new, in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9218)|
| 2:33:44| current zoning ordinance, we don't have plan districts. So they were created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9224)|
| 2:33:52| under the use on review process. And I think the issue is that when we start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9232)|
| 2:33:58| talking about special use, whether that means what, you know, the process that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9238)|
| 2:34:05| in, that's involved in the current zoning ordinance as special use, or it's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9245)|
| 2:34:10| box you check on a form, it's confusing. And what we're left with is that we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9250)|
| 2:34:17| got some provisions that previously approved plan districts came in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9257)|
| 2:34:22| existence through, which are no longer referenced at all in the new, in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9262)|
| 2:34:29| current zoning ordinance. So you have property owners and neighborhood groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9269)|
| 2:34:33| who had previously accepted a rezoning to plan district, and in that they got a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9273)|
| 2:34:40| review of a development plan that included those requirements we just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9280)|
| 2:34:43| talked about. Architectural plans, detailed landscape plan, and an overall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9283)|
| 2:34:48| development plan and general use map. They knew what was required and that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9288)|
| 2:34:53| path was clear on what they were going to do there. Under the current proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9293)|
| 2:34:57| to use special use, these plan district requirements are not mentioned at all. And so an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9297)|
| 2:35:02| interpretation is needed. Now I'm concerned that the lack of clarity in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9302)|
| 2:35:06| the proposed language, specifically regarding those items we just talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9306)|
| 2:35:10| about that are not mentioned, is going to require future interpretation by first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9310)|
| 2:35:14| planning commission and then council by appeal. So the end result will be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9314)|
| 2:35:20| slower process because we're going to have to debate what this, what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9320)|
| 2:35:24| intention was. What was the interpretation of this? This language is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9324)|
| 2:35:28| no longer there. So I think using the existing use on review process that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9328)|
| 2:35:35| brought these planned, these previously approved plan districts into creation is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9335)|
| 2:35:41| the better way of ensuring that all of the agreements, all of the regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9341)|
| 2:35:47| that we just talked about are looked at when you're trying to make an amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9347)|
| 2:35:52| to your development plan. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9352)|
| 2:35:56| Thank you. Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9356)|
| 2:36:00| I have some broad, a couple broader questions. This new process involves the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9360)|
| 2:36:06| same amount of public input as the former process for the former language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9366)|
| 2:36:11| correct? If the question is for Ms. Brooks. Planning. Yes, that's correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9371)|
| 2:36:18| Council Member. And is there anything about the review process by planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9378)|
| 2:36:24| staff that is different for special use as opposed to use on review? No, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9384)|
| 2:36:31| approach the reviews the same way. Okay, so I guess I have a question for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9391)|
| 2:36:38| Council Member Roberto. What, was there a specific example where there's maybe, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9398)|
| 2:36:45| it the language or the process that is, that you were highlighting? I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9405)|
| 2:36:48| make sure I understand. Right, so if you were to look at the old language in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9408)|
| 2:36:55| previous zoning ordinance, in particular, I had asked Mr. Frost earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9415)|
| 2:37:05| to review this and see if he saw the same concern with that lack of clarity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9425)|
| 2:37:10| and the potential for needing to have an interpretation. And so specifically, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9430)|
| 2:37:15| looked in the former zoning ordinance at Section 3.2, the SC1 Neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9435)|
| 2:37:22| Shopping Center District. And in that, it has those requirements that I listed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9442)|
| 2:37:28| earlier, talking about the development plan, the architectural sketches, all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9448)|
| 2:37:33| those things. When you look at the current zoning ordinance, which is, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9453)|
| 2:37:38| think, 16.2, those items aren't mentioned. And so that's the part that I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9458)|
| 2:37:46| you're going to have to resolve by using the word special use instead of use on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9466)|
| 2:37:52| review. There's an interpretation that's going to be needed because those words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9472)|
| 2:37:57| aren't there. I know that the idea is to say, well, we're incorporating all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9477)|
| 2:38:01| regulations. But I'm concerned that by not stating what they were, that you may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9481)|
| 2:38:09| inadvertently cause, you know, an issue where we're going to have to interpret| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9489)|
| 2:38:14| what we meant by not including that in there. Does that help? I understand what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9494)|
| 2:38:20| you're saying, Navia. Thank you. I have one follow-up question for Mr. Frost, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9500)|
| 2:38:27| that's okay. Sure, go ahead. Mr. Frost, are you still with us? I am. Can you clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9507)|
| 2:38:33| the word regulations as it relates to this topic? And how you interpret that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9513)|
| 2:38:41| Well, thank you, Council Member Smith. You know, well, it's not up to me to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9521)|
| 2:38:47| interpret it, because the person will come into the Planning Commission. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9527)|
| 2:38:51| the Planning Commission will look at the situation, and they will have the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9531)|
| 2:38:56| determination on what are the regulations. You know, as Mr. Roberto| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9536)|
| 2:39:05| succinctly stated, under the old zoning code from, you know, last year, specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9545)|
| 2:39:14| things are spelled out that are not in the current zoning code. I mean, I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9554)|
| 2:39:25| I see Interim Director Brooks's point and Council Member Ryder's point as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9565)|
| 2:39:31| well. I mean, it's hard for me to say, you know, really which is best. I mean, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9571)|
| 2:39:40| would think if I was a developer, I would prefer to know going in as many of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9580)|
| 2:39:48| the elements that may be expected of me when I apply to do whatever. And, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9588)|
| 2:39:56| know, so they could kind of have a mental checklist of being able to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9596)|
| 2:40:00| down. In that regard, the old zoning code is, has that type of information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9600)|
| 2:40:07| because it talks about general land use map of the surrounding neighborhood that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9607)|
| 2:40:12| shows the relationship between the proposed development, the arteries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9612)|
| 2:40:16| traffic arteries, public transportation, neighborhood land uses, you know, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9616)|
| 2:40:21| sketches showing tentative building sites, shapes and locations and general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9621)|
| 2:40:27| parking lot arrangement. So, in part of recode, as Ms. Brooks described, it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9627)|
| 2:40:35| more of a modernization and some of that language has been deleted. You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9635)|
| 2:40:42| there are pros and cons to that. It's ultimately, you know, what Council is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9642)|
| 2:40:46| going to decide what, whether or not to accept it or modify it. So, just think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9646)|
| 2:40:54| about what's changed. Think about if you like the changes and think about if this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9654)|
| 2:41:00| is something a developer and the community will be able to get along with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9660)|
| 2:41:09| Thank you. I ask one more question just to round it out. Ms. Brooks, one more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9669)|
| 2:41:18| question. Is a site plan, a site plan is very specific. Is that involved in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9678)|
| 2:41:25| special use process? Almost all of our special uses would require some form of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9685)|
| 2:41:32| site plan, yes. So, previously planned developments include a site plan and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9692)|
| 2:41:39| will continue to require a site plan? Correct. Okay. All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9699)|
| 2:41:46| Council Member Ryder. So, Ms. Brooks, to follow up on Mr. Smith's question and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9706)|
| 2:41:55| response from Mr. Frost, if I am a property owner and I acquire a property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9715)|
| 2:42:05| that's under a previously approved plan and I decide I want to modify something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9725)|
| 2:42:10| and I come into your staff and I say, hey, I want to make a change and your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9730)|
| 2:42:17| staff says, okay, well, let's look it up. Your previously approved plan district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9737)|
| 2:42:23| that triggers these, the rules and regulations at the time. How will they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9743)|
| 2:42:31| know what all they have to include and what all is included in the checklist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9751)|
| 2:42:38| that Council Member Roberto went through? Like, and I misspoke earlier. I said, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9758)|
| 2:42:44| some of it's in Article 4. I'll stop. Well, it's in Article 7, sorry, Section 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9764)|
| 2:42:50| But it talks about development plan, showing the use of the uses, dimensions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9770)|
| 2:42:55| and locations of proposed streets, parks, playgrounds, school sites. So, the laundry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9775)|
| 2:43:00| list of things that need to be provided, architectural sketches, data that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9780)|
| 2:43:05| Council Member Roberto went through, how will they know that these things are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9785)|
| 2:43:11| needed and how will future planning staff know? As with most applicants, staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9791)|
| 2:43:21| ends up walking them through the process and we do a lot of hand-holding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9801)|
| 2:43:28| in terms of, people don't typically come to us and say, we've read through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9808)|
| 2:43:33| ordinance and this is what we know that we need to submit. They usually call us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9813)|
| 2:43:36| first, we walk them through the process and tell them exactly what we need. With| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9816)|
| 2:43:40| these previously approved plan districts, they will be mapped, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9820)|
| 2:43:44| these amendments go through, with a C. So, that will notify us as staff, as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9824)|
| 2:43:50| property owners and community members, alert them that these are previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9830)|
| 2:43:54| approved plan districts. We would need to also, as part of this, pull up all those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9834)|
| 2:44:00| previously planned approvals to see what was submitted and what was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9840)|
| 2:44:04| approved. So, that would be one of the first steps. If they were going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9844)|
| 2:44:08| make any changes, they would need to resubmit, in most cases, identically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9848)|
| 2:44:13| what they submitted before, so we could compare it to what was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9853)|
| 2:44:16| previously approved. This is not uncommon in what we do on a regular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9856)|
| 2:44:22| basis. I would say we, as planning staff, administer the subdivision regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9862)|
| 2:44:27| which are updated more frequently than the zoning code, but oftentimes we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9867)|
| 2:44:32| to go back and look at those subdivision regulations at the time of approval to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9872)|
| 2:44:37| make sure that any changes that someone wants to make comply with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9877)|
| 2:44:43| previous version. So, we have access to all of that. For instance, it's all in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9883)|
| 2:44:47| muni code. I don't know if that answers your question, but...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9887)|
| 2:44:54| Thank you, Ms. Brooks. Any further questions or comments on the amendment before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9894)|
| 2:45:00| that Ms. Ryder is proposing? Councilman Roberto. Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9900)|
| 2:45:09| My question is for Ms. Brooks. So, I understand what, if I understand what you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9909)|
| 2:45:15| said in response to Councilperson Ryder, was that if somebody in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9915)|
| 2:45:21| previously approved plan district wants to make amendments to their development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9921)|
| 2:45:26| plan, that they'll have to submit to you all of the previously required documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9926)|
| 2:45:33| like the development plan, the general use map, all the other things that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9933)|
| 2:45:37| talked about through your process. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9937)|
| 2:45:43| Each application might be unique in terms of what they might be wanting to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9943)|
| 2:45:47| modify, but yes, if they submitted... It really depends on exactly what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9947)|
| 2:45:54| they're trying to change, but yes, we would have to see a site plan if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9954)|
| 2:45:57| were going to change anything about their elevations. If they wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9957)|
| 2:46:00| change their conditions, we would have to see all of that same material to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9960)|

| 2:46:08| previously approved had certain documents that went with it when it got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9968)|
| 2:46:13| approved, and you're going to need to see the exact same documents when you go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9973)|

| 2:46:21| forward. Is that right? Essentially, yes. Okay. So, my question is, you know, do we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9981)|
| 2:46:28| to have the specific language in there referring to the previous use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9988)|
| 2:46:35| to make it clear that that's the case? The issue that I see is that it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=9995)|
| 2:46:42| necessarily clear that you have to bring all that with you with what I've read in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10002)|

| 2:46:54| question. Are you asking Ms. Brooks? Yeah, I am. Ms. Brooks? My opinion is no. I feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10014)|
| 2:47:06| like the amendments that are before you make it clear to our current staff as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10026)|

| 2:50:15| Ms. Parker, I believe it's just so people can use our parks, you know, as an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10215)|

| 2:50:27| have some more details to add to that? I can speak to this, Mayor. Oh, okay. Sorry, this is not a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10227)|

| 2:50:45| apologize, Councilmember Parker, I had a hard time hearing, but I think that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10245)|
| 2:50:50| were asking if this was for a specific school? Yeah. Okay. You know, this did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10250)|
| 2:50:57| originate with a request from IM's Nature Center. They have an interest in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10257)|
| 2:51:04| allowing a preschool kindergarten at their facility. So, that was the, how this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10264)|
| 2:51:10| originally came up and the administration asked us to evaluate the potential for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10270)|
| 2:51:17| allowing these as a special use in the Open Space District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10277)|
| 2:51:26| Can you help me understand what it is about their current zoning that wouldn't allow that at their current property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10286)|
| 2:51:34| Ms. Brooks, could you hear that? We're having a little trouble hearing you, Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10294)|
| 2:51:40| Did you hear the question, Ms. Brooks? I think I did, and correct me if I didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10300)|
| 2:51:45| get it right. I think you were asking why they are requesting this, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10305)|
| 2:51:50| they have a current, they already have a current. Yeah, why their current facility and zoning wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10310)|
| 2:51:58| allow them to do that? Well, it's not currently allowed to have a preschool or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10318)|
| 2:52:04| kindergarten in the Open Space District, and they have specific licensing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10324)|
| 2:52:10| requirements to operate a full-time preschool or kindergarten, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10330)|
| 2:52:17| requires that they're in the appropriate zone. That's as much as I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10337)|
| 2:52:22| about it at this point. Mr. Brayes, could you add a little bit more context to this, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10342)|
| 2:52:27| Yeah, this is an issue that was raised by IM's. IM's Nature Center is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10347)|
| 2:52:35| combination of city-owned facilities and city property and also property owned by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10355)|
| 2:52:39| the Nature Center itself, and they have had an outdoor nature preschool for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10359)|
| 2:52:47| some time, but there was a threshold. That preschool was like a few hours, and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10367)|
| 2:52:52| wanted to expand it, and because of that expansion in time, it kicked them into a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10372)|
| 2:52:57| state requirement that required a zoning review, and our open space zoning, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10377)|
| 2:53:04| includes all of their property, does not allow this use, and so the solution posed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10384)|
| 2:53:09| by Ms. Brooks, the administration and planning both think it's appropriate, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10389)|
| 2:53:14| it is specific to what the good folks at IM's are doing right now, but it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10394)|
| 2:53:19| really because of the length of time that these children were staying on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10399)|
| 2:53:24| property that kicked them into the zoning requirement locally, and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10404)|
| 2:53:29| this is a solution that we think is good to meet their needs, but also should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10409)|
| 2:53:33| someone have a desire to use some of our property for a similar use in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10413)|
| 2:53:38| the future, it would be reviewed by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10418)|
| 2:53:46| That does speak to some of my concerns. I do think that our parks and open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10426)|
| 2:53:53| spaces need to be preserved, and my concern is if we open this door, saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10433)|
| 2:54:02| no to preschools is hard to do, so I wouldn't be able to support this. My| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10442)|
| 2:54:11| preference would be for IM's to rezone or apply for a rezoning of their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10451)|
| 2:54:19| property, rather than maintain that zoning and seek a special use. It may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10459)|
| 2:54:28| good for Ms. Brooks to talk about the process for that. I think IM's, the open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10468)|
| 2:54:35| space is applicable for almost everything they do, and they do a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10475)|
| 2:54:38| education, right, if you think of the Nature Center, so Ms. Brooks, if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10478)|
| 2:54:43| could talk and perhaps explain the process for reviewing that, it may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10483)|
| 2:54:49| helpful to understand why this seems appropriate for this situation at IM's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10489)|
| 2:54:55| Ms. Brooks? Sure, so if I understand the question correctly, it's the process for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10495)|
| 2:55:04| reviewing the special use? Is that correct for IM's, if this was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10504)|
| 2:55:11| approved? I think the question was, what is the process if someone else wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10511)|
| 2:55:17| do this, where it may not be appropriate? Okay, yes, so the process is, if someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10517)|
| 2:55:24| would submit an application and say they are in an open space zone, which my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10524)|
| 2:55:30| understanding, I don't have a map in front of me, but most of these are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10530)|
| 2:55:34| operated by the city, so there would have to be some type of, they would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10534)|
| 2:55:40| have to approach the city to propose this particular use, and if they wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10540)|
| 2:55:47| to move forward with that request, they'd have to submit the special use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10547)|
| 2:55:51| application, which we were just discussing a few minutes ago, for review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10551)|
| 2:55:56| by planning staff and the Planning Commission, and so we would look at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10556)|
| 2:56:00| surrounding context, there would be notification to the adjacent property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10560)|
| 2:56:06| owners, so that would generally be the process for someone to apply for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10566)|
| 2:56:10| It's a public process. I think, Ms. Brooks, the most important point of that is, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10570)|
| 2:56:15| think the only situation in the city where it would be applicable would be IM's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10575)|
| 2:56:19| because we have this Nature Center manager of property that has a joint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10579)|
| 2:56:25| IM's property and city property, so there's really not another situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10585)|
| 2:56:31| where we even be appropriate at this time, because IM's is the only entity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10591)|
| 2:56:34| that has that type of relationship now with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10594)|

| 2:59:09| go on to discuss the email that's in the Council's packet on this? Yeah, I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10749)|
| 2:59:15| I'll follow up with that. It's my understanding that you reviewed the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10755)|
| 2:59:19| application with the Law Department. Can you tell us what determination you came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10759)|
| 2:59:23| up with? Hang on, I've got stuff splayed out all over the place. But, well, I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10763)|
| 2:59:34| recall that I talked with Mr. Jim Johnson. Mr. Johnson is the Law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10774)|
| 2:59:40| Department liaison to the Public Property Naming Committee. We reviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10780)|
| 2:59:44| the ordinance that was in place at time of the application, and we likewise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10784)|
| 2:59:50| reviewed the revised ordinance. And based on that, we did not think respectfully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10790)|
| 2:59:57| that the application really met the criteria for renaming, Council Member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10797)|
| 3:00:05| Okay. Well, based on that, I can't support this item at this time because the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10805)|
| 3:00:13| application doesn't meet the criteria of the ordinance. Therefore, I'm going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10813)|
| 3:00:18| make a motion to deny. Is there a second to the motion to deny by Mr. Roberto?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10818)|
| 3:00:25| Second. Okay. I guess this is a substitute motion. Okay, so a substitute motion has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10825)|
| 3:00:33| made to deny the change of the street name, and there's been a second by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10833)|
| 3:00:40| Council Member Singh. Council Member Testerman, you have a question or comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10840)|
| 3:00:45| I'd like to hear from Councilwoman Ryder, given that I think you're a part of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10845)|
| 3:00:50| process that I read. Can you shed some light? Well, actually, so I was going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10850)|
| 3:00:56| ask Mr. Johnson if the applicant was on the call. He is. Okay, I'll just clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10856)|
| 3:01:06| that this application, because it's a renaming, it's not an honorary naming, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10866)|
| 3:01:13| originated with the Planning Commission. The ordinance that we revised in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10873)|
| 3:01:19| June is about honorary namings, and that's one of the things that we did was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10879)|
| 3:01:24| that street renamings, for many reasons, do not come to the Public Property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10884)|
| 3:01:29| Naming Commission any longer. The Planning Commission, I believe what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10889)|
| 3:01:36| Mr. Frost is the guidelines they have for a street renaming, so the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10896)|
| 3:01:44| filled out the application and paid the fee, and it was heard on consent and was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10904)|
| 3:01:50| approved unanimously at the Planning Commission. It came about in the time, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10910)|
| 3:01:56| was actually on a Planning Commission, a PPNC agenda, but it was postponed because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10916)|
| 3:02:02| the applicant wasn't present. So I didn't think it was fair to hear it without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10922)|
| 3:02:07| them there. In the time frame, multiple things happened, including COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10927)|
| 3:02:13| happened, and the ordinance changed. So this is something that originated with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10933)|
| 3:02:17| the Planning Commission, not with the Public Property Naming Committee. We were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10937)|
| 3:02:21| just kind of a middle stop until the ordinance got changed, and it was never| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10941)|
| 3:02:25| heard there. So, Mr. Johnson? I'm enabling Ms. Clabo to speak. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10945)|
| 3:02:39| Ms. Clabo, you need to unmute yourself. Okay, am I there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10959)|
| 3:02:43| Yes, ma'am. Can you just state your name and address for the record, please? My name is Cindy Clabo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10963)|

| 3:02:56| There's a threefold reason for me doing this, if I could explain. I don't want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10976)|
| 3:03:01| take up any of your time. I know you all look tired. I am too. I want to, my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=10981)|

| 3:03:20| grandmother, Bessie Layla Belcher, who was the founding resident. There's only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11000)|

| 3:03:33| at one time. Bessie Belcher, she didn't have any big notoriety, but she was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11013)|
| 3:03:40| remarkable figure. She taught Bible lessons and piano lessons to area women| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11020)|
| 3:03:47| and counseled them on domestic abuse, and she was well known throughout the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11027)|
| 3:03:52| neighborhood for doing that. And I've told my grandchildren these stories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11032)|
| 3:03:57| about what she did. She volunteered for the American Red Cross, she worked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11037)|
| 3:04:00| Standard Knitting Mills, which is one of the founding industries of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11040)|
| 3:04:04| She sewed the uniforms for Knoxville Iron Company, which is another founding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11044)|
| 3:04:10| industry, and I think she's a remarkable woman. And even, she had a write-up on the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11050)|
| 3:04:15| in one of the old newspapers, the Knoxville Free Press, at one time. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11055)|
| 3:04:21| other than that, she doesn't have any public or any, you know, anything noted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11061)|
| 3:04:27| that I can say that, that she would be, you know, honored by. But I do know the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11067)|
| 3:04:33| history, and the neighbors in this area do know the history, and I think that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11073)|
| 3:04:37| should be granted this in order to honor her. And my third reason is, I'm tired of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11077)|
| 3:04:44| people coming to my house and thinking I'm a divorce attorney on Henley Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11084)|

| 3:04:58| Thank you, Ms. Clabo. Thank you. Okay, council members, the motion before you is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11098)|
| 3:05:07| to deny this request to change the street name. Is there any further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11107)|
| 3:05:15| questions or discussion? So, a yes vote would be denying, in the way the motion is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11115)|
| 3:05:21| before you. Mr. Smith. I have a question. Procedurally, what, I guess this is for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11121)|
| 3:05:27| Ms. Brooks or Mr. Frost, what procedurally, what would happen if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11127)|
| 3:05:31| deny this? Is there another option to apply for this? Council Member Smith, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11131)|
| 3:05:37| believe her recourse would be to Knox County Chancery Court, I believe. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11137)|
| 3:05:45| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11145)|
| 3:05:48| Ms. Fugate. Thank you. I'm just trying to be sure I understand this. So, it sounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11148)|
| 3:05:59| like that, if I'm hearing what Councilwoman Ryder said, this is not a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11159)|
| 3:06:05| new street. This is a request to rename an existing street, which often just goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11165)|
| 3:06:12| to Planning Commission, and the Public Property Naming Commission doesn't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11172)|
| 3:06:17| to be involved? No. So, originally, Ms. Brooks might want to chime in, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11177)|
| 3:06:26| don't know. So, the Public Property Naming Committee was originally, my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11186)|
| 3:06:33| understanding, because I was not around when it came about, came about to review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11193)|
| 3:06:39| honorary street namings and honorary names placed on, you know, public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11199)|
| 3:06:46| property. But it was written, when it was adopted as an ordinance, it included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11206)|
| 3:06:52| street renamings. Street names, honorary names, don't go to the Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11212)|
| 3:06:59| Commission. The Planning Commission oversees addressing. So, all renamings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11219)|
| 3:07:04| have to go with them. So, some examples of past renamings that we've done that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11224)|
| 3:07:09| were waylaid because they went to the Public Property Naming Committee, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11229)|
| 3:07:13| don't think it was the intent or need for them to go there, which is why that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11233)|
| 3:07:16| ordinance was changed last June. There was a street that ended up getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11236)|
| 3:07:23| bisected by some of the Alcoa construction, and for emergency vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11243)|
| 3:07:28| purposes, the street had to be renamed. The folks that lived on that street were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11248)|
| 3:07:32| not happy that their street name was changed, but it had to be to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11252)|
| 3:07:37| sure emergency vehicles knew where to go. And so, because the way the ordinance was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11257)|
| 3:07:42| written, it lagged things in terms of getting it straightened out for emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11262)|
| 3:07:46| vehicles by going to the Public Property Naming Committee. There was no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11266)|
| 3:07:51| honorary aspect to it. It just was a street renaming. So, the way the Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11271)|
| 3:07:57| Commission has their street renamings, it impacts addresses. And right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11277)|
| 3:08:06| Ms. Clabo and her family, they own four of five properties on this dead-end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11286)|

| 3:08:21| allowed, she wants to have this renamed, the street that she owns the majority of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11301)|
| 3:08:27| the properties on. So, she went ahead, filled out the application, paid the fee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11307)|
| 3:08:31| and it was heard at the Planning Commission, and at that time, was sent to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11311)|
| 3:08:35| the Public Property Naming Committee. It's just we never heard it there because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11315)|
| 3:08:39| there was no one there to speak to the application. So, we voted to postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11319)|
| 3:08:42| And in the interim, street renamings were decreed no longer to go to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11322)|
| 3:08:51| PP&C. Does that help you? Yes. So, but here's my follow-up question, sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11331)|
| 3:08:58| what Councilman Smith was asking. So, if she were to apply today, forget us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11338)|
| 3:09:07| having been involved, if she were to apply today, would it just go to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11347)|
| 3:09:12| Planning Commission, they would decide, and we would have nothing to do with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11352)|
| 3:09:15| No, it would come to Council. The only step that got removed is PP&C. All| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11355)|
| 3:09:22| street renamings come to the, come to Council. So, we did vote on the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11362)|
| 3:09:29| renaming. Yeah, I remember voting on those on Fox. Okay. So, the question is, should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11369)|
| 3:09:37| someone be allowed to pay a fee and rename a street if everyone who has an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11377)|
| 3:09:42| address there signs petition to do so? Okay. Thank you. And now, the whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11382)|
| 3:09:50| community knows how we name streets, which is well. Thank you, Councilmember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11390)|
| 3:09:55| Ryder. Thank you, Councilmember Fugate. Mr. Roberto. Thank you, Mayor. Ms. Clabo, are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11395)|
| 3:10:01| you still on the line with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11401)|
| 3:10:05| Yes, I'm here. Oh, there you are. Okay. I want to thank you for sharing the family history that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11405)|
| 3:10:12| you did. I think that's really important, and I really do appreciate you sharing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11412)|
| 3:10:18| that with us. How old is Layla? Layla's four. She's four. Okay. So, I'm very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11418)|
| 3:10:27| confident that Layla will do great things and will eventually contribute to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11427)|
| 3:10:33| the community's history and success in a significant way, and that's what is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11433)|
| 3:10:38| actually in the ordinance for doing the renaming. So, I hope you will tell her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11438)|
| 3:10:43| that, okay? Yeah. And so, don't let her think that we don't think that, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11443)|
| 3:10:51| we do. But the issue is that we have an ordinance that tells us how to proceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11451)|
| 3:10:57| with renamings, and so that's why I made the motion to deny. Okay. Well, Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11457)|

| 3:18:02| for a more detailed discussion in two weeks. So the newly created institutional district is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11882)|
| 3:18:09| only district in our zoning code that does not have its own sign standards. We believe this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11889)|
| 3:18:16| a mistake because this will lead to inappropriate signs in future institutional district designations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11896)|
| 3:18:23| And these inappropriate signs will remain for years, even if council recognizes the era| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11903)|
| 3:18:31| and enacts more reasonable standards at a later time. So the right time to address this problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11911)|
| 3:18:38| is now. A little history, 20 years ago, the nine counties one vision initiative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11918)|

| 3:19:20| a half years of intense study and deliberation. I was a member of the city council sign task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11960)|
| 3:19:26| and was actively involved in the process. During this process, it became very clear how much the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11966)|
| 3:19:32| community cares about signs. And I think you got a little bit of that tonight when discussing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11972)|

| 3:19:46| the ugly sign clutter that marred the city's landscape. They made their feelings known by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11986)|

| 3:19:57| public forums held by city council. Council members received hundreds of emails, phone calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=11997)|
| 3:20:03| and contacts from the community, communicating their wishes for stricter sign control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=12003)|
| 3:20:09| Council wisely heeded the public's wishes and put in place a sign ordinance that would address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=12009)|
| 3:20:14| these concerns. Because existing signs were grandfathered, change comes slowly. But after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=12014)|
| 3:20:21| five years, change is apparent and the city's landscape is already noticeably improving. And I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=12021)|
| 3:20:28| watch for all that all the time. It would be a mistake to go backward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=12028)|

| 3:20:38| but this doesn't mean they no longer care about sign clutter. People want to live, work, visit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-201006?start=12038)|
