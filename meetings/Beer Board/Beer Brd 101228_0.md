| 0:00:30| The items that were distributed prior to this meeting, and I will take a motion from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=30)|
| 0:00:33| floor to approve them or a discussion on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=33)|
| 0:00:36| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=36)|
| 0:00:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=37)|
| 0:00:38| Discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=38)|
| 0:00:39| If not, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=39)|
| 0:00:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=41)|
| 0:00:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=42)|
| 0:00:43| The chair will recognize Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=43)|
| 0:00:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=47)|
| 0:00:48| Karen Pershing is here, Executive Director of the Metropolitan Drug Commission, and if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=48)|
| 0:00:51| she could come up for just a moment and explain about the packets that we usually bring and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=51)|
| 0:00:55| offer to our retailers who are asking to receive new permits tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=55)|
| 0:01:01| We wanted you all to know that she's here and available, and she just has a few things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=61)|
| 0:01:04| to cover very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=64)|
| 0:01:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=65)|
| 0:01:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=66)|
| 0:01:07| Karen Pershing, Executive Director of the Metropolitan Drug Commission, 4930 Lyons View| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=67)|
| 0:01:13| Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=73)|
| 0:01:15| We have been giving out DVD toolkits, which we do not have with us tonight, and the reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=75)|
| 0:01:20| we don't is there are two pieces of information contained in the toolkits that are date sensitive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=80)|
| 0:01:28| meaning that they will expire in three days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=88)|
| 0:01:30| So we are in the process of updating those toolkits, and as soon as the new ones are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=90)|
| 0:01:35| available, we will be happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=95)|
| 0:01:37| Any of the permit holders would like to have those, we will be happy to distribute those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=97)|
| 0:01:43| If I can get their name and address here tonight, I will be happy to send those out as soon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=103)|
| 0:01:48| as they're available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=108)|
| 0:01:50| We do have our regular packets that Wanda Day has that she will be giving out, and in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=110)|
| 0:01:56| those packets are the tips for reducing liability that's really important for businesses to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=116)|
| 0:02:03| have, and some ID checkers as well in there, and several other posters and buttons and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=123)|
| 0:02:09| information to try to curtail the sale of alcoholic beverages to underage consumers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=129)|
| 0:02:17| And another thing I just wanted to mention quickly was 4 Loco and Juice, which are two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=137)|
| 0:02:23| caffeinated alcoholic energy drinks, have been removed from the shelves nationwide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=143)|
| 0:02:31| These products are in the process of being reformulated and basically the caffeine being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=151)|
| 0:02:36| taken out of the products, but these products will be back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=156)|
| 0:02:41| If you look at the packaging and marketing of the products, it would be very hard to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=161)|
| 0:02:46| make a case for the fact that they're not trying to target underage drinkers, so I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=166)|
| 0:02:52| we just need to be aware that those products will be coming back onto the shelves, reformulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=172)|
| 0:02:59| For each can that's sold in convenience stores, one can is the equivalent of three beers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=179)|
| 0:03:07| so the chances of binge drinking go up quite significantly with these, plus it's easy to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=187)|
| 0:03:14| mistake them for regular energy drinks the way they're packaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=194)|
| 0:03:18| So we would just appreciate your support of both the city and the county beer boards to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=198)|
| 0:03:26| really take a look at these products when they do come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=206)|
| 0:03:30| Thank you, Ms. Pershing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=210)|
| 0:03:31| I'm proud that the Metropolitan Drug Commission has really been ahead of the curve on monitoring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=211)|
| 0:03:35| these caffeinated energy drinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=215)|
| 0:03:37| It's kind of like a Red Bull with a huge hit of alcohol, and we've been ahead of the curve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=217)|
| 0:03:41| monitoring in our area and are very pleased that the manufacturer has chosen to withdraw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=221)|
| 0:03:45| these because they've proven to be very dangerous and deadly in some areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=225)|
| 0:03:50| Councilman DelVolpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=230)|
| 0:03:51| Yeah, I just wonder if she wouldn't mind repeating the name of those two that are being withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=231)|
| 0:03:56| Four Loco in Juice, which juice is spelled J-O-O-S-E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=236)|
| 0:03:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=239)|
| 0:04:00| Four Loco, as in going crazy, I mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=240)|
| 0:04:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=246)|
| 0:04:07| They were referred to as blackout in a can, if that tells you anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=247)|
| 0:04:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=253)|
| 0:04:14| Thank you for being here this evening and looking forward to having more information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=254)|
| 0:04:19| as it becomes available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=259)|
| 0:04:20| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=260)|
| 0:04:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=261)|
| 0:04:22| When I call your name, if you'll come up to the podium, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=262)|
| 0:04:27| First up is Bambi's, and I don't think they're going to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=267)|
| 0:04:32| I'm going to ask to postpone that until the January 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=272)|
| 0:04:37| Mr. Chairman, does our record check say that they've withdrawn, or am I mistaken?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=277)|
| 0:04:40| They have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=280)|
| 0:04:41| They contacted WANDA today and asked perhaps for a postponement, so I'm going to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=281)|
| 0:04:51| and make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=291)|
| 0:04:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=292)|
| 0:04:53| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=293)|
| 0:04:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=296)|
| 0:04:57| January 25th, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=297)|
| 0:05:02| Next up is Bliss Entertainment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=302)|
| 0:05:12| Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=312)|
| 0:05:14| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=314)|
| 0:05:15| Bliss Entertainment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=315)|
| 0:05:16| I'm Ray Adelman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=316)|
| 0:05:17| And I'm Jason Lovely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=317)|
| 0:05:18| 118 South Central Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=318)|
| 0:05:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=320)|
| 0:05:21| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=321)|
| 0:05:22| And we need a copy of the sales tax registration, building inspection approval, fire prevention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=322)|
| 0:05:28| approval, and health department approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=328)|
| 0:05:31| Sixth District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=331)|
| 0:05:32| I did a tour down there, and I think it's going to be a very fine place, and I'm going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=332)|
| 0:05:38| to move to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=338)|
| 0:05:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=341)|
| 0:05:42| Discussion on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=342)|
| 0:05:43| Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=343)|
| 0:05:44| Yeah, I wanted to just quickly compliment Mr. Lovely and Mr. Adelman for actually filling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=344)|
| 0:05:50| out the question about any convictions or misdemeanors in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=350)|
| 0:05:55| It's an interesting one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=355)|
| 0:05:56| Truth is, if you've got any misdemeanors and you put them down, you're clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=356)|
| 0:06:02| If you answer no and we find misdemeanors, it actually gives us a right to deny your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=362)|
| 0:06:07| application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=367)|
| 0:06:08| So I want to compliment you all for doing that correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=368)|
| 0:06:11| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=371)|
| 0:06:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=374)|
| 0:06:15| You'll see Ms. Day, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=375)|
| 0:06:18| First Casual Cafe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=378)|
| 0:06:32| I'm Anthony Rushing, and we're at 5615 Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=392)|
| 0:06:36| I'm Jerry Stewart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=396)|
| 0:06:38| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=398)|
| 0:06:40| Ms. Byron.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=400)|
| 0:06:41| Building inspection approval, fire prevention approval, and health department approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=401)|
| 0:06:45| Third District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=405)|
| 0:06:47| Building inspection approval pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=407)|
| 0:06:50| Final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=410)|
| 0:06:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=411)|
| 0:06:52| Second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=412)|
| 0:06:53| Discussion by Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=413)|
| 0:06:54| Yeah, I'm just going to, the Greers, Philip L. and Philip Gere, didn't actually answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=414)|
| 0:06:59| the question that the last applicants did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=419)|
| 0:07:01| And I doubt we're going to do anything, but if they were concerned about this, that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=421)|
| 0:07:04| give us a reason to deny the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=424)|
| 0:07:08| And just in general, filling out a form correctly is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=428)|
| 0:07:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=432)|

| 0:07:14| I have a couple of questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=434)|
| 0:07:16| Welcome to the Third District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=436)|

| 0:08:14| I'm going to move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=494)|
| 0:08:16| But I wanted to point out on here, it has, for the school zone, Sequoia Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=496)|
| 0:08:23| But this is really closer to Green School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=503)|
| 0:08:30| And that's, I've noticed that's on quite a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=510)|
| 0:08:32| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=512)|
| 0:08:33| I don't know why, but oft times Green School is not listed as the closest school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=513)|
| 0:08:39| It's not listed here as the closest school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=519)|
| 0:08:42| It is the closest elementary school to this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=522)|
| 0:08:46| Move to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=526)|

| 0:08:53| If not, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=533)|

| 0:08:56| You'll see Ms. Day, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=536)|
| 0:08:59| Gaddy's Pizza, as you see in your packet, has asked for a postponement until January the 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=539)|
| 0:09:06| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=546)|
| 0:09:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=547)|

| 0:09:09| If not, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=549)|
| 0:09:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=551)|
| 0:09:19| Next up is Haru, Hibachi, and Sushi, which we're all very familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=559)|
| 0:09:25| Ms. Dyer, do you have any information to share on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=565)|
| 0:09:29| Well, we sent a registered letter and it came back unclaimed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=569)|
| 0:09:34| Ms. Day has tried notifying them at all the numbers listed on the application and they're disconnected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=574)|
| 0:09:39| So we have been unable to contact this applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=579)|
| 0:09:43| And this began when, Ms. Day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=583)|
| 0:09:47| In August for the September meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=587)|
| 0:09:50| Is this the second district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=590)|
| 0:09:53| I've been by there a couple of times and there's signs in the window, but I haven't heard anything either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=593)|
| 0:10:01| you know, in terms of any kind of where they're moving ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=601)|
| 0:10:06| Okay, so we would, the chair will entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=606)|
| 0:10:10| To?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=610)|
| 0:10:12| I mean, this has been, this has been before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=612)|
| 0:10:15| Or no motion. If there's no motion, then it just dies and it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=615)|
| 0:10:19| They start over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=619)|
| 0:10:20| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=620)|
| 0:10:23| Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=623)|
| 0:10:24| What do we think's going on over there? Are they just, are they working on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=624)|
| 0:10:28| Does it look like they're going to try to open it or do anything with it? It's just vacant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=628)|
| 0:10:33| It's just, I don't, there just seems to be no activity, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=633)|
| 0:10:37| I haven't been able to see anybody there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=637)|
| 0:10:39| So, this has been before us how many times?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=639)|
| 0:10:43| Less than September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=643)|
| 0:10:46| I'd be willing to postpone it one more beer board meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=646)|
| 0:10:50| and, you know, maybe some of us could investigate a little ourselves and see what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=650)|
| 0:10:55| Give them the benefit of the doubt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=655)|
| 0:10:59| If that was a motion, I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=659)|
| 0:11:02| I'll make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=662)|
| 0:11:03| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=663)|
| 0:11:06| Further discussion on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=666)|
| 0:11:10| If not...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=670)|
| 0:11:11| We're postponing, is that the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=671)|
| 0:11:13| Well, to postpone it until January 25th meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=673)|
| 0:11:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=676)|
| 0:11:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=677)|
| 0:11:18| That's a proper motion, seeing no other likes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=678)|
| 0:11:20| All those in favor of the postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=680)|
| 0:11:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=683)|
| 0:11:24| Opposed, like sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=684)|
| 0:11:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=687)|
| 0:11:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=688)|
| 0:11:30| Could you clarify, Mr. Chairman, what's going to happen in the interim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=690)|
| 0:11:33| Anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=693)|
| 0:11:34| Well, I think somebody's going to perhaps do some investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=694)|
| 0:11:37| I don't know what, you know, we looked at the one in your district and you were successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=697)|
| 0:11:42| Of course, we're going to deal with them again at the end of this agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=702)|
| 0:11:45| But, Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=705)|
| 0:11:48| Yes, Mr. Chairman, I'll go by there and see what I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=708)|
| 0:11:51| I've not gone by to look at it to see what they're doing or not doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=711)|
| 0:11:55| but I just always like to give them the benefit of the doubt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=715)|
| 0:11:57| It doesn't do us any harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=717)|
| 0:11:59| We just have to hear it again, and so I'm going to try to see what I can find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=719)|
| 0:12:04| It seems like in this economy some people give up, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=724)|
| 0:12:07| I don't know, but it could very well be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=727)|
| 0:12:10| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=730)|
| 0:12:11| I've been by several times to check on it because I was hoping that we could move this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=731)|
| 0:12:15| It looks like they have items inside getting ready to set up to open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=735)|
| 0:12:20| and there's an occasional sign that changes on the window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=740)|
| 0:12:24| But I've never been by there at a time when there were customers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=744)|
| 0:12:28| or it looked like there was anyone working inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=748)|
| 0:12:32| Yes, and it doesn't really tax this board, but it does tax the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=752)|
| 0:12:37| And I thought, you know, obviously I voted against it and that's fine that it's moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=757)|
| 0:12:42| but I think there comes a time when, you know, we've got to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=762)|
| 0:12:46| So we'll move on with another issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=766)|
| 0:12:49| So we voted on that round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=769)|

| 0:13:50| and surrender of the former owner's beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=830)|

| 0:15:38| According to the records check from the police department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=938)|
| 0:15:42| one of the applicants has not been in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=942)|
| 0:15:44| I guess it actually says missing prints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=944)|
| 0:15:47| so it has not been completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=947)|
| 0:15:49| So we would probably not deal with it tonight anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=949)|

| 0:16:08| It's nice to see the task class right there on that same sheet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=968)|
| 0:16:10| of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=970)|
| 0:16:11| That's very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=971)|
| 0:16:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=972)|
| 0:16:13| It is a proper motion to postpone until January 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=973)|
| 0:16:16| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=976)|
| 0:16:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=977)|

| 0:16:36| Paul Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=996)|
| 0:16:37| It is 4429 Kingston Pike, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=997)|
| 0:16:41| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1001)|
| 0:16:43| Building inspection approval, fire prevention approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1003)|
| 0:16:46| and the surrender of the former owner's beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1006)|
| 0:16:50| Move to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1010)|
| 0:16:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1013)|
| 0:16:54| Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1014)|
| 0:16:55| Yes, I just wanted to ask the owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1015)|
| 0:16:57| I thought this was just recently made into one tree grill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1017)|
| 0:17:01| We're just changing ownership and starting up again, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1021)|
| 0:17:04| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1024)|
| 0:17:05| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1025)|
| 0:17:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1026)|
| 0:17:09| Any further discussion on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1029)|
| 0:17:10| If not, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1030)|
| 0:17:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1032)|
| 0:17:14| Ms. Day, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1034)|
| 0:17:19| Let's see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1039)|
| 0:17:20| Smokies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1040)|
| 0:17:23| Apparently their lease has not worked out for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1043)|
| 0:17:28| and they wish to withdraw, but will still need to take an action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1048)|
| 0:17:33| Move to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1053)|
| 0:17:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1054)|
| 0:17:36| As I read this, have they said someplace they want withdrawal or a postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1056)|
| 0:17:44| I think it's a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1064)|
| 0:17:46| Well, I asked that question to Ms. Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1066)|
| 0:17:49| She had conversation with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1069)|
| 0:17:53| Okay, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1073)|
| 0:17:54| She's given up on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1074)|
| 0:17:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1075)|
| 0:17:56| Because that was obvious to me as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1076)|
| 0:17:58| Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1078)|
| 0:17:59| Yes, if it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1079)|
| 0:18:03| I think we might want to postpone this just for one meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1083)|
| 0:18:07| I was contacted by someone out there right before Christmas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1087)|
| 0:18:11| and there was some concern about the requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1091)|
| 0:18:15| since the floor above and below it were both concrete poured floors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1095)|
| 0:18:19| whether this full system was required for the whole building or just for the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1099)|
| 0:18:24| But it made a difference in terms of the cost of renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1104)|
| 0:18:28| If I'm permitted, I would go back and investigate that further and report back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1108)|
| 0:18:33| I withdraw my motion to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1113)|
| 0:18:36| I withdraw, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1116)|
| 0:18:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1117)|
| 0:18:38| Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1118)|
| 0:18:39| We need a motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1119)|
| 0:18:40| Was that a motion to postpone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1120)|
| 0:18:41| Yeah, so that leads up to a motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1121)|
| 0:18:43| I'll second that, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1123)|
| 0:18:44| To the January 25th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1124)|
| 0:18:47| That's a proper motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1127)|
| 0:18:48| No further discussion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1128)|
| 0:18:49| All those in favor of postponement, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1129)|
| 0:18:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1132)|
| 0:18:58| Southside Sports Bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1138)|
| 0:19:01| Ryan Greenberg, 125A East Moody Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1141)|
| 0:19:05| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1145)|
| 0:19:07| Building inspection approval, health department approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1147)|
| 0:19:10| and surrender of the former owner's beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1150)|
| 0:19:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1153)|
| 0:19:14| I'll make a motion to approve, subject to the final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1154)|
| 0:19:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1157)|
| 0:19:18| Discussion on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1158)|
| 0:19:20| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1160)|
| 0:19:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1161)|
| 0:19:22| Ms. Day, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1162)|
| 0:19:25| Ms. Day, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1165)|
| 0:19:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1186)|
| 0:19:48| Tobacco Express.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1188)|
| 0:19:51| Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1191)|
| 0:19:55| They have not been in for processing, have not done task class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1195)|
| 0:19:58| so I'm going to move to postpone to the next beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1198)|
| 0:20:01| Which would be January the 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1201)|
| 0:20:03| It's a proper motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1203)|
| 0:20:05| All those in favor of the motion, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1205)|
| 0:20:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1207)|
| 0:20:25| Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1225)|
| 0:20:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1226)|
| 0:20:27| I might suggest that when we pass a lot of these proposals or requests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1227)|
| 0:20:35| for the next meeting, maybe we could hold on to these packet information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1235)|
| 0:20:39| and give it back to Ms. Day and stop xeroxing and re-xeroxing the same information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1239)|
| 0:20:44| a hundred times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1244)|
| 0:20:45| It wastes money, it wastes trees, and it isn't very hard to sort the packet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1245)|
| 0:20:48| as you're going, so just a thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1248)|
| 0:20:51| I think it's an excellent suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1251)|
| 0:20:54| We might still be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1254)|
| 0:20:57| I guess the only thought I have on that is like they hadn't been in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1257)|
| 0:21:03| and done the task that it would still show up as such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1263)|
| 0:21:08| I assume they could reshuffle or throw them away, but we'd give them the option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1268)|
| 0:21:12| of not wasting ten copies of something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1272)|
| 0:21:15| I mean, does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1275)|
| 0:21:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1277)|
| 0:21:18| It's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1278)|
| 0:21:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1281)|
| 0:21:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1284)|
| 0:21:26| We've got some more business before us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1286)|
| 0:21:29| We've got some businesses here that have been dragging the feet a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1289)|
| 0:21:35| First is Eastside Market on 2705 Martin Luther King Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1295)|
| 0:21:40| and they were approved at the September 21st meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1300)|
| 0:21:44| And it looks like that we sent them registered mail on the 6th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1304)|
| 0:21:50| and they signed it and returned it, but they haven't been in to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1310)|
| 0:21:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1315)|
| 0:21:58| So what's the Board's pleasure here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1318)|
| 0:22:03| Sixth District?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1323)|
| 0:22:06| They have not responded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1326)|
| 0:22:09| They responded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1329)|
| 0:22:12| They signed for the registered letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| Well, I'm going to make a motion that we postpone it to the next beer board meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1335)|
| 0:22:21| and give them an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1341)|
| 0:22:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| Well, we can extend it rather than postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1347)|
| 0:22:32| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1352)|
| 0:22:33| For 30 days or to the next 25th, January 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1353)|
| 0:22:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1357)|
| 0:22:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1358)|
| 0:22:39| So that is a proper motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1359)|
| 0:22:41| Is there any further discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| If not, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1363)|
| 0:22:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1365)|
| 0:22:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1366)|
| 0:22:47| Next up is Mandarin Palace, 3001 Knoxville Center Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1367)|
| 0:22:51| I do believe that would be the Second District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| I'm assuming that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1374)|
| 0:22:57| Same scenario other than they have not, we have not received back the registered mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1377)|
| 0:23:05| We did attempt making phone calls as well and got no answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1385)|
| 0:23:13| Mr. Chairman, what, in the past, what have you folks done about, how many chances do you give people and this sort of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1393)|
| 0:23:21| I mean, just like you said earlier, it's not a burden for us, but as far as the staff and what they have to go through each time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1401)|
| 0:23:29| how many times, is it three strikes you're out or what are we doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1409)|
| 0:23:33| I mean, it's really just at the pleasure of the board as to what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1413)|
| 0:23:38| There's no set rules or regulations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| Unfortunately, there's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| You know, just kind of, I always look to the district person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1423)|
| 0:23:46| That doesn't necessarily mean that you have to be the one to respond to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| but I certainly want to give you that first, you know, ability to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1429)|
| 0:23:56| Oh, that's my bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1436)|
| 0:23:57| That's Fourth District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1439)|
| 0:24:01| So I'm going to put it on you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1441)|
| 0:24:06| Well, when we contact folks and give them a chance to come back and they don't communicate with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1446)|
| 0:24:14| I start to feel like, you know, it's one thing, usually they're extenuating circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1454)|
| 0:24:18| but I assume that, Dottie, we have tried to reach them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1458)|
| 0:24:22| It goes above and beyond what would be normally necessary to contact someone who has initiated a beer permit themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1462)|
| 0:24:32| We are seeking after them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1472)|
| 0:24:34| What's the last contact we've had?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1474)|
| 0:24:38| Registered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1478)|
| 0:24:39| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1479)|
| 0:24:40| At the beer board meeting when they were approved subject to final documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1480)|
| 0:24:43| we haven't had any contact with them since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1483)|
| 0:24:47| I remember them being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1487)|
| 0:24:48| I think there was two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1488)|
| 0:24:49| I have driven by that location expecting it to be open, and it has not opened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1489)|
| 0:24:56| I don't know what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1496)|
| 0:24:57| It's just locked up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| Maybe I could talk to the mall manager, but it strikes me as odd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1499)|
| 0:25:02| It looks like a project that started and whether it ran into financial difficulty or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1502)|
| 0:25:06| I'll take it upon myself to check and report back if you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1506)|
| 0:25:10| Either that or we kill it, but I will take that upon myself to contact the mall manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1510)|
| 0:25:15| and find out what's happened to this tenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1515)|
| 0:25:20| Last, Mayor Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1520)|
| 0:25:22| Yeah, I am leaving, so, you know, obviously postponements really are none of my concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1522)|
| 0:25:29| but I always tend to look at this as sort of somebody's done all the paperwork except that last little thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1529)|
| 0:25:35| and I sort of hate that idea of not giving an extension, not giving a postponement when it's paperwork driven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1535)|
| 0:25:43| You never know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1543)|
| 0:25:44| This is somebody that's run into some problems with a contractor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1544)|
| 0:25:47| and they haven't finished their building, and they're just not open in the mail right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1547)|
| 0:25:51| and we could end up really affecting their business by taking hasty action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1551)|
| 0:25:56| So I'm always going to favor extensions on this kind of situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1556)|
| 0:26:01| But like I said, I'm leaving, so that's just my wisdom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1561)|
| 0:26:05| Well, and like I said, I don't have specific facts today, but I will get them and report back to the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1565)|
| 0:26:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1570)|
| 0:26:11| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1571)|
| 0:26:12| Well, I agree with Mr. Becker and I think Councilwoman Bailey and others that we need to give people chances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1572)|
| 0:26:17| because there are extenuating circumstances at many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1577)|
| 0:26:22| On the other hand, when you make application for the license, you know what the expectations are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1582)|
| 0:26:28| and I have a concern that if you're not as diligent about meeting all of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1588)|
| 0:26:33| will you be as diligent about checking IDs and filing the taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1593)|
| 0:26:38| and the other things that go along with operating the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| In some cases, people may just be overwhelmed when they actually get into it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1601)|
| 0:26:45| and see that there was a lot more to it than just pouring beer, and that's a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1605)|
| 0:26:52| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1612)|
| 0:26:53| I'm conflicted every time one of these come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1613)|
| 0:26:55| How many chances do you get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| I guess in the old age when you have children, you keep giving them chances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1618)|
| 0:27:02| and enough rope until they hang themselves and then we say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1622)|
| 0:27:06| And I don't want to be anti-business because I have a real concern about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1626)|
| 0:27:10| But at the same time, I have a concern that people are not being responsible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1630)|
| 0:27:14| you know, not going in for your photos, not going in for the classes and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1634)|
| 0:27:19| Don't send a signal to me that you're a really responsible person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1639)|
| 0:27:24| to be doing these particular kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1647)|
| 0:27:28| Justice Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1648)|
| 0:27:30| I just want to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1650)|
| 0:27:31| I'm frequently in that mall because I'm a mall walker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1651)|
| 0:27:35| and there was some activity there, and it appeared it just stopped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1655)|
| 0:27:41| But I hope that they can open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1661)|
| 0:27:44| I had heard something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1664)|
| 0:27:45| I had informal information that they were having to jackhammer open the floors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1665)|
| 0:27:49| the piping or something was bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1669)|
| 0:27:51| But I don't have specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1671)|
| 0:27:52| But I will check, and I will get back to this body soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1672)|
| 0:27:56| Customer Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1676)|
| 0:27:57| Has there been a motion made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1677)|
| 0:27:58| I will move to postpone until the next meeting, in which case I'll have information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1678)|
| 0:28:03| Extend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1683)|
| 0:28:04| Extend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1684)|
| 0:28:05| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1685)|
| 0:28:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1686)|
| 0:28:07| For January the 25th, there's a motion to second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1687)|
| 0:28:08| Any further discussion on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1688)|
| 0:28:09| If not, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1689)|
| 0:28:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1691)|
| 0:28:12| Nama?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| 506 South Gay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1694)|
| 0:28:18| I think Nama does have a representative here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1698)|
| 0:28:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1700)|
| 0:28:23| Your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1703)|
| 0:28:27| Tasha Matthews, 506 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1707)|
| 0:28:31| And I'm requesting an extension of 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1711)|
| 0:28:36| And that would be due to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| Instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1718)|
| 0:28:39| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1719)|
| 0:28:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1720)|
| 0:28:41| Any further discussion on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1721)|
| 0:28:43| If not, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1723)|
| 0:28:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1725)|
| 0:28:46| So 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1726)|
| 0:28:52| And Rick's Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1732)|
| 0:29:00| Nobody here from Rick's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1740)|
| 0:29:01| I'll tell you what I'll do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1741)|
| 0:29:02| I'll make a motion to move this to the heel of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1742)|
| 0:29:05| A couple of administrative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| Yeah, we've got one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| Well, I'll move it to the heel regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1754)|
| 0:29:15| Benefit of the doubt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1755)|
| 0:29:16| Discussion on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1756)|
| 0:29:17| If not, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1757)|
| 0:29:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1759)|
| 0:29:20| Hold on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1760)|
| 0:29:28| And then we're back to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1768)|
| 0:29:31| Yeah, Santa Fe, 3920 Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1771)|
| 0:29:35| I know, Counsel, isn't this the one that you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1775)|
| 0:29:38| Yeah, and that gentleman did come back to talk to us and told us about the problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1778)|
| 0:29:42| with the estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1782)|
| 0:29:43| And I'm actually reported on some of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1783)|
| 0:29:45| But again, at that point, he was clearly on notice of what was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1785)|
| 0:29:49| I don't know why he has not followed through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1789)|
| 0:29:54| I'm of the same opinion of Ms. Palmer in the sense that at some point, you've got to paddle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1794)|
| 0:29:59| your own canoe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1799)|
| 0:30:03| Maybe the estate has gotten them bogged down and the roof work did not get done or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1803)|
| 0:30:07| But you would expect someone to come back to us or to write to the staff and tell them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1807)|
| 0:30:12| here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1812)|
| 0:30:13| So I think we can just?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| I'm assuming that that's the fourth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| Is it the fourth or the sixth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1817)|
| 0:30:19| Well, it's actually the sixth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1819)|
| 0:30:20| I think it's in the sixth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1820)|
| 0:30:21| It is the sixth, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1821)|
| 0:30:22| My bad on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1822)|
| 0:30:23| Isn't that the former location of Fats?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1826)|
| 0:30:27| I would really like to see something in that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1827)|
| 0:30:30| But this has gone on for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1830)|
| 0:30:34| August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1834)|
| 0:30:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1835)|
| 0:30:36| Quite some time on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1836)|
| 0:30:41| So I'm not hearing a motion at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1841)|
| 0:30:44| Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1844)|
| 0:30:45| I'm going to make a motion to extend for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1847)|
| 0:30:48| If something's happened and somebody's contacted somebody, I'm just inclined to say this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1848)|
| 0:30:53| about paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1853)|
| 0:30:55| Well, I hear Ms. Palmer and are they going to get other paperwork wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1855)|
| 0:31:00| I think lots of people can get at a point where they think bend to the beer board, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1860)|
| 0:31:04| all taken care of, and they're thinking about other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| So I'm always inclined to give them that break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1867)|
| 0:31:16| So that was a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1876)|
| 0:31:17| It was a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1877)|
| 0:31:19| I would like to amend that for instead of 60 days to 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1879)|
| 0:31:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1887)|
| 0:31:28| I'll accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1888)|
| 0:31:29| And then look at it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| So we would, there's not, we'd need, I'd need a second, number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1891)|
| 0:31:35| Did you second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| I mean, I think I can actually accept that as a friendly change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1897)|
| 0:31:41| I'll make that change on my motion then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1901)|
| 0:31:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1904)|
| 0:31:45| So the motion is to extend this for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1905)|
| 0:31:49| Well, until January the 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1909)|
| 0:31:51| Seeing no lights, no discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1911)|
| 0:31:53| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1913)|
| 0:31:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1914)|
| 0:31:55| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1915)|
| 0:31:56| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1916)|
| 0:31:57| It may be that the staff should contact the probate office or someone and find out who the current owner is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1917)|
| 0:32:04| We've contacted the real estate agent that's trying to, we've called every number we have available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1924)|
| 0:32:10| We've sent a revenue officer to the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1930)|
| 0:32:15| There's no activity that I can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| And find no one that will?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| No, I was going to say there's a probate office in this building that probably has the name of the son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1939)|
| 0:32:25| I don't know whether you have contact information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| He is the current either owner or the manager of the estate that the family has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1947)|
| 0:32:32| And he could find out whether this lease is still existing or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1952)|
| 0:32:35| Maybe it's folded or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1955)|
| 0:32:37| But that would be easy enough since it is in this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1957)|
| 0:32:40| You have the name of the original owner, that lady that died of cancer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1960)|
| 0:32:44| It would be her estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1964)|
| 0:32:45| Just find out who the son is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| He'll be the contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1967)|
| 0:32:48| That would be the most direct way to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| And that would be worth doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| If it's just a walk down the stairs or a phone call to the probate office, we'll get some read on what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1972)|
| 0:32:58| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1978)|
| 0:32:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1979)|
| 0:33:00| Councilman Bynum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1980)|
| 0:33:02| Well, I was just going to say that if, in most cases, if the district councilman doesn't want to investigate that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1982)|
| 0:33:09| you know, as an at-large member, I'd be happy to check into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1989)|
| 0:33:12| I think some of us know who the owner is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| And I'd certainly be willing on this one to look into it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=1994)|
| 0:33:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2000)|
| 0:33:25| So we've extended it until January 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2005)|
| 0:33:29| And, Councilman Beatty, thank you for offering that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2009)|
| 0:33:33| We hope we have good news on January 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2013)|
| 0:33:37| We have two administrative hearings tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| First up is the Circle T Market, who was before us, I believe, 30 days ago, or at the last meeting anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2020)|
| 0:33:51| the scheduled meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| Ms. Toole had given us a remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2033)|
| 0:34:00| And it was suggested that perhaps she might want to give that some further thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2040)|
| 0:34:06| And she has given us some more information here on her remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2046)|
| 0:34:13| And if you'll give your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2053)|
| 0:34:16| Theresa Toole, 204 South North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2056)|
| 0:34:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2060)|
| 0:34:21| And you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2061)|
| 0:34:23| Well, did you all get a copy of my plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2063)|
| 0:34:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2066)|
| 0:34:27| I'm going to have to say that the main thing that's helped me with this was the kid I picked up that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2067)|
| 0:34:32| I brought all my tests with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2072)|
| 0:34:35| After we watched the DVD and I gave them their training manual, they did their test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2075)|
| 0:34:40| We still had some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2080)|
| 0:34:43| Some of my employees that we went over and reviewed again until I made sure that they all understood that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2083)|
| 0:34:48| So it has been a great help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2088)|
| 0:34:56| That's good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| That's good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2098)|
| 0:34:59| Councilman DelBocchi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2099)|
| 0:35:00| I might ask, do you have provision, Ms. Toole, if you get a new employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2100)|
| 0:35:05| or start having some turnover where you get these new people up to speed, get their training in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2105)|
| 0:35:11| Is that part of your plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2111)|
| 0:35:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2112)|
| 0:35:13| I only have four employees at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2113)|
| 0:35:14| I think there was 10 to 12 packets in there plus a DVD that each employee can look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2114)|
| 0:35:20| take home with them or look at at the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| So you'll continue that education process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| So there's plenty enough information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2124)|
| 0:35:25| We had to make copies, but for my small store, we have plenty left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2125)|
| 0:35:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2130)|
| 0:35:31| And you're committed to get, if you get a new employee, to get them up to speed too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2131)|
| 0:35:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2134)|
| 0:35:35| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2135)|
| 0:35:36| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2136)|
| 0:35:37| I'd like to thank you for jumping in, taking the kit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2137)|
| 0:35:40| taking this very seriously and getting your employees trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2140)|
| 0:35:44| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2144)|
| 0:35:45| I was very surprised at some of the questions that they didn't get right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2145)|
| 0:35:49| It was a very, very good training tool for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2149)|
| 0:35:53| Councilwoman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2155)|
| 0:35:56| Ms. Toole is a representative to the Metropolitan Drug Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| Again, with all of my colleagues, we're so pleased that these materials were helpful to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2158)|
| 0:36:02| Thank you for taking them home and looking at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| Was there anything, as you went through the questions with the employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2164)|
| 0:36:07| that we could do in preparing our materials to help other businesses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2167)|
| 0:36:12| We're very, the Drug Commission is very committed to supporting businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2172)|
| 0:36:15| that have had compliance issues, and we want to provide them, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2175)|
| 0:36:19| the very best materials to aid in training their employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2179)|
| 0:36:22| I think this worked great because they each have a training manual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2182)|
| 0:36:26| They also have the exam to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| They watch the DVD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| Like she said, there's a couple of things that's fixing to be outdated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| I've asked some of my beer distributors to provide us with the calendars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2193)|
| 0:36:38| the day-by-day calendars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| That would help some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2202)|
| 0:36:43| I think the other thing we've learned on this board is that training never ceases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2203)|
| 0:36:46| You know, it's an ongoing thing when you're hiring new employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| but also with previously existing employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2210)|
| 0:36:53| Any time the Drug Commission can assist you by providing updated materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2213)|
| 0:36:56| or new materials or additional tasks, please, please let us know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2216)|
| 0:37:00| because we're committed to doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| I don't want to make it harder on anybody else, but I don't think sending me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2222)|
| 0:37:05| or a management once a year to a meeting expecting them to come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2225)|
| 0:37:10| and remember everything they were told and, you know, tell my other employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2230)|
| 0:37:15| they're going to miss something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| So it worked out well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| Any further discussion or questions of Ms. Toole?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2242)|
| 0:37:28| If not, we thank you for your diligence and for coming back with a more thorough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2248)|
| 0:37:35| and complete plan, which I think will help you, obviously, in the long run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2255)|
| 0:37:40| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2260)|
| 0:37:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2262)|
| 0:37:43| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2263)|
| 0:37:44| Next is the Roaming Gnome Hub and Eatery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2264)|
| 0:37:52| Roaming Gnome?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2272)|
| 0:37:56| You'll give your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| Michael Clement, 716 20th Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2279)|
| 0:38:03| Travis Webb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| Your address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| 1283 Beachview Drive, Sevierville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2287)|
| 0:38:10| Okay. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| Mr. Clement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| I'd like to address the Board and say that we do appreciate the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2295)|
| 0:38:19| that this Board does in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| The Roaming Gnome has eateries in both Sevierville and Merrillville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2301)|
| 0:38:27| and they strive to meet all the requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2307)|
| 0:38:32| and go above and beyond as much as possible when it comes to serving alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2312)|
| 0:38:37| Mr. Webb is the president and managing member of the LLC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2317)|
| 0:38:43| and is actually on site quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2323)|
| 0:38:47| If you look at the plan that we submitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2327)|
| 0:38:51| of the seven bullet points, three of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2331)|
| 0:38:55| one is 100% new, the remedial training in alcohol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2335)|
| 0:39:00| in-house twice a year with a qualified ass trainer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2340)|
| 0:39:05| That is something that they're going to take at their expense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2345)|
| 0:39:08| to upgrade their staff and to make sure that these things don't happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2348)|
| 0:39:15| The other one was where staff had been reminded monthly of these laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2355)|
| 0:39:22| They are now reminded weekly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2362)|
| 0:39:24| At every weekly meeting, it is brought up and they are reminded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2364)|
| 0:39:28| that these are very serious, very important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2368)|
| 0:39:31| and very business-ending events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2371)|
| 0:39:37| If we can't qualify our people and follow these rules, we won't be doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2377)|
| 0:39:44| The next one that we have really stepped up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2384)|
| 0:39:48| is while the staff relies on door personnel to properly screen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2388)|
| 0:39:52| they have gone back and told all of their servers to recheck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2392)|
| 0:39:57| if you have even a hint that someone might not be of age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2397)|
| 0:40:02| even though they've passed the door and they've obviously been screened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2402)|
| 0:40:06| to go back and re-screen them randomly throughout the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2406)|
| 0:40:13| We're trying to have redundancies so that if one failsafe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2413)|
| 0:40:19| doesn't catch the issue, that another one will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2419)|
| 0:40:24| I have one, if I may, I have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2424)|
| 0:40:29| We recognize the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| I don't have a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2431)|
| 0:40:34| I'm curious, when you go to plus 21 after 8 o'clock, I think, on the campus site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2434)|
| 0:40:41| walk me through that process as to what happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2441)|
| 0:40:45| from the point that the patron gets there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2445)|
| 0:40:48| From the time the doorman arrives, they will start checking IDs at 8 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2448)|
| 0:40:52| The managers will scan the building for any minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2452)|
| 0:40:56| Obviously, we have occasional families and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2456)|
| 0:40:59| They're not asked to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| It's just from that point on to persuade the minors to get in there early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2461)|
| 0:41:07| It's basically coming in to watch the door, to card everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2467)|
| 0:41:11| and to note anybody inside the building that's currently underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2471)|
| 0:41:16| I'm still curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2476)|
| 0:41:18| When they go up and actually purchase a beverage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2478)|
| 0:41:22| are they checked again while they're being served?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2482)|
| 0:41:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2485)|
| 0:41:26| You're checking them at the door initially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2486)|
| 0:41:30| The server, if they're at a table or if they go to get served themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2490)|
| 0:41:34| then they're rechecked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2494)|
| 0:41:37| So it's not a situation where they're getting a bracelet or anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2497)|
| 0:41:41| The only time that we've ever had to use that was on a game day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2501)|
| 0:41:45| just because of the mass amounts of people that are there throughout the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2505)|
| 0:41:50| Therefore, we do ban, and everybody has to have a ban| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2510)|
| 0:41:54| in order to purchase an alcoholic beverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2514)|
| 0:41:56| So it's one of these, I would assume it's like a paper deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2516)|
| 0:41:59| where if you took it off or manipulated it, then...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2519)|
| 0:42:03| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2523)|
| 0:42:04| Councilman DeVolopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2524)|
| 0:42:05| Yeah, my question is similar to yours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2525)|
| 0:42:08| because when I read this, I got the impression that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2528)|
| 0:42:11| well, during the daytime it's more eatery than pub,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2531)|
| 0:42:14| and so we do some checking at the table before we serve people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2534)|
| 0:42:18| But I was picturing the wily college kid coming in at 7 o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2538)|
| 0:42:23| and hanging around eating a pizza until 8 o'clock when he could start drinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2543)|
| 0:42:27| And the way this read to me, one of the bullet points said that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2547)|
| 0:42:31| staff relies on the door personnel to screen all persons entering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2551)|
| 0:42:35| and then they randomly check patrons as they serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2555)|
| 0:42:39| But it didn't sound like there was a cure for the problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2559)|
| 0:42:43| where someone comes in early, hangs around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2563)|
| 0:42:46| and then tries to switch to becoming a drinking patron,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2566)|
| 0:42:50| hoping everyone will assume that they're of age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2570)|
| 0:42:54| because everyone after a certain hour is carded right at the door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2574)|
| 0:42:58| and doesn't even get in the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2578)|
| 0:43:00| Could you answer that problem scenario?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2580)|
| 0:43:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2582)|
| 0:43:03| Every staff member is trained by the state and by us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2583)|
| 0:43:06| to card every person that is asked for alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2586)|
| 0:43:10| The only thing that we try to do to them at late night when it gets busy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2590)|
| 0:43:14| is to benefit the staff with the additional IDing of 21 and up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2594)|
| 0:43:19| So an extra layer at the door, that's all that's happening at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2599)|
| 0:43:22| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2602)|
| 0:43:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2603)|
| 0:43:24| You've got a fail-safe system, in other words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2604)|
| 0:43:27| But you also card them at the service point of action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| If I may, that's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| The individual will be carded when they request to purchase an alcohol beverage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2612)|
| 0:43:37| even if they've made it through the door and they're at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2617)|
| 0:43:40| They're going to be carded when they ask to purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| That was the point of inquiry, is there a way to slide under and kind of hang out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2622)|
| 0:43:47| I remember the day when people used to come in the trunks of cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2627)|
| 0:43:51| to get in the drive-in theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| People think their way around obstacles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2633)|
| 0:43:56| We're not going to say it can't be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2636)|
| 0:43:58| but we're trying to add redundant fail-safes in the door and then the server.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2638)|
| 0:44:02| Anytime anyone asks to purchase an alcohol beverage, they will be carded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2642)|
| 0:44:06| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2646)|
| 0:44:07| Councilwoman Reilly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2649)|
| 0:44:10| Chairman Pavlis and Councilmember Della Volpe have really asked my question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2650)|
| 0:44:14| and it has to do with this bullet point number five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| I think all of us may be concerned about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2656)|
| 0:44:19| and I think what I've heard you say for the record is that you're amending this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2659)|
| 0:44:24| in that what we read here is that after the 8 o'clock, I believe it's 8 o'clock, cutoff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2664)|
| 0:44:31| the bartender is relying on the door person to have carded everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2671)|
| 0:44:35| And the way your plan reads is the assumption is everybody is legal after 8 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2675)|
| 0:44:40| And as Mr. Della Volpe pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2680)|
| 0:44:42| anybody that has come in earlier when there isn't someone at the door could remain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2682)|
| 0:44:47| and all your plan says is that management will randomly recheck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2687)|
| 0:44:50| Your plan does not say that every patron is double carded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2690)|
| 0:44:53| And, you know, what I'm hearing from my colleagues is that we would be much more comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2693)|
| 0:44:58| with a policy that says that after 8 o'clock, you bring in that door person to check IDs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2698)|
| 0:45:04| but that in addition, every person is carded for every purchase of an alcoholic drink,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2704)|
| 0:45:10| unless there's some kind of wristbanding thing going on at the door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2710)|
| 0:45:14| in which case it would be very clear if you had come through the door and received a wristband| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2714)|
| 0:45:17| or if you had come in before that time and did not have a wristband.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2717)|
| 0:45:23| What I would respectfully request, then, is remove the word random.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2723)|
| 0:45:28| And we will make that change, and they will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2728)|
| 0:45:31| In that fifth bullet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2731)|
| 0:45:32| That policy will not be random.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| They will be carded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2734)|
| 0:45:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2735)|
| 0:45:36| So you're not going to use bracelets at the door, but after 8 o'clock, I mean, the whole staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2736)|
| 0:45:42| the bartender, the whole staff needs to know that even though there's someone at the door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| sort of controlling the flow, everyone has to be carded for every drink,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2745)|
| 0:45:49| because you've got this situation where the person at the door is not fail-safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2749)|
| 0:45:53| because a patron is coming in another time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2755)|
| 0:45:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2756)|
| 0:45:57| I can live with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2757)|
| 0:46:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2762)|
| 0:46:03| I don't see any further, any lights, any cane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2763)|
| 0:46:07| There's no further discussion on this administrative hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2767)|
| 0:46:10| We appreciate you taking the opportunity to come down here and be before this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2770)|
| 0:46:14| and I think you understand that we take this very seriously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2774)|
| 0:46:17| and I think that you all have satisfactorily, for the time being, met requirements to move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2777)|
| 0:46:25| and we wish you luck with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| And, again, thank you for your time and patience of this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2790)|
| 0:46:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2791)|
| 0:46:32| We had moved Rick's place to heal the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2792)|
| 0:46:36| He was number four, and it was for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2796)|
| 0:46:44| They were approved at the September 21st meeting, and after hearing discussion on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2804)|
| 0:46:49| from the chairman's position, I'm going to go ahead and make a motion to postpone this for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2809)|
| 0:46:56| extend it, rather, until January the 25th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2816)|
| 0:47:00| I hear a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2820)|
| 0:47:01| Is there further discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| If not, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2823)|
| 0:47:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2825)|
| 0:47:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2826)|
| 0:47:07| Any further meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2827)|
| 0:47:08| Anyone wish to address this board tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| If not, we stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd101228?start=2830)|
