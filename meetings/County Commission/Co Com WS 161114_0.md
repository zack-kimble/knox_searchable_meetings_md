| 0:10:19| a Board of Education workshop that's going on concurrently with this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=619)|

| 0:10:29| The iZone grant is for the priority schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=629)|
| 0:10:34| Those are Lonsdale Green, Cerebral Green, and Vine Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=634)|
| 0:10:39| It's to provide some additional kinds of things to improve instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=639)|
| 0:10:44| I know there's a special ed component, I believe, to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=644)|
| 0:10:47| There's also a coaching component that goes along with the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=647)|
| 0:10:52| I think this past year was year one of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=652)|
| 0:10:54| So I guess we're entering into year two of the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=654)|
| 0:10:56| But it's just to really focus on those schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=656)|
| 0:10:59| and try to provide ways to improve the instruction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=659)|
| 0:11:03| what we deliver to the students in those schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=663)|
| 0:11:06| Well, you answered my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=666)|
| 0:11:07| Which schools and how long is the grant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=667)|
| 0:11:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=669)|
| 0:11:10| Year two, I think, is it five-year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=670)|
| 0:11:13| Three-year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=673)|
| 0:11:14| Three-year grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=674)|
| 0:11:15| 16, 17 is year two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=675)|
| 0:11:17| And then next year will be the final.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=677)|
| 0:11:20| So it's just additional staffing support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=680)|
| 0:11:22| and remediation for students at those particular schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=682)|
| 0:11:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=685)|

| 0:11:57| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=717)|
| 0:11:58| Madam Clerk, I believe it's item 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=718)|
| 0:12:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=724)|
| 0:12:05| It's a resolution approving a contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=725)|
| 0:12:06| with Mastery Connect, Incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=726)|
| 0:12:08| for the provision of an assessment management tool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=728)|
| 0:12:10| as needed by individual schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=730)|
| 0:12:12| for the term of November 1st, 2016| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=732)|
| 0:12:15| through October 31st, 2017| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=735)|
| 0:12:17| with the option to extend for four additional years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=737)|
| 0:12:21| one year at a time for a possible total of five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=741)|
| 0:12:26| I believe you asked for this, Commissioner Deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=746)|
| 0:12:28| but may I have a motion first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=748)|
| 0:12:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=750)|
| 0:12:31| I would like to have a motion to look at item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=751)|
| 0:12:35| resolution number 20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=755)|
| 0:12:37| for the contract with Mastery Connect, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=757)|
| 0:12:40| To approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=760)|
| 0:12:41| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=761)|
| 0:12:42| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=762)|
| 0:12:45| Commissioner Deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=765)|
| 0:12:47| My question was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=767)|
| 0:12:49| what is the actual assessment of the management tool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=769)|
| 0:12:52| and is it particular to one school or several?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=772)|
| 0:12:56| We have Shannon Jackson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=776)|
| 0:12:58| Shannon is our Executive Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=778)|
| 0:13:00| for Curriculum and Instruction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=780)|
| 0:13:02| but it's for multiple schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=782)|
| 0:13:03| I think any school that wishes to use this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=783)|
| 0:13:08| will be able to do so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=788)|
| 0:13:09| and I think it's at the school expense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=789)|
| 0:13:11| if I'm correct, but I'll let Shannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=791)|
| 0:13:13| Is it a particular rubrics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=793)|
| 0:13:14| and is there a cost to issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=794)|
| 0:13:18| I just want the details of looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=798)|
| 0:13:20| what the rubrics would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=800)|
| 0:13:22| Is it specific to teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=802)|
| 0:13:23| or are you just assessing how well the school is performing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=803)|
| 0:13:26| The assessment is around the state standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=806)|
| 0:13:29| and the schools were using it to progress monitor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=809)|
| 0:13:32| where their students were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=812)|
| 0:13:33| Many of them wanted to go in and purchase this technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=813)|
| 0:13:36| which required us to then run through the RFP process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=816)|
| 0:13:39| Got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=819)|
| 0:13:40| And is it specific to just middle or high school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=820)|
| 0:13:43| or all schools that wanted to participate in it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=823)|
| 0:13:45| All schools who'd like to participate may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=825)|
| 0:13:47| Got it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=827)|
| 0:13:51| Seeing no further discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=831)|
| 0:13:53| motion is properly before us to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=833)|
| 0:13:55| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=835)|
| 0:13:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=837)|
| 0:13:58| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=838)|
| 0:13:59| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=839)|
| 0:14:01| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=841)|
| 0:14:05| Item number 22, listed on page 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=845)|
| 0:14:08| is Resolution 301.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=848)|
| 0:14:10| It's approving acceptance of a grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=850)|
| 0:14:12| in an amount not to exceed $132,452| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=852)|
| 0:14:16| from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=856)|
| 0:14:20| under the Port Security Grant Program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=860)|
| 0:14:22| with required matching funds in the amount of $33,113| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=862)|
| 0:14:26| for the period beginning September 1, 2016| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=866)|
| 0:14:29| and ending August 31, 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=869)|
| 0:14:33| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=873)|
| 0:14:36| Motion to approve. Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=876)|
| 0:14:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=878)|
| 0:14:41| Yes, my only question is the $33,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=881)|
| 0:14:43| is that in the department budget already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=883)|
| 0:14:45| or is that something that will come back before commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=885)|
| 0:14:48| No, Knox County budgets that in their grants budget every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=888)|
| 0:14:52| so that money is available out of Knox County's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=892)|
| 0:14:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=896)|
| 0:14:57| Just making sure that this wasn't something new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=897)|
| 0:14:59| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=899)|
| 0:15:02| Seeing no further discussion, the motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=902)|
| 0:15:05| All in favor say aye. Aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=905)|
| 0:15:07| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=907)|
| 0:15:09| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=909)|
| 0:15:11| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=911)|
| 0:15:21| Item number 32, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=921)|
| 0:15:23| Yes, item number 32, Resolution 802,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=923)|
| 0:15:26| is approving the amendment and restatement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=926)|
| 0:15:30| of Knox County Series D-3-A loan agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=930)|
| 0:15:33| with the public building authority of Blount County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=933)|
| 0:15:36| directing the establishment of a new index period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=936)|
| 0:15:39| on the related local government public improvement bond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=939)|
| 0:15:42| Series D-3-A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=942)|
| 0:15:44| and authorizing the execution and delivery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=944)|
| 0:15:47| of a new index rate agreement in connection therewith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=947)|
| 0:15:50| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=950)|
| 0:15:52| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=952)|
| 0:15:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=954)|
| 0:15:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=955)|
| 0:15:57| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=957)|
| 0:16:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=960)|
| 0:16:02| Mr. Caldwell, would you mind giving us a little more elimination on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=962)|
| 0:16:05| At my first read, it looks like we're refinancing some debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=965)|
| 0:16:08| probably looking for a better rate with a different bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=968)|
| 0:16:12| Also, to help edify the new commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=972)|
| 0:16:16| what was interesting is when we read this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=976)|
| 0:16:18| it says an agreement with the public building authority of Blount County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=978)|
| 0:16:22| when I know we're Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=982)|
| 0:16:24| Would you just sort of give a little extra explanation on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=984)|
| 0:16:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=987)|
| 0:16:28| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=988)|
| 0:16:29| I'll let Joe Ayers, FAA, explain some of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=989)|
| 0:16:33| I will tell you this just to make it as simple as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=993)|
| 0:16:37| Basically, we are just changing banks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=997)|
| 0:16:40| This is more of a behind-the-scenes thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1000)|
| 0:16:42| As far as the county is concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1002)|
| 0:16:44| our payments will remain relatively the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1004)|
| 0:16:47| There could be a modest change in a variable interest rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1007)|
| 0:16:51| but this is something that goes along with this series of bonds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1011)|
| 0:16:56| that we have to update the index, which updates the bank periodically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1016)|
| 0:17:01| I'll let Joe speak to more in detail of the other parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1021)|
| 0:17:07| Thank you, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1027)|
| 0:17:08| Joe Ayers, 918 Cherokee Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1028)|
| 0:17:11| These bonds were originally issued about eight years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1031)|
| 0:17:15| As Mr. Caldwell mentioned, they're in the variable rate bond mode,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1035)|
| 0:17:20| currently owned by PNC Bank with an expiration of their tenor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1040)|
| 0:17:26| on December 1st of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| We went out to the market and sought proposals from other banks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1048)|
| 0:17:32| This resolution authorizes switching the purchaser of these bonds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1052)|
| 0:17:35| from PNC Bank to Bank of America Merrill Lynch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1055)|
| 0:17:39| and it would lower the credit spread on the bonds by 10 basis points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1059)|
| 0:17:43| which equates to about $62,000 per annum in savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1063)|
| 0:17:50| Happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1070)|
| 0:17:51| Thank you, Mr. Ayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1071)|
| 0:17:55| I believe he answered the real question that was on everyone's minds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1075)|
| 0:18:00| It's ten basis points in savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1080)|
| 0:18:05| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1085)|
| 0:18:08| Given the recent bond fluctuations, when were those locked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1088)|
| 0:18:15| These particular bonds reset on a monthly basis based on a percentage of LIBOR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1095)|
| 0:18:22| The county has in its bond portfolio three different types of bonds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1102)|
| 0:18:27| pure fixed rate bonds, pure variable rate bonds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1107)|
| 0:18:29| and then hybrid bonds where you have bonds synthetically fixed rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1109)|
| 0:18:35| The portion of the county's debt portfolio that's in the pure variable rate mode,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1115)|
| 0:18:39| the county uses the assets on your balance sheet in the form of fund balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1119)|
| 0:18:43| general fund balance, and debt service fund balance to manage that interest rate risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1123)|
| 0:18:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1130)|
| 0:18:51| Seeing no further discussion, motion is probably before us to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1131)|

| 0:19:02| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| Item 35 is Resolution 901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1144)|
| 0:19:06| It's approving a residential lease agreement with Valentine Carter & Sons, LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1146)|
| 0:19:11| for the Knox County Recovery Court to lease a house located at 2236 Mississippi Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1151)|
| 0:19:17| for use as transitional housing for the period beginning May 1, 2016| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1157)|
| 0:19:21| and ending April 30, 2018 at a cost of $850 per month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1161)|
| 0:19:29| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1169)|
| 0:19:31| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1171)|
| 0:19:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1172)|
| 0:19:34| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1174)|
| 0:19:36| Yeah, I just had a question that the date of this agreement was May 1 of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1176)|
| 0:19:43| So have we actually been making these payments now since May 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1183)|
| 0:19:47| and now the paperwork is coming to us seven months later?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1187)|
| 0:19:52| Is there anybody here from that department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1192)|
| 0:19:56| Mr. Caldwell, could I call on you to maybe get us an answer by an e-mail answer sometime this week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1196)|
| 0:20:10| Can I make a substitute motion to move without recommendation, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1210)|
| 0:20:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1214)|
| 0:20:24| Mr. Caldwell, will you be able to ferret out an answer for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1224)|
| 0:20:30| I think that's through the court system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1230)|
| 0:20:32| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1232)|
| 0:20:33| I mean, he can get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1233)|
| 0:20:34| I'm asking him for his assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| I do believe this is through our drug court, and so my thought process is probably a grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1237)|
| 0:20:46| and so I will check on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1246)|
| 0:20:49| Probably would be Ron Hanover is my guess, but I'll check on that and e-mail you all a response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1249)|
| 0:20:58| Mr. Hammond or Richard Major, would you be able to help us with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1258)|
| 0:21:07| Richard Major, 11406 Oxford Station Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1267)|
| 0:21:11| Mr. Caldwell is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1271)|
| 0:21:13| Ron Hanover is the contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1273)|
| 0:21:14| The drug court program functions as an independent agency of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1274)|
| 0:21:18| They do receive state grant funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| They also receive money collected through the court clerk's office as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| but they're independent of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1284)|
| 0:21:25| Ron Hanover is the contact, and this likely is funded through grant money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| or money coming through the clerk's office that we collect on fees, one of those two, I would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1289)|
| 0:21:33| But he would be your contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1293)|
| 0:21:36| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1298)|
| 0:21:39| I did go by the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1299)|
| 0:21:40| It is vacant at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1300)|
| 0:21:43| And I would be happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1303)|
| 0:21:44| Judge Cerny also oversees the drug court program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1304)|
| 0:21:47| I would be happy to relay your question to both him and Ron| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1307)|
| 0:21:50| and ensure you get an answer by next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1310)|
| 0:21:52| We would truly appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1312)|
| 0:21:54| If you would relay a quest that they get information to commissioners this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1314)|
| 0:21:59| sometime during the week, by e-mail so that we may have information to act on next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1319)|
| 0:22:06| That will not be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1326)|
| 0:22:07| Point of order, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1327)|
| 0:22:08| Can we have them come to the meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1328)|
| 0:22:10| Most certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1330)|
| 0:22:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1331)|
| 0:22:12| I can pass that request to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1332)|
| 0:22:13| Relay them a request that we ask they come to the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1333)|
| 0:22:16| I will do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1336)|
| 0:22:18| Thank you so much, Mr. Major.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1338)|
| 0:22:25| We have before us a substitute motion to send on without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1345)|
| 0:22:31| Who made the original motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1351)|
| 0:22:33| Would you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1353)|
| 0:22:34| I would withdraw my original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| We will just have before us a motion made by Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1356)|
| 0:22:42| And the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1362)|
| 0:22:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1363)|
| 0:22:46| You're okay with it being a no recommendation motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1366)|
| 0:23:02| We have a second on the substitute motion as it used to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1382)|
| 0:23:06| but now it's the motion before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| The motion that is before us now is to send forward to full commission no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1388)|
| 0:23:17| Seeing no further discussion, all in favor of sending no recommendation say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1397)|
| 0:23:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1404)|
| 0:23:25| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1407)|
| 0:23:30| Item 36, Resolution 902 is approving an amendment to the contract with Data Bank IMX LLC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1410)|
| 0:23:36| for the development, installation, and maintenance of an electronic content management system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1416)|
| 0:23:42| for the Circuit Court Clerk's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1422)|
| 0:23:44| Which amendment provides for implementation of an online document management system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1424)|
| 0:23:48| for the Fourth Circuit, Sessions, and Criminal Courts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1428)|
| 0:23:52| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1432)|
| 0:23:53| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1433)|
| 0:23:56| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1436)|
| 0:23:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission, Mike Hammond, 8103 Burchell Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1439)|
| 0:24:04| One of the things that we have wanted to do for some time now is to take our office digital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1444)|
| 0:24:09| to get away from paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1449)|
| 0:24:11| As you know, almost everything we do involves paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1451)|
| 0:24:13| As a matter of fact, through this month, in our offices, we have already used over one million sheets of paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1453)|
| 0:24:22| And so this will be the first step in our weaning away from the paper process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1462)|
| 0:24:26| becoming digital, which obviously is going to save money and give us a lot more efficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1466)|
| 0:24:31| The amount of the contract is $355,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| The money is in the Mayor's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| This contract has been vetted by our Purchasing Department and by our IT Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1476)|
| 0:24:40| We would ask that you approve it, and to help you with that decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1480)|
| 0:24:44| each quarter I come before you and present to you what I call our efficiency dividend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1484)|
| 0:24:49| Some refer to it as excess fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1489)|
| 0:24:51| I prefer to call it an efficiency dividend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1491)|
| 0:24:54| On behalf of the employees of the court clerk's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1494)|
| 0:24:58| I would like to present to Mayor Burchett and Knox County a check for $400,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1498)|
| 0:25:05| So we ask that you approve this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1505)|
| 0:25:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1507)|
| 0:25:15| Are there questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1515)|
| 0:25:18| Is there further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1518)|
| 0:25:24| Oh, I see that the check has already been collected before we vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1524)|
| 0:25:32| Motion is properly before us to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1532)|
| 0:25:39| Seeing no further discussion, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1539)|
| 0:25:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1541)|
| 0:25:42| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1542)|
| 0:25:44| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1544)|
| 0:25:46| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1546)|
| 0:25:49| Item 37 is consideration of the closure of a portion of Lovelace Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1549)|
| 0:25:54| The closure will affect the last approximately 1,300 feet of Lovelace Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1554)|
| 0:25:59| where it terminates into Melton Hill Lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1559)|
| 0:26:03| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1563)|
| 0:26:04| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1566)|
| 0:26:09| Seeing no further discussion, the motion is properly before us to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1569)|
| 0:26:15| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1575)|
| 0:26:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1576)|
| 0:26:17| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1579)|
| 0:26:20| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| Number 38, line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1583)|
| 0:26:27| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1587)|
| 0:26:28| Yeah, I'd like to make a motion to move with no recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1588)|
| 0:26:32| and then make a comment afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1592)|
| 0:26:35| Do I hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1595)|
| 0:26:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| Commissioner Schoonmaker, have you found another nine cent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1599)|
| 0:26:44| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1604)|
| 0:26:45| My question is, maybe it's a procedural thing we have with the finance department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1605)|
| 0:26:50| but the line item transfers were just presented to this body at five minutes of five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1610)|
| 0:26:56| and it's probably because of all the different people that have to sign off on those prior to our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1616)|
| 0:27:01| Is it possible that when we do the agenda set up through the commission office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1621)|
| 0:27:06| that we go ahead and get a copy of those line item transfers without the appropriate signatures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1626)|
| 0:27:12| and then those be updated at the point of the commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1632)|
| 0:27:16| where the signatures could then appear on those documents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1636)|
| 0:27:19| I just feel like we should, if we're going to be voting on something, we should be able to see it in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1639)|
| 0:27:27| Because we are the legislative body, that we should have that opportunity to see it before we vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1647)|
| 0:27:33| At least that's the way I feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| And we are the appropriating body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| Yeah, we can do that for sure, because what does happen is it's a process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1660)|
| 0:27:44| and so getting signatures can take some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1664)|
| 0:27:48| So what we will do is we will send you all, we'll attach them without the signatures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1668)|
| 0:27:54| and then you can see them, and then if anything were to change, you can finalize them at the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1674)|
| 0:28:00| as long as that's okay with Mr. Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| He's giving me this look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| It'll be all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1684)|
| 0:28:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1688)|
| 0:28:13| Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1693)|
| 0:28:15| Seeing no further discussion, the motion is properly before us to send with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1695)|
| 0:28:22| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1702)|
| 0:28:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1703)|
| 0:28:24| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1704)|
| 0:28:26| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1706)|
| 0:28:27| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| Item 39, spread of record, the Knox County Mayor's Order appointing Richard Montgomery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1709)|
| 0:28:33| to the Knox Chapman Utility District Board of Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1713)|
| 0:28:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1717)|
| 0:28:41| Item 40, you've already had the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1721)|
| 0:28:45| Item 41 is the spread of record, the Knox County Mayor's Employee Handbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1725)|
| 0:28:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1730)|
| 0:28:51| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1731)|
| 0:28:52| Item 42, spread of record, Knox County Law Director's Employee Handbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1732)|
| 0:28:59| Madam Clerk, that concludes what's on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1739)|
| 0:29:05| I need to take just a moment and remind people of things that may be upcoming for us just in this coming week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1745)|
| 0:29:12| But first, I would like to say thank you to my fellow commissioners that participated in the Pilot Pumper's Pumper Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1752)|
| 0:29:24| I'm not going to say that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1764)|
| 0:29:27| But I have before me a thank you note from United Way thanking the Pilot Pumper's for helping raise a record-breaking $93,350 on Pilot's Pumper Days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1767)|
| 0:29:47| Thank you, my fellow commissioners, for having participated in that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1787)|
| 0:29:52| Also, I'd like to take just a moment to draw attention to a Metropolitan Planning Commission item that was on the November 10th agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1792)|
| 0:30:04| It was in the Hardin Business Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1804)|
| 0:30:08| It was a subdivision to allow an incoming corporation to Knox County to get a site which would more properly suit their business needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1808)|
| 0:30:21| The Development Corporation has had a couple of contracts signed in the last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1821)|
| 0:30:28| One is with Magnum Venus Products.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1828)|
| 0:30:32| Another is with HTS, which is Heat Treated Systems, a multinational, international corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1832)|
| 0:30:40| both of which have contracts to purchase property and bring jobs to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1840)|
| 0:30:46| Commissioner Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1846)|
| 0:30:48| Yes, Mr. Chairman, I think it's a good point that you tell people about that because sometimes it zooms by and you don't think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1848)|
| 0:30:57| But the Development Corporation, Todd Napier and those people are doing an excellent job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1857)|
| 0:31:02| And with that one day that we voted, if you think about it, there were hundreds and hundreds of new jobs coming to Knox County, all excellent-paying jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1862)|
| 0:31:11| So it was good to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1871)|
| 0:31:14| Correct, and I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1874)|
| 0:31:16| Good-paying jobs because the Development Corporation is not a real estate company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1876)|
| 0:31:21| They have a charter which charges them to bring a certain number of jobs at a certain paying level when they do transfer property to incoming corporations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1881)|
| 0:31:31| And also for people to be aware of, tomorrow is principal for a day here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1891)|
| 0:31:39| I know several of you are going to school locations tomorrow morning as early as 7-10 to be there as the doors are unlocked and as kids begin to arrive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1899)|
| 0:31:52| So I thank you for being participants in the principal for a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1912)|
| 0:31:57| Also tomorrow at 1 p.m. the Investment Committee meets at 1 p.m. Investment Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1917)|
| 0:32:06| Wednesday, the Metropolitan Drug Coalition and legislative members that are members of the Knox County Legislative Delegation to State Government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1926)|
| 0:32:21| are having a Wednesday at 11-30 luncheon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1941)|
| 0:32:27| I know members of commission are members of Metropolitan Drug Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1947)|
| 0:32:32| Commissioner Thomas, I think you're a member of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1952)|
| 0:32:36| I appreciate those that are interested in working with the Metropolitan Drug Coalition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1956)|
| 0:32:45| Commissioner Thomas, I believe you have Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1965)|
| 0:32:49| Yeah, Wednesday is going to be a busy day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1969)|
| 0:32:51| It's not that legislative luncheon, but that afternoon from 5-7, Ed and I are going to hold our at-large meeting out in Halls area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1971)|
| 0:32:59| We're going to be at E.B. Eats and Treats, 4620 Mill Branch Lane from 5-7 on Wednesday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1979)|
| 0:33:07| Now that is next to Pioneer Heat and Air if those people live in Halls and know where you're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1987)|
| 0:33:12| All of you are invited and all other officials and the public are invited to come out and participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1992)|
| 0:33:19| Tell us any thoughts you may have about how we should be doing business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=1999)|
| 0:33:23| Thank you, Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| And then one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2005)|
| 0:33:26| One more, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2006)|
| 0:33:27| Oh, yeah, you have buses also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| On Thursday at 11 o'clock at Ted Russell Ford, we do have five bus drivers that are going to receive a certificate of appreciation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2009)|
| 0:33:37| and a $100 check from Andy White from Ted Russell Ford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2017)|
| 0:33:41| They've been highly graded by the school transportation department, also the school system sheriff's department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2021)|
| 0:33:48| and the contractors all highly grade these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2028)|
| 0:33:53| They represent over 52 years of driving a bus in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2033)|
| 0:33:59| That will be 11 o'clock at Ted Russell Ford, and if you can come by and attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2039)|
| 0:34:03| I think it would mean a lot to these drivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2043)|
| 0:34:06| Really, every time I call and talk to them about they've been selected, if you could hear their voice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2046)|
| 0:34:13| they really do appreciate being appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2053)|
| 0:34:19| Thank you, Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| And then one last meal if you have a need for one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| Can I just mention something to Commissioner Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2064)|
| 0:34:26| Yes, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2066)|
| 0:34:27| You may want to contact Abby Harris at the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2067)|
| 0:34:31| She put it's Tuesday, November 17th instead of Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2071)|
| 0:34:37| Yeah, I already did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2077)|
| 0:34:38| As a matter of fact, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| It is Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2080)|
| 0:34:41| It's not Tuesday as in the release that was sent out by Abby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2081)|
| 0:34:47| And as I was starting to say there just a moment ago, Friday at 1130,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2087)|
| 0:34:53| the Chili Cook-Off, sponsored by Judge Tim Irwin at Juvenile Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2093)|
| 0:34:58| It's a major fundraiser, silent auction, live auction, fundraiser, Judge Tim Irwin at Juvenile Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2098)|
| 0:35:08| And I know of nowhere else that you can go and gas up your bus for $5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2108)|
| 0:35:14| It's a great place to go and see a bunch of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2114)|
| 0:35:19| Friday at 1130, Judge Tim Irwin and the Chili Cook-Off at Juvenile Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2119)|
| 0:35:24| It's their fundraiser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2124)|
| 0:35:27| Commissioner Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2127)|
| 0:35:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2129)|
| 0:35:30| On a much more serious thought of what Commissioner Rightleft is with there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2130)|
| 0:35:36| I just wanted to announce about the wreaths for the cemeteries, the wreaths across America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2136)|
| 0:35:46| Next Monday, November 21st, is the last day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2146)|
| 0:35:52| The online cutoff is the 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| The 21st you can still mail the check in, and the 28th you can still do it online with credit card and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2154)|
| 0:36:01| We are way below what we need to fill all three veteran cemeteries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2161)|
| 0:36:08| And so it's $15 per wreath, and we'll be doing that on December the 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2168)|
| 0:36:15| So I just wanted to make an announcement to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2175)|
| 0:36:18| If you have not purchased any wreaths, to please go online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| You can do it on Knox County website, and you can mail your check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2182)|
| 0:36:29| Attention, Knox County Mayor's Office at 400 Main Street, Suite 615, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2189)|
| 0:36:38| So please spread this around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| We need as many as we can get because they deserve to have a wreath on their cemetery lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2200)|
| 0:36:49| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| One quick announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2211)|
| 0:36:52| If anyone's going to be here this Wednesday afternoon, I'm the Cub Master for PAC 757,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2212)|
| 0:36:58| and I will be bringing a group of Weeblos on a tour of the city county building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2218)|
| 0:37:04| Mayor Burchett has kindly agreed to bestow some wisdom on them at approximately 4 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2224)|
| 0:37:09| We'll then be touring the courtrooms after that with Mike Hammond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2229)|
| 0:37:14| and we'll then probably make our way here to this room for a quick look around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2234)|
| 0:37:18| So that will be between 4 o'clock and 5 o'clock this Wednesday afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2238)|
| 0:37:23| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2243)|
| 0:37:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2245)|
| 0:37:26| Two quick ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| This Friday starts the Tennessee Pink Marble exhibit at the East Tennessee Historical Museum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2248)|
| 0:37:34| Tennessee Pink Marble is used all around the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| It's going to be, I think, like a three- to four-month exhibit at the History Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2257)|
| 0:37:43| And then everyone is invited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| I'll send you an invitation December the 10th to Kandor Arts and Heritage Open House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2265)|
| 0:37:51| I want to see you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2271)|
| 0:37:56| And one last thing that I will have more information on come Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2276)|
| 0:38:01| is the joint meeting of the Knox County Legislative Delegation chaired by Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2281)|
| 0:38:10| I think he is the declared winner of a recent House State of Tennessee legislative seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2290)|
| 0:38:19| Eddie Smith is working with the delegation trying to find an agreeable date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2299)|
| 0:38:24| It may be the 19th of December, but I do not know the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2304)|
| 0:38:29| I'm just saying that sometime early in the middle of December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2309)|
| 0:38:35| the commission and the Knox County Legislative Delegation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2315)|
| 0:38:40| will get together for a couple of hours to have a meal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2320)|
| 0:38:44| and discuss the priorities that we may have with the members of the state delegation from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2324)|
| 0:38:53| Seeing no further discussion before us this evening, we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114?start=2333)|
