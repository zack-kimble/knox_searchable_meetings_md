| 0:01:20| All right, very good. Now Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=80)|
| 0:01:23| Everyone please rise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=83)|
| 0:01:27| Salute the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=87)|
| 0:01:29| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=89)|
| 0:01:48| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=108)|
| 0:01:49| The first item on our agenda is going to be public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=109)|
| 0:01:53| Followed by public forum, we will be reviewing amendments and withdrawals to our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=113)|
| 0:02:01| I will ask our support staff from the clerk's office to keep track of everyone who speaks at public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=121)|
| 0:02:07| We're thankful for you to be here, but you are limited to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=127)|
| 0:02:13| The first person on our list for public forum is Michalia Harrison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=133)|
| 0:02:21| Please let me know if I pronounced your name incorrectly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=141)|
| 0:02:26| Michalia Harrison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=146)|
| 0:02:31| Is she here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=151)|
| 0:02:35| Okay, she is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=155)|
| 0:02:38| Number two on the agenda for public forum is Mr. Herbert Monsier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=158)|
| 0:02:45| Good afternoon. My name is Herbert Monsier, Suite 775 Bank of America Center in Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=165)|
| 0:02:52| and I'm here to speak on seeking something to happen at a workshop, and my legal brain hasn't completely figured out how to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=172)|
| 0:03:04| to approve the settlement that the mayor has entered into by the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=184)|
| 0:03:11| Let me give you just a bit of a history of where we are and where we're going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=191)|
| 0:03:17| and I have Al Holifield behind me who can answer specifics as to the settlement agreement that has been signed by the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=197)|
| 0:03:27| and has been signed by our clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=207)|
| 0:03:29| First of all, when I was last here, the big question was whether or not Chancellor Weaver was going to certify a class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=209)|
| 0:03:36| I report to you that on September the 27th we had a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=216)|
| 0:03:40| Chancellor Weaver did certify a class, and in that class he appointed Mr. Holifield, who represents seven retirees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=220)|
| 0:03:49| and Mr. Stephen Garrett, who represents the widow of one retiree, as well as my client,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=229)|
| 0:03:58| who is a representative of the current members of the class, James Carson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=238)|
| 0:04:09| and these individuals are to serve as class representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=249)|
| 0:04:13| I was here last time asking that this commission provide fees for these persons to fully and adequately represent the class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=253)|
| 0:04:23| Since then there has been, or even before then, there has been considerable urging from all aspects of Knox County government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=263)|
| 0:04:33| and when I say all aspects of Knox County government, I want to include you as current commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=273)|
| 0:04:40| You have spoken with various people, and me in some instances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=280)|
| 0:04:45| as well as your current commissioners who were very instrumental with the retirement board on the outrageous cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=285)|
| 0:04:54| that this litigation is costing the taxpayers of Knox County, Tennessee, to sue their own employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=294)|
| 0:05:02| And, of course, when I was here before, I was in the unenviable position of saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=302)|
| 0:05:08| hey, wait a minute, pay for attorneys for these unrepresentative employees, which only increased the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=308)|
| 0:05:17| Now, let me tell you about the growing bill and the urgency, if I can give you some suggestions as to how to handle this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=317)|
| 0:05:27| to resolve this matter tonight, tomorrow, or Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=327)|
| 0:05:34| And that is there's a truism in my practice of law, and that is that often that hours are there to be billed will be filled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=334)|
| 0:05:45| In other words, the billing process is ongoing as we speak here with regard to the now nine attorneys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=345)|
| 0:05:54| that are being paid by Knox County to participate in this fiasco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=354)|
| 0:06:00| Now, with regard to those nine attorneys, though, the urgency of getting this matter settled is that we are approaching a trial date of November the 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=360)|
| 0:06:10| As we approach that trial date on November 12th, the little mouse in the wheel runs a lot faster, works a lot harder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=370)|
| 0:06:20| and is working much harder to get the cheese.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=380)|
| 0:06:24| And those bills are going to go astronomical once the trial preparation begins for a trial on November the 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=384)|
| 0:06:34| So it is for that reason that I stand before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=394)|
| 0:06:38| And first of all, I applaud the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=398)|
| 0:06:41| I mean, you all know I've been in litigation with Knox County and Knox County officials for over 40 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=401)|
| 0:06:49| and I was never as proud as I was to see a Knox County official stand up and say, enough is enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=409)|
| 0:06:59| Because enough was enough $600,000 ago, and it is only going to get astronomically worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=419)|
| 0:07:09| This is a workshop, and I understand at a workshop this body cannot vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=429)|
| 0:07:16| However, we have a hearing, what's known as the fairness hearing, before Chancellor Weaver on October the 17th at 930.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=436)|
| 0:07:28| When I was here before, there was talk of having a special emergency call meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=448)|
| 0:07:34| I'm aware that your rules require 48 hours to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=454)|
| 0:07:40| First of all, I urge you to put on an agenda tonight in a workshop matter this matter to be heard in an emergency session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=460)|
| 0:07:52| Thank you, Mr. Monsier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=472)|
| 0:07:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=473)|
| 0:07:54| That was your five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=474)|
| 0:07:57| Okay, next we have Al Holifield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=477)|
| 0:08:02| Al Holifield, one of those attorneys that you just heard about, 11907 Kingston Pike, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=482)|
| 0:08:10| And just to finish up what he's saying, there's a hearing Wednesday morning at 930 about the fairness of this settlement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=490)|
| 0:08:18| And what we're asking this body to do is to send a clear message to help end this needless litigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=498)|
| 0:08:26| is to take an emergency action to approve this settlement and agree with the mayor to cut this off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=506)|
| 0:08:35| And for the reasons that the mayor articulated in his press release,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=515)|
| 0:08:41| none of the uniformed officers signed up asked to be members of a class to be sued for simply signing a form to obtain a pension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=521)|
| 0:08:51| that was promised them by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=531)|
| 0:08:55| And no one promised a desire to be drug into this litigation, forced to hire attorneys in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=535)|
| 0:09:03| And we're asking this body to support the efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=543)|
| 0:09:07| And I know that some of the commissioners here are on the Knox County Pension Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=547)|
| 0:09:10| and voted to approve the settlement from that perspective, and we're hoping that the rest would join in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=550)|
| 0:09:16| And I guess I'm here to answer your questions, if there's any questions from the county commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=556)|
| 0:09:31| Not all at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=571)|
| 0:09:35| Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=575)|
| 0:09:37| Yes, Mr. Holyfield, Mr. Monsier, I think you guys are aware that we have placed on our agenda an item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=577)|
| 0:09:42| that obviously won't be officially voted on tonight because it was just added to the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=582)|
| 0:09:47| and it's a form of the same discussion that the mayor's had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=587)|
| 0:09:53| But I'll tell you that next Monday, I mean, I'm the sponsor of the item, of the settlement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=593)|
| 0:10:00| I will be voting in the affirmative and I will write a letter if you need to, to take to the court of my vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=600)|
| 0:10:05| But it's not an official vote and it's an affirmation for you that you might need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=605)|
| 0:10:09| and I'll be happy to write that letter to the court of my affirmation of that resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=609)|
| 0:10:13| I would love six or more of those letters if they're willing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=613)|
| 0:10:17| I can tell you I'll write you one or have the office write you one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=617)|
| 0:10:21| I will be happy to send you my address to send that letter to or email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=621)|
| 0:10:27| We personally can pick them up, according to Mr. Monsier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=627)|
| 0:10:32| Any other questions out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=632)|
| 0:10:35| As Herb said, the trial is coming up November 12th, and that's when the serious clocks start ticking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=635)|
| 0:10:41| and the serious dollars get going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=641)|
| 0:10:43| We now have a class. It's been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=643)|
| 0:10:46| And we've got to adequately represent our clients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=646)|
| 0:10:50| and we've got to do our jobs within the ethical bounds of what we have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=650)|
| 0:10:55| And we're trying to, for the sake of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=655)|
| 0:10:57| this seems like a reasonable, prudent way to resolve this litigation for the sake of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=657)|
| 0:11:03| and that's what we're asking the county to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=663)|
| 0:11:09| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=669)|
| 0:11:12| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=672)|
| 0:11:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=673)|
| 0:11:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=674)|
| 0:11:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=675)|
| 0:11:17| Okay. The next person for public forum is Stephen Garrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=677)|
| 0:11:21| Mr. Garrett was in trial all day today and asked me to give the commission his regrets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=681)|
| 0:11:28| He will not be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=688)|
| 0:11:30| Okay. All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=690)|
| 0:11:31| However, all 635 former and past members of the UOP are all strongly in favor of this, including his client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=691)|
| 0:11:45| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=705)|
| 0:11:47| Let's see. The next person I have registered for public forum is James Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=707)|
| 0:12:00| Mr. Higgins, if you could say your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=720)|
| 0:12:02| And you've got five minutes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=722)|
| 0:12:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=723)|
| 0:12:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=724)|
| 0:12:05| James Higgins, 2334 Dare Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=725)|
| 0:12:11| I'm here to, I guess, give my opinion on the recent enforcement of county rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=731)|
| 0:12:22| and regulations towards football coaches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=742)|
| 0:12:29| And I would like to, I've got a statement prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=749)|
| 0:12:32| The current recommendation criteria for exclusion for parks and recreation that is currently being implemented by county parks and rec,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=752)|
| 0:12:41| it's unfair, unforgiving, and it denies the youth access to mentors from their own community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=761)|
| 0:12:49| This would be specifically speaking to inner city kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=769)|
| 0:12:53| And what we're getting at is they've got rules set in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=773)|
| 0:13:02| And from my understanding in the recent years, five, ten years, I'm not really sure, before the new county government came in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=782)|
| 0:13:11| they didn't really adhere to the guidelines that were on paper as far as speaking to coaches with felonies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=791)|
| 0:13:21| And the thing is, I believe it was on kind of a vetting system in previous years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=801)|
| 0:13:26| The head of parks and rec would go back to the commissioners after the background checks being done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=806)|
| 0:13:32| and they have discrepancies, you know, coaches have discrepancies on their background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=812)|
| 0:13:37| I believe it was just a vetting process, you know, more of a, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=817)|
| 0:13:42| somebody just recommending you to the county parks and rec, or even an appeal process to get you sat down in front of the higher ups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=822)|
| 0:13:51| But I feel like it's punishing people beyond the judicial system, because once you do get convicted of a crime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=831)|
| 0:13:59| you have to go serve, you know, prison time, or it may not be probation or parole or what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=839)|
| 0:14:06| And I feel like, you know, denying access to bring up the youth from your own community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=846)|
| 0:14:11| years and years after the trouble you were in, I feel like it's punishing us extra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=851)|
| 0:14:21| And it's affecting youth outreach and the ability to maintain a role as a productive member of society,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=861)|
| 0:14:29| which would be, you know, when you do finish your sentence, your parole, your probation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=869)|
| 0:14:37| the whole premise of corrections is to rehabilitate people and put them back into society,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=877)|
| 0:14:47| to be upstanding community members and possibly give back to the community, become, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=887)|
| 0:14:53| taxpayers, work jobs, you know, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=893)|
| 0:14:56| And I feel like we're denying our youth mentors, we're denying the kids, our youth mentors from their own community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=896)|
| 0:15:07| people who can reach them, who know the struggle that they face every single day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=907)|
| 0:15:12| And it can show them a better way and lead them a better way than maybe, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=912)|
| 0:15:18| make different choices than they made, the coaches made in their life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=918)|
| 0:15:22| And in conclusion, I just want to ask that the guidelines be looked at and be revisited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=922)|
| 0:15:29| and maybe we could get those reconstructed or at least put in an appeals process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=929)|
| 0:15:36| for the people that do not fall into the guidelines that allow you to coach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=936)|
| 0:15:43| That's all I have. I'm open for questions as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=943)|
| 0:15:47| Hey, you're open for questions. I see Commissioner Biggs' light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=947)|
| 0:15:52| Mr. Higgins, thanks for coming down. I've got a question. What team are you associated with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=952)|
| 0:15:56| I am associated with the 10-year-old Knoxville Falcons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=956)|
| 0:15:59| Okay. How many kids are on that team?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=959)|
| 0:16:02| Twenty-seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=962)|
| 0:16:04| Whenever you assume the position of coach, how long have you been doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=964)|
| 0:16:09| I have coached since 2016 in the baseball season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=969)|
| 0:16:14| This will be my third football season. I've coached three previous baseball seasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=974)|
| 0:16:19| Okay. So when the previous administration let you coach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=979)|
| 0:16:22| did you have to pass a background check to be able to coach?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=982)|
| 0:16:27| I had to submit a background check. I believe it was $16 every two years, or it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=987)|
| 0:16:32| I had to submit one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=992)|
| 0:16:34| And from my understanding, you know, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=994)|
| 0:16:37| if there was any discrepancies that, you know, put you out of the guidelines to coach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=997)|
| 0:16:42| the last administration at Parks and Rec would go to the commissioner and kind of get a vouch for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1002)|
| 0:16:47| And if need be, set up a meeting with you and kind of put a face with the name instead of just, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1007)|
| 0:16:53| just seeing the charge on paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| Do you by any chance know of how many coaches this has affected across Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1016)|
| 0:17:02| I believe the last I've heard it was 15 coaches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1022)|
| 0:17:07| Is it only football?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1027)|
| 0:17:11| I cannot answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1031)|
| 0:17:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| Okay. Thank you. Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| No, thank you. Not at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1038)|
| 0:17:22| All right. Thank you, Mr. Sims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1042)|
| 0:17:26| Okay. So that's James Higgins, Ronnie Sims. That was Ronnie Sims, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1046)|
| 0:17:38| Okay. So that was James Higgins. So Ronnie Sims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1058)|
| 0:17:41| Ronnie, are you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1061)|
| 0:17:48| Okay. Ronnie had registered to speak about the coaching situation as well, but I don't believe he is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1068)|
| 0:17:57| Is there anyone else who would want to address Commissioner at part of public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1077)|
| 0:18:06| Sir, would you mind coming down to the podium, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| Is that Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1089)|
| 0:18:11| Chris, I've got a note from you regarding the jail contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1091)|
| 0:18:18| The note indicated that you wanted to speak when that item is heard by a commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1098)|
| 0:18:23| Would you like to speak about that right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1103)|
| 0:18:25| or would it be more preferential for you to speak about it when we're actually hearing that particular item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1105)|
| 0:18:29| I should probably do it now before all the caffeine completely wears off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1109)|
| 0:18:34| So, yeah, if I might now, that would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1114)|
| 0:18:36| Okay. All right. You've got five minutes. Please state your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1116)|
| 0:18:40| My name is Chris Irwin. My address is 2131 Riverside Drive, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1120)|
| 0:18:46| According to my Uncle Buford, my family's been here for five generations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1126)|
| 0:18:50| He sold used cars, so I take that with a grain of salt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1130)|
| 0:18:54| I came in towards the end where we were talking about the jail population, and I had questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1134)|
| 0:18:59| I guess one question is why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1139)|
| 0:19:02| Why is our jail population going up when the Department of Justice statistics and FBI statistics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1142)|
| 0:19:07| clearly show for the last few years crime has gone down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1147)|
| 0:19:11| Why is it that 85 percent of the people that are incarcerated who are presumed innocent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1151)|
| 0:19:17| – let's dwell on those two words, presumed innocent –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1157)|
| 0:19:21| can't make the rich man's bonds that are placed on them to get out, many nonviolent offenders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1161)|
| 0:19:28| Why is it that suddenly there's a staffing problem, and we were told that ending in-person visitation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1168)|
| 0:19:34| oh, that's going to free up some staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1174)|
| 0:19:37| Apparently that didn't work out as planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1177)|
| 0:19:40| I guess in all this picture, what bothers me the most is what I've seen is basically a de facto caste system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1180)|
| 0:19:45| that's evolved in the jail, which we're all stewards of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1185)|
| 0:19:49| I'm a taxpayer. I'm a steward of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| And what I see is you can get out of jail if you can afford the rich man's bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1191)|
| 0:19:56| You've got the low-calorie diet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1196)|
| 0:19:58| I was with a client yesterday who lost 100 pounds so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1198)|
| 0:20:01| You know, you lose weight in the jail unless you can afford the commissary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1201)|
| 0:20:06| In-person visitation has been ended despite 200 years of studies showing by every measurable metric| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1206)|
| 0:20:13| it helps recidivism, in-person visitation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1213)|
| 0:20:17| while there's almost no study showing that ending it for this questionable pay-per-view of your family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1217)|
| 0:20:23| So what have we done for visitation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1223)|
| 0:20:25| You can see your family all you want if you can pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1225)|
| 0:20:31| Every aspect of the jail we've commodified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1231)|
| 0:20:34| We have turned citizens into essentially cattle for profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1234)|
| 0:20:38| And as a taxpayer, I take, you know, that's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1238)|
| 0:20:42| You can afford food if you can pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1242)|
| 0:20:44| You can see your family if you can pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1244)|
| 0:20:46| You can get out of jail if you can pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1246)|
| 0:20:49| And meanwhile, we're cramming the jail forward and nobody asks the question, like, why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1249)|
| 0:20:55| Why do we have 287G people from other counties now that are occupying our jail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1255)|
| 0:21:00| Why is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1260)|
| 0:21:02| You know, these questions that, you know, should be asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1262)|
| 0:21:05| Why is so many people just can't afford these bonds that we've put on them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1265)|
| 0:21:11| Why has every aspect of our jail become about making money from citizens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1271)|
| 0:21:16| I'm in that jail pretty much two, three times a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1276)|
| 0:21:19| We have pregnant women sleeping on floors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1279)|
| 0:21:23| Four months pregnant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1283)|
| 0:21:25| Think about that, ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1285)|
| 0:21:28| Think about, you know, our caste system we've created in jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1288)|
| 0:21:31| You get better food, better visitation, better communication, and a better likelihood of getting out if you have money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1291)|
| 0:21:38| And I would submit to you in a democracy, that's unbefitting of free people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1298)|
| 0:21:43| Citizens are not cattle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1303)|
| 0:21:45| We should not be profiting from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1305)|
| 0:21:47| And we shouldn't be cramming our jails at a time where if we've learned anything in the last few decades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1307)|
| 0:21:52| it's if putting people in prison for drugs worked, we'd be the most drug-free society in the history of this planet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1312)|
| 0:21:59| Instead, it's the opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1319)|
| 0:22:01| Prohibition fails miserably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1321)|
| 0:22:03| In Switzerland right now, the OD rates are going down because they treated it as a health problem rather than a criminal problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1323)|
| 0:22:12| We need to ask these questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1332)|
| 0:22:14| Where is the money going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1334)|
| 0:22:15| Why are we commodifying our jails?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| What happened with these savings we were going to have with our personnel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1337)|
| 0:22:21| These are really simple questions, and I was just, I didn't hear them, and I was like, why isn't anyone asking this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1341)|
| 0:22:27| Why are they, where are these people coming from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1347)|
| 0:22:29| Why can't they make the bond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1349)|
| 0:22:31| So I invite you as public servants and myself as a citizen of Knox County to begin asking these questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1351)|
| 0:22:37| Because it's not magic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1357)|
| 0:22:39| You know, the Department of Justice statistics, I was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1359)|
| 0:22:41| it took me 30 seconds on my cell phone to see where crime rates have been going in this state and in this country for the last few years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1361)|
| 0:22:48| and it's been down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| So we've got to find out something because the current status quo is not working,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1370)|
| 0:22:54| and I would suggest in a democracy, it's a little disgraceful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1374)|
| 0:22:59| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1379)|
| 0:23:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1381)|
| 0:23:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1382)|
| 0:23:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1384)|
| 0:23:05| Does that conclude?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1385)|
| 0:23:06| Is there anyone else in the audience that would like to address County Commission as part of public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1386)|
| 0:23:13| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| Yeah, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| We had Mickalia, Ms. Harrison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1396)|
| 0:23:21| She was not here at the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1401)|
| 0:23:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1404)|
| 0:23:25| Well, we will move on with our agenda, and before we move on to amending our agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1405)|
| 0:23:29| I'd like to recognize some of our elected officials who are joining us today at County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1409)|

| 0:24:25| which was related to line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1465)|

| 0:25:29| From the agenda or from consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1529)|
| 0:25:31| Oh, from the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1531)|
| 0:25:33| It hasn't been added yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1533)|

| 0:25:44| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1544)|
| 0:25:45| Is there any other changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1545)|
| 0:25:48| Okay, the chair will entertain a motion to defer these items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1548)|
| 0:25:58| I make a motion to defer items 35, 36, and the line item transfer that refers to the BMX to next month's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1558)|

| 0:26:09| Was that a second by Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1569)|
| 0:26:11| Okay, this motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1571)|

| 0:26:36| upon the occasion of its receipt of the 2018 Veteran Owned Business Achievement Award by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1596)|
| 0:26:44| I'll entertain a motion to add that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1604)|
| 0:26:47| All right, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1607)|
| 0:26:49| You can do them individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1609)|
| 0:26:50| I'm going to do them individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1610)|

| 0:27:13| Motion to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1633)|
| 0:27:17| Okay, a motion to add has been made by Commissioner Anders and a second has been made by Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1637)|
| 0:27:24| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1644)|
| 0:27:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| All right, it passes and has been added to our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1647)|
| 0:27:31| Okay, the next item is item 39.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1651)|
| 0:27:35| This was the aforementioned resolution regarding the acceptance of the mayor's, to read it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1655)|
| 0:27:43| it's a consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1663)|
| 0:27:48| approving the settlement proposal approved by the Knox County Retirement and Pension Board on September 24th, 2018,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1668)|
| 0:27:55| and to be accepted by the county mayor on October 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1675)|
| 0:27:59| We are voting not to vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1679)|
| 0:28:03| This vote would be to add this to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1683)|
| 0:28:08| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1688)|
| 0:28:09| Okay, the motion to add has been made by Commissioner Anders and a second has been made by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1689)|
| 0:28:19| Any discussion? Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1699)|
| 0:28:23| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1703)|
| 0:28:27| Just reading from the caption, this is approving a settlement by commission of an arrangement agreed to by the mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1707)|
| 0:28:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1724)|
| 0:28:49| Is this in proper form then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1729)|
| 0:28:52| Because is the resolution written by the law department concerning the contract or is this a, where is this coming from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1732)|
| 0:29:04| Who has prepared the verbiage that we're taking to be legal here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1744)|
| 0:29:11| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1751)|
| 0:29:12| As stated on the agenda item, Mr. Owings prepared the agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1752)|
| 0:29:18| I put my name as a sponsor, and the law director's office doesn't have to write a resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1758)|
| 0:29:25| especially a resolution in which they're in conflict on the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1765)|
| 0:29:29| Can I call a point of order?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1769)|
| 0:29:32| This is just to add. This is not to discuss the item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1772)|
| 0:29:37| I need to know whether I'm in favor of adding or not, so we have discussion on the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1777)|
| 0:29:42| Yeah, I think some discussion is appropriate for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1782)|
| 0:29:46| As Commissioner Anders added, it was prepared by John Owings, who is the legal counsel for the Knox County Pension Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1786)|
| 0:29:55| and Commissioner Anders submitted it to be added with sponsors Jay and Smith to be added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1795)|
| 0:30:04| Can I ask another point of order, just what I was making here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1804)|
| 0:30:07| This is to be added, and we're discussing an item that's not on the agenda properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1807)|
| 0:30:13| Can we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| The proper way would just be to have a vote to add this and then have the discussion at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1815)|
| 0:30:21| I believe there can be discussion any time the motion's on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1821)|
| 0:30:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1825)|
| 0:30:29| Okay. Is there any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1829)|
| 0:30:32| So the position that I'm looking at then is that we, commission, are being asked to approve a contract between Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1832)|
| 0:30:43| and a group that has not been reviewed by the law department of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1843)|
| 0:30:51| and if that's true, I will not be in favor of this ad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1851)|
| 0:30:55| Thank you. Is there any other discussion for this ad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1855)|
| 0:31:02| Okay. All right. I'll do a vote. All in favor of this, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1862)|
| 0:31:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1867)|
| 0:31:08| All opposed, say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1870)|
| 0:31:11| Okay. We'll have a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1871)|
| 0:31:16| You can tell me where we start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1876)|
| 0:31:18| We'll start with Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1878)|
| 0:31:22| On a roll call vote, go ahead, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1882)|
| 0:31:25| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1885)|

| 0:32:45| Two-thirds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1965)|
| 0:32:46| Two-thirds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1966)|
| 0:32:47| So it would take eight votes to add to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1967)|
| 0:32:50| Go ahead and announce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1970)|
| 0:32:53| Go ahead and announce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1973)|
| 0:32:56| We had six ayes and four noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1976)|
| 0:33:00| Okay, so that does not pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1980)|
| 0:33:02| That's two-thirds of the body or is that two-thirds of the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1982)|
| 0:33:05| Two-thirds of the membership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1985)|
| 0:33:06| Membership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1986)|
| 0:33:07| Membership present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1987)|
| 0:33:11| Membership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1995)|
| 0:33:16| I really just want to take a moment of privilege to make a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=1996)|
| 0:33:21| This wasn't voting on an item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| This is a serious matter before this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2003)|
| 0:33:27| And this commission just voted to continue to pay up to a million dollars to sue themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2007)|
| 0:33:39| with an opportunity to settle this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2019)|
| 0:33:43| And I'm ashamed that we would even bring this up for a vote to represent the employees of this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2023)|
| 0:33:50| That is disrespectful and unnecessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2030)|
| 0:33:54| And I don't take votes personal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2034)|
| 0:33:56| And at the end of this day, it will be over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| But this is embarrassing for this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| And I'm disappointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2040)|
| 0:34:05| Commissioner Bessler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2045)|
| 0:34:07| I'll also take a point of privilege right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2047)|
| 0:34:11| A few weeks back, we voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2051)|
| 0:34:14| And I made a statement that this should be settled in the court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2054)|
| 0:34:18| because they wanted to have it settled in the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2058)|
| 0:34:21| And it floundered around, and everybody voted, and it never passed thin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2061)|
| 0:34:28| Now, this commission has been litigated to by the court tell us how we're to act and what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2068)|
| 0:34:38| This settlement, I don't see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| I don't know what we're voting for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2080)|
| 0:34:42| And I don't know if it's going to settle the issue and if this issue will rise again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2082)|
| 0:34:47| I do not know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2087)|
| 0:34:49| But I do know when I read the litigation that Chancellor Weaver said he was taking no more motions, nothing else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2089)|
| 0:34:56| and this would be decided at that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2096)|
| 0:35:01| So it will be decided, and we will be told how our pension plan works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2101)|
| 0:35:07| We have two sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2107)|
| 0:35:09| One says it works this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2109)|
| 0:35:11| One says it works the other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2111)|
| 0:35:12| I don't know, but the court needs to tell us how this pension plan works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2112)|
| 0:35:18| And until we get that decision, we're going to have this back and forth between both bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2118)|
| 0:35:24| And we each, under our charter form of government here, have certain lanes we stay in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2124)|
| 0:35:32| And I think that we're getting out of our lanes right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2132)|
| 0:35:37| And we're going to violate our oath of office by doing what we were asked to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2137)|
| 0:35:44| And I'm not going to violate that oath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2144)|
| 0:35:48| So if you want to violate your oath, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2148)|
| 0:35:53| But look what the charter says we are to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2153)|
| 0:35:56| And that's all I'm asking this body to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2156)|
| 0:36:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2160)|
| 0:36:03| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2163)|
| 0:36:05| This resolution was doing nothing more than approving, not approving the plan or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2165)|
| 0:36:12| just approving the support of a settlement-reached agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2172)|
| 0:36:16| That's all it was doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| And I think the citizens and the taxpayers and everyone needed an opportunity for this to get vetted in front of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2178)|
| 0:36:29| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2189)|
| 0:36:31| I'm sorry, I turned over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2191)|
| 0:36:33| Larson, did you have your light on before Carson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2193)|
| 0:36:36| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2196)|
| 0:36:39| I stood right out here and I raised my right hand to support the Constitution of the United States,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2199)|
| 0:36:47| the state of Tennessee, and the charter of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| There is a right way to do this and a wrong way to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2209)|
| 0:36:52| This is the wrong way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2212)|
| 0:36:53| The right way is if you want it 75 and 43 days, put it on the—bring a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2213)|
| 0:36:59| We'll put it on the next 2020 calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| Let the citizens vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2222)|
| 0:37:03| That's the correct way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2223)|
| 0:37:05| Trying to go behind—I'm tired of being thrown under the bus to protect the charter of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2225)|
| 0:37:13| We're talking about the charter of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2233)|
| 0:37:17| and I will support the charter until the day I die, until the day I am no longer in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2237)|
| 0:37:24| I will not support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2244)|
| 0:37:26| If you want to write a letter, Brad suggested write a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| Write a letter and you sign it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2248)|
| 0:37:30| But I am not going to destroy the charter of Knox County when I stood right there and raised my right hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2250)|
| 0:37:37| No way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2257)|
| 0:37:40| Thank you. Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2260)|
| 0:37:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2262)|
| 0:37:43| I think this body missed the purpose of where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2263)|
| 0:37:50| This motion was to simply add an agenda item to have a vote next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2270)|
| 0:37:55| with a discussion, with a public vetting process, which everybody could come and give their opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2275)|
| 0:38:00| And I think this body took an opportunity to basically vote on it ahead of the game| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2280)|
| 0:38:05| and not go through the process of what I think is good public transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2285)|
| 0:38:10| And I think it's a shame to not go through a process in which we can invite everybody to the table to have a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2290)|
| 0:38:17| Basically voted and never have a discussion about it further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2297)|
| 0:38:20| That's what this body did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2300)|
| 0:38:22| I think it's a sad state when we can't even put things before us and have a conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2302)|
| 0:38:27| and then make a vote on it to just shut it down ahead of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2307)|
| 0:38:30| So I think this body missed a boat and missed an opportunity to have a further conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2310)|
| 0:38:35| And unfortunately, it's now going to result in a whole lot more confusion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2315)|
| 0:38:39| a whole lot more money, and a whole lot more angst amongst a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2319)|
| 0:38:45| We have a pension board, pension retire board, which I'm a member of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2325)|
| 0:38:50| We have an elected mayor, we have an elected county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2330)|
| 0:38:52| and we have an elected team of people who are trying to find a way forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2332)|
| 0:38:57| But to not even have a discussion I think is a little sad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2337)|
| 0:39:01| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2341)|
| 0:39:02| Is there any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2342)|
| 0:39:06| All right, moving on, our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2346)|
| 0:39:09| The next item on the agenda, sorry, that was a tough vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2349)|
| 0:39:16| And speaking just as kind of frankly taking my chair hat off for just a moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2356)|
| 0:39:23| that was a tough vote for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2363)|
| 0:39:26| And I want to echo, I guess, what Commissioner Anders said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2366)|
| 0:39:32| Once tonight is over, the votes are behind us, and we'll all come together to continue to work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2372)|
| 0:39:38| But that was a tough vote, and I don't really want to say anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2378)|
| 0:39:43| All right, that one does not approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2383)|
| 0:39:47| So we have now added items five and item 29 onto our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2387)|
| 0:39:54| We have deferred the items that were deferred, and we've got those registered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| We can now move on to the meat of our agenda and the items that have not been put on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2398)|
| 0:40:07| The first item for discussion is item number five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2407)|
| 0:40:14| This is consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2414)|
| 0:40:18| honoring Strata-G LLC upon the occasion of its receipt of the 2018 Veteran-Owned Business Achievement Award| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2418)|
| 0:40:25| by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| This is resolution 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2427)|
| 0:40:32| Okay, go ahead, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2432)|
| 0:40:34| Do you want me to go to the podium or just right here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2434)|
| 0:40:36| Go right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2436)|
| 0:40:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2437)|
| 0:40:38| So the reason I asked for this, Strata-G LLC is a 51 percent ran and owned veterans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2438)|
| 0:40:46| basically a business here in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| Thousands of people put in for this award, and they got it and actually went to Washington, D.C.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2448)|
| 0:40:55| and was awarded from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| and I would just like to take the opportunity to acknowledge them next week if we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2457)|
| 0:41:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2464)|
| 0:41:05| Would you like to make a specific motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2465)|
| 0:41:08| You could make a motion for no recommendation, and then we can approve it next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2468)|
| 0:41:11| Is that fine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2471)|
| 0:41:12| Yeah, I'd like to make a motion for no recommendation and approve it next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2472)|
| 0:41:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2475)|
| 0:41:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2476)|
| 0:41:17| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2477)|
| 0:41:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2478)|
| 0:41:19| So Commissioner Biggs has made the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2479)|
| 0:41:20| It was seconded by Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2484)|
| 0:41:25| All opposed, say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2489)|
| 0:41:30| The next item on our agenda is Item No. 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2490)|
| 0:41:34| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2494)|
| 0:41:35| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2495)|

| 0:47:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2864)|
| 0:47:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2865)|
| 0:47:46| Item 20, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2866)|
| 0:47:48| This is a resolution approving Amendment 3 to the Contracts with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2868)|
| 0:47:52| Securus Technologies, Inc., for the provision of an inmate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2872)|
| 0:47:55| communications and management system, which amendment provides for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2875)|
| 0:48:00| Securus to provide Knox County a one-time additional development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2880)|
| 0:48:03| payment of $250,000 and provide for commission percentage changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2883)|
| 0:48:08| This is Resolution 301.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2888)|
| 0:48:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2891)|
| 0:48:12| Is there a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2892)|
| 0:48:14| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2894)|
| 0:48:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2895)|
| 0:48:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2896)|
| 0:48:17| There's a motion to approve by Commissioner Wright and a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| by Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2899)|
| 0:48:20| Or did I flip that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2900)|
| 0:48:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2902)|
| 0:48:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2903)|
| 0:48:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2904)|
| 0:48:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2905)|
| 0:48:26| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2906)|
| 0:48:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2907)|
| 0:48:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2909)|
| 0:48:30| I just wanted to, now that I've forgotten my question, my mind is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2910)|
| 0:48:35| still racing on one of the last votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2915)|
| 0:48:40| The Securus, I don't know what it was, the gentleman, Mr. Chris,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2920)|
| 0:48:45| that came up, there are still on-site visitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2925)|
| 0:48:50| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| Someone can still come out there and sit there and talk to their loved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2932)|
| 0:48:55| ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2935)|
| 0:48:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2936)|
| 0:48:57| Because that is totally a misconception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2937)|
| 0:49:01| If you wanted to drive out to Maloneyville, you can do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2941)|
| 0:49:05| and you can sit there and converse face-to-face with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2945)|
| 0:49:08| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2948)|
| 0:49:09| You could never.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2949)|
| 0:49:18| Commissioner, they can come to the detention facility, not face-to-face,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2958)|
| 0:49:23| but they're able to get on the video visitation at no cost there at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2963)|
| 0:49:28| facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2968)|
| 0:49:29| That's what my next statement is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2969)|
| 0:49:30| I don't think there's ever been really a face-to-face meeting in a long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2970)|
| 0:49:35| time anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2975)|
| 0:49:36| Not since they went to the video visitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2978)|
| 0:49:39| I just wanted to clarify that so people will understand that, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2979)|
| 0:49:42| they still can go out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2982)|
| 0:49:44| Is there a time limit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2984)|
| 0:49:47| Is there a time limit for the video chat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2987)|
| 0:49:52| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2992)|
| 0:49:53| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2993)|
| 0:49:54| No, as long as they're paying for it, as far as if they're paying it from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2994)|
| 0:49:56| home, but if they go out there to the detention facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2996)|
| 0:49:59| they don't have to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| But how long is the time period that they can speak to the individual?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3001)|
| 0:50:04| As long as they're whatever they can afford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3004)|
| 0:50:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3007)|
| 0:50:10| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3010)|
| 0:50:12| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3012)|
| 0:50:14| In this contract amendment, there's some mention of some software| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3014)|
| 0:50:17| removal, and there's no mention of a replacement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3017)|
| 0:50:20| Were there problems with the software, or is this a company merger?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3020)|
| 0:50:24| The software was for a new and improved inmate management system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3024)|
| 0:50:30| which Securus did not deliver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3030)|
| 0:50:33| And that's why we're getting the $250,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3033)|
| 0:50:36| since they didn't deliver on that new inmate management system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3036)|
| 0:50:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3039)|
| 0:50:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3040)|
| 0:50:41| So, no, there's no software.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3041)|
| 0:50:43| So we could replace it with the money they're giving us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3043)|
| 0:50:48| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3048)|
| 0:50:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3050)|
| 0:50:51| We'll entertain a vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3051)|
| 0:50:52| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3052)|
| 0:50:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3054)|
| 0:50:55| All opposed, say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3055)|
| 0:50:57| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3057)|
| 0:51:00| Item 28.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3060)|
| 0:51:03| This is a resolution approving the CSXT four-party railroad agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3063)|
| 0:51:08| between the Tennessee Department of Transportation, CSXT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3068)|
| 0:51:12| the City of Knoxville, and Knox County for the replacement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3072)|
| 0:51:15| construction, and or widening and maintenance repairs thereof for bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3075)|
| 0:51:20| structure and approaches to carry topside road over the tracks of the CSXT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3080)|
| 0:51:25| railroad pursuant to Department of Transportation Project Number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3085)|
| 0:51:30| STP-NH-11527-47026-2281-14,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3090)|
| 0:51:42| better known as the Alcoa Highway Improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| for the Knox County line to North Maloney Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3104)|
| 0:51:48| This is Resolution 407.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3108)|
| 0:51:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3111)|
| 0:51:52| Do I have a motion for approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3112)|
| 0:51:54| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3114)|
| 0:51:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3115)|
| 0:51:56| It was moved by Commissioner Daley and seconded by Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3116)|
| 0:52:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3120)|
| 0:52:01| Is there any discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3121)|
| 0:52:03| Yes, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3123)|
| 0:52:05| Jim, I just brought one up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3125)|
| 0:52:07| This is the road that goes over to the dead end topside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3127)|
| 0:52:10| That's a wooden bridge, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3130)|
| 0:52:13| Jim Snowden, 205 West Backstreet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3133)|
| 0:52:15| No, Commissioner, it's actually a concrete span bridge there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3135)|
| 0:52:19| I'm trying to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| Do you know when it was replaced in the last few years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3141)|
| 0:52:25| I think it was replaced as part of the new bridge widening over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3145)|
| 0:52:30| right there at the county lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3150)|
| 0:52:32| It is in good condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3152)|
| 0:52:34| and the new bridge that's being constructed will be entirely in the city limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3154)|
| 0:52:40| and it will span both the railroad and Alcoa Highway to create for those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3160)|
| 0:52:44| dead end people that live at that section of topside to be able to access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3164)|
| 0:52:49| Alcoa Highway without making a left-hand turn against traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3169)|
| 0:52:52| Yeah, since you said that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3172)|
| 0:52:53| I do remember when they did widen the road there at the line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3173)|
| 0:52:56| that that's when the bridge was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3176)|
| 0:52:58| It was a wooden bridge at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3178)|
| 0:53:00| That's before my time, but yes, sir, it may have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3180)|
| 0:53:03| Thank you, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3183)|
| 0:53:04| Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3184)|
| 0:53:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3186)|
| 0:53:07| What is going to be the cost of this for Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3187)|
| 0:53:10| There is no cost for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3190)|
| 0:53:12| It's part of the TDOT?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3192)|
| 0:53:14| Actually, the new structure will actually be contained entirely within the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3194)|
| 0:53:18| They've annexed out the right of way of Alcoa Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3198)|
| 0:53:20| so any future maintenance costs will actually be incurred by the city also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3200)|
| 0:53:25| The only reason this agreement is on here is one abutment of the bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3205)|
| 0:53:28| is contained within our jurisdiction currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3208)|
| 0:53:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3211)|
| 0:53:32| And the only thing I noticed on the contract on page 9| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3212)|
| 0:53:35| is we'll have to amend it to show who our new Knox County mayor is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3215)|
| 0:53:39| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3219)|
| 0:53:40| I noticed that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3220)|
| 0:53:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3222)|
| 0:53:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3223)|
| 0:53:44| Jim, I've got a quick question for you related to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3224)|
| 0:53:47| The TDOT funding, is this one of our first gas tax projects?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3227)|
| 0:53:52| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3232)|
| 0:53:53| This section, as well as the Cherokee Trail interchange, both are Improved Act funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3233)|
| 0:54:00| and both of these are scheduled to be let calendar year 19 of next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3240)|
| 0:54:04| Recently, I think you were there, we had a meeting with TDOT out at the Board of Realtors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3244)|
| 0:54:10| and heard from a lot of folks about a lot of this first wave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3250)|
| 0:54:14| and I guess for the general public who may be watching this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| a lot of those Improved Act funds for this first wave of funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3257)|
| 0:54:21| are all being designated for bridge repairs and bridge improvements just like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3261)|
| 0:54:27| Are you going to be bringing us any more projects here in the near future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3267)|
| 0:54:31| as some of these Improved Act funds get deployed into our community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3271)|
| 0:54:35| What's your forecast?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3275)|
| 0:54:37| Yeah, and we can get you a list of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3277)|
| 0:54:40| I know TDOT has the widening of I-75 north of Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3280)|
| 0:54:47| That section from Emory Road to Raccoon Valley is two-lane, both directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3287)|
| 0:54:52| As part of the Improved Act, that's going to be widened to three lanes, both directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3292)|
| 0:54:56| And there's a couple more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3296)|
| 0:54:58| We actually did not have any Knox County-owned bridges that were in the Improved Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3298)|
| 0:55:03| All our bridges are in good or fair condition, so we weren't eligible for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3303)|
| 0:55:08| That's a good problem to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3308)|
| 0:55:09| That is a good problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3309)|
| 0:55:10| But, yeah, I can get you all a list of all the inclusive projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3310)|
| 0:55:13| but that's just a couple of the major ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3313)|
| 0:55:16| Okay, very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3316)|
| 0:55:18| Is there any other discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3318)|
| 0:55:20| Okay, I'll entertain a motion for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3322)|
| 0:55:23| Moved by Commissioner Buster, seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3323)|
| 0:55:26| We've already got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3326)|
| 0:55:27| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3327)|
| 0:55:28| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3328)|
| 0:55:29| That last vote kind of threw me off too, Carson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3329)|
| 0:55:32| Okay, all in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3332)|
| 0:55:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3334)|
| 0:55:35| All opposed, say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3335)|
| 0:55:37| Okay, it passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3337)|
| 0:55:38| Okay, next item is item number 30, which was pulled off the consent agenda by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3338)|
| 0:55:46| I'll entertain 29.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3346)|
| 0:55:54| Okay, item 29, which now is to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3354)|
| 0:55:59| Go ahead, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3359)|
| 0:56:09| I believe item 29, the intent of that when we added it was to put it on the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3369)|
| 0:56:17| So we need to go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3377)|
| 0:56:18| Item 29, go ahead, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3378)|
| 0:56:22| This is a resolution approving an amendment to Knox County contract number 16-533 with PSC Metals, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3382)|
| 0:56:29| to provide scrap metal services with an amendment that removes the consumer price index increase cap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3389)|
| 0:56:38| due to influctuating market prices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3398)|
| 0:56:41| This is resolution 409.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3401)|
| 0:56:45| Okay, do we have a motion for approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3405)|
| 0:56:47| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3407)|
| 0:56:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3408)|
| 0:56:49| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3409)|
| 0:56:50| All right, that was moved by Commissioner Smith and seconded by Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3410)|
| 0:56:54| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3414)|
| 0:56:56| Carson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3416)|
| 0:56:57| Are we talking about 29 or 30?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3419)|
| 0:57:00| Because we read 30, but I think we said 29, but it is 30, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3420)|
| 0:57:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3424)|
| 0:57:06| All right, this should clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3426)|
| 0:57:09| When I first brought up the agenda, I said item 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3429)|
| 0:57:12| And then someone on this body said we actually needed to do 29, so I believe you read 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3432)|
| 0:57:19| So that is correct, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3439)|
| 0:57:23| We had pulled item 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3443)|
| 0:57:26| We had added item 29 tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3446)|
| 0:57:30| 30 was pulled by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3450)|
| 0:57:36| So we can go back to 29 to approve that one tonight, right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3456)|
| 0:57:44| Then we will go to item 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| I will withdraw my motion and the second needs to withdraw his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3466)|
| 0:57:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3470)|
| 0:57:51| Go ahead, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3471)|
| 0:57:52| So we are doing away with the motion that is on the floor right now, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3472)|
| 0:57:56| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3476)|
| 0:57:57| That has been withdrawn by Commissioner Smith and we will move on to item 29.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3477)|
| 0:58:01| I think we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3481)|
| 0:58:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3484)|
| 0:58:05| I think the second has to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3485)|
| 0:58:07| This is a resolution approving the necessity right-of-way in drainage and construction easement acquisitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3487)|
| 0:58:14| on Track 6 of the property of Alice May Knisley, Cecil A. Knisley, Jr., and L.C. Knisley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3494)|

| 0:58:27| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3507)|
| 0:58:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3508)|
| 0:58:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3509)|
| 0:58:30| Move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3510)|
| 0:58:31| Motion was made by Commissioner Wright, seconded by Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3511)|
| 0:58:33| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3513)|
| 0:58:38| You've got your light on, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3518)|
| 0:58:40| Is that for this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| It's an early Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3522)|
| 0:58:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3524)|
| 0:58:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3527)|
| 0:58:48| Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3528)|
| 0:58:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3531)|
| 0:58:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3532)|
| 0:58:53| Any insight you'd like to have for this one, Friday, 29?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3533)|
| 0:58:56| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3536)|
| 0:58:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3537)|
| 0:58:58| In regard to the expansion of the Midway Business Park out there, there is one tract of land that we're going to have to acquire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3538)|
| 0:59:06| out there for those improvements in reference to Track 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3546)|
| 0:59:11| It's a small acquisition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3551)|
| 0:59:12| I think it's like 129 square feet, and it does have some temporary and permanent easements on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3552)|
| 0:59:17| This is for the road improvements necessary at the intersection of Thorn Grove Park and Midway Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3557)|
| 0:59:23| The property in question is located in the northeast corner of that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3563)|
| 0:59:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3567)|
| 0:59:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3568)|
| 0:59:29| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3569)|
| 0:59:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3570)|
| 0:59:31| This motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3571)|
| 0:59:32| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3572)|
| 0:59:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3574)|
| 0:59:35| All opposed, say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3575)|
| 0:59:36| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3576)|
| 0:59:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3577)|
| 0:59:39| Back to item number 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3579)|
| 0:59:40| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3580)|
| 0:59:43| This is a resolution approving an amendment to Knox County contract number 16-533 with PSC Metals, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3583)|
| 0:59:50| to provide scrap metal services, which amendment removes the consumer price index increase cap due to fluctuating market prices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3590)|
| 0:59:58| This is resolution 409.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3598)|
| 1:00:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3602)|
| 1:00:03| Is there a motion for approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3603)|
| 1:00:04| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3604)|
| 1:00:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3605)|
| 1:00:06| The initial motion came in from Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3606)|
| 1:00:08| The second motion to approve actually came in from Commissioner Smith, so I'll grant that as a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3608)|
| 1:00:15| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3615)|
| 1:00:18| Commissioner Smith, your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3618)|
| 1:00:20| Let Commissioner Daley go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3620)|
| 1:00:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3621)|
| 1:00:22| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3622)|
| 1:00:23| Thank you, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| Jim, is it true that PSC Metals will take refrigerators?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3625)|
| 1:00:30| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3630)|
| 1:00:31| Let me ask Drew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3631)|
| 1:00:32| Drew will know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3632)|
| 1:00:33| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| I'm Drew Thurman, 205 West Baxter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3635)|
| 1:00:38| So the answer on refrigerators is yes, PSC Metals does accept refrigerators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3638)|
| 1:00:44| We direct – because Knox County convenience centers do not accept refrigerators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3644)|
| 1:00:48| We refer a lot of folks that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3648)|
| 1:00:51| There's some – there's a process that they have to do to take the Freon out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3651)|
| 1:00:56| It's a proper evacuation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3656)|
| 1:00:59| At least as of now, you know, for the foreseeable future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3659)|
| 1:01:03| they have to hook up a refrigerator to evacuate that refrigerant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3663)|
| 1:01:08| Once that's done, they can legally shred it up and turn it back into scrap metal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3668)|
| 1:01:14| So it's basically to avoid the release of that Freon or other refrigerants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3674)|
| 1:01:20| So there's absolutely no reason for me to see a refrigerator dumped on the side of the road anymore, are there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3680)|
| 1:01:25| Well, I would say there's no excuse ever for you to see anything on the side of the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3685)|
| 1:01:29| that doesn't belong on the side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3689)|
| 1:01:31| But, yeah, I mean, it's a hassle for some folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3691)|
| 1:01:35| You know, they might come to a convenience center thinking we – they saw, you know, appliances there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3695)|
| 1:01:40| and they might think, oh, I'll bring my refrigerator, and they get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3700)|
| 1:01:43| And we do inform them that we don't accept them, and we give them a couple options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3703)|
| 1:01:49| either direct them directly to PSC where they actually have a chance to get paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3709)|
| 1:01:52| because they do – they charge you a little bit for that evacuation, but they also buy the scrap metal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3712)|
| 1:01:57| So – or you could take it to the city and county's joint facility at HHW in the downtown off of Baxter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3717)|
| 1:02:04| but there is a fee there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| It's like a $5 processing fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3726)|
| 1:02:08| And, again, that covers that evacuation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3728)|
| 1:02:10| Even the city and county's place, we have to have someone that is trained to identify which refrigerant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3730)|
| 1:02:17| and to, you know, suck it out and put it, you know, contain it into a containment cylinder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3737)|
| 1:02:23| And so that's a $5 handling fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3743)|
| 1:02:26| So there are folks that get frustrated when they come to a convenience center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3746)|
| 1:02:30| and may choose to disregard the law and decency and norms of society and litter or dump, and that's on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3750)|
| 1:02:41| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3761)|
| 1:02:43| Thank you, George.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3763)|
| 1:02:44| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3764)|
| 1:02:45| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3765)|
| 1:02:46| I'll call on Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3766)|
| 1:02:47| Follow on Commissioner Smith, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3767)|
| 1:02:51| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3771)|
| 1:02:55| I pulled this off because of – I guess we've tied this to the CPI in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3775)|
| 1:03:02| We have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3782)|
| 1:03:03| Most of our contracts with procurement we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3783)|
| 1:03:06| However, most of these metal contracts now with the new tariffs, our signpost bid we're having to –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3786)|
| 1:03:12| that vendors won't renew at the CPI index is a very small percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3792)|
| 1:03:19| And, you know, our signpost, this, multiple, anything that's got metal in it is just –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3799)|
| 1:03:24| they physically will not renew it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3804)|
| 1:03:27| So what we're doing in this particular case is we're tying it to the American metals market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3807)|
| 1:03:32| That's a published index, kind of like what we do with asphalt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3812)|
| 1:03:35| that at least gives us some framework in which to work the contract with moving forward monthly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3815)|
| 1:03:41| So you said the tariffs and metal process CPI fluctuation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3821)|
| 1:03:47| We have on one side vendors that don't want to sell us stuff tied to the CPI,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3827)|
| 1:03:54| and on the other end we have vendors that don't want to buy from us on the CPI index.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3834)|
| 1:04:00| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3840)|
| 1:04:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3842)|
| 1:04:03| Is this something that – how long does this contract have left in it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3843)|
| 1:04:09| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3849)|
| 1:04:11| I think it was a five-year term like most of our contracts, but we don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3851)|
| 1:04:16| We can get you that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3856)|
| 1:04:18| Because it seems like we're adjusting a long-term contract for a short-term problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3858)|
| 1:04:22| These tariffs probably will eventually be resolved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3862)|
| 1:04:24| and the CPI will become a lot more stable like it has been in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3864)|
| 1:04:30| Can we come back to it eventually?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3870)|
| 1:04:32| And where does the – you said it was the American –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3872)|
| 1:04:35| American metals market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3875)|
| 1:04:38| It's a published – it's a federally published index monthly from my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3878)|
| 1:04:42| So it's a 30-day average?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3882)|
| 1:04:44| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3884)|
| 1:04:49| It changes daily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3889)|
| 1:04:50| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3890)|
| 1:04:51| Yeah, it fluctuates daily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3891)|
| 1:04:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3898)|
| 1:04:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3899)|
| 1:05:00| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3900)|
| 1:05:01| The Commissioner is going to make your lights no longer on, but you said –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3901)|
| 1:05:02| Director Snowden answered it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3902)|
| 1:05:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3904)|
| 1:05:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3905)|
| 1:05:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3906)|
| 1:05:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3907)|
| 1:05:08| Commissioner Boesler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3908)|
| 1:05:09| Going back, when they first started doing away with the R-12, the 9s, 12s, and the 32s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3909)|
| 1:05:14| and they free on end of it EPA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3914)|
| 1:05:17| and it may be still in effect that if you dispose of a refrigerator improperly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3917)|
| 1:05:24| they used to have with the EPA that if you see somebody doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3924)|
| 1:05:27| you can take a picture, turn them in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3927)|
| 1:05:29| and they're held anonymous in putting that file in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3929)|
| 1:05:34| And I think there's a $20,000 or $25,000 fine, and you get half of that fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3934)|
| 1:05:39| I think that may still be in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3939)|
| 1:05:41| So you could put a bounty on those refrigerators out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3941)|
| 1:05:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3949)|
| 1:05:50| Is there any other discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3950)|
| 1:05:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3952)|
| 1:05:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3953)|

| 1:06:26| Motion approved by Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3986)|
| 1:06:27| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3987)|
| 1:06:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3988)|
| 1:06:29| Second by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3989)|
| 1:06:32| What I'd like to do as part of this discussion, while this came to us under procurement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3992)|
| 1:06:37| I would like to hear from both procurement as well as recreation on parks and recreation on this particular item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=3997)|
| 1:06:44| So if you all could please provide us with an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4004)|
| 1:06:50| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4010)|
| 1:06:51| Chuck James, Knox County Parks and Recreation, 2447 Sutherland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4011)|
| 1:06:56| The community club gave us a call a couple of weeks ago, probably about a month ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4016)|
| 1:07:01| and they just wanted to donate this property to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4021)|
| 1:07:04| We are actually in about the third year of a seven-year lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4024)|
| 1:07:08| We've been using this park since 1963 for various sports, but right now we're using it for girls' softball program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4028)|
| 1:07:16| We've been paying the light bill and the water bill and stuff like that since the 60s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4036)|
| 1:07:23| So the community club is aging out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4043)|
| 1:07:26| They reached out to us and just wanted to go ahead and give it to Knox County Government Parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4046)|
| 1:07:33| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4053)|
| 1:07:34| I see a light on from Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4054)|
| 1:07:36| Just to clarify, I think I read part of the resolution that this is to be a county park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4056)|
| 1:07:42| never sold for subdivisions or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4062)|
| 1:07:45| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4065)|
| 1:07:46| That's the only requirement that they were asking that it could never be sold, always remain a county park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4066)|
| 1:07:50| And that's in the legalese and legal orders, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4070)|
| 1:07:52| Probably deed restricted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4072)|
| 1:07:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4074)|
| 1:07:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4075)|
| 1:07:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4076)|
| 1:07:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4077)|
| 1:07:58| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4078)|
| 1:07:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4079)|
| 1:08:00| Mr. James, in the document it says that Knox County is to provide a memorial bench in honor of Chris Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4080)|
| 1:08:10| Are we going to do that, I hope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4090)|
| 1:08:12| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4092)|
| 1:08:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4093)|
| 1:08:14| The Ellenberg family who donated the park in 1963, that's their grandson who passed away last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4094)|
| 1:08:22| And he was a big, he's the one that's been keeping it up all these years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4102)|
| 1:08:26| And he's passed away and nobody is there really to step up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4106)|
| 1:08:30| So Parks and Recreation is going to provide a bench.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4110)|
| 1:08:34| That's fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4114)|
| 1:08:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4116)|
| 1:08:37| Go ahead, Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4117)|

| 1:08:39| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4119)|
| 1:08:40| Can you let us know when that comes about with the county, when they're going to dedicate that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4120)|
| 1:08:44| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4124)|
| 1:08:45| So that we could all be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4125)|
| 1:08:46| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4126)|
| 1:08:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4127)|

| 1:09:42| Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4182)|
| 1:09:47| Ed Schaus, Knox County Trustee, 400 Main Street, Suite 418.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4187)|
| 1:09:52| Sherry Witt, Knox County Clerk, 300 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4192)|
| 1:09:57| In 30 seconds or less, I guess, as outlined in your caption, the Trustee's office shares offices with Sherry, with the Clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4197)|
| 1:10:10| She stays open, her offices stay open year-round, and two of ours do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4210)|
| 1:10:15| As I mentioned to you guys, what, three hours ago, we got real busy here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4215)|
| 1:10:19| We got good cash flow, but during the summer, we're sort of slow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4219)|
| 1:10:22| We have slower, minimal cash flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4222)|
| 1:10:25| So we send four people home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4225)|
| 1:10:27| The Trustee sends four people home for the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4227)|
| 1:10:29| More or less, they have a school teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4229)|
| 1:10:32| They probably go home in April and come back in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4232)|
| 1:10:36| And when we were calling our four people to come back, we found two didn't want to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4236)|
| 1:10:41| Well, I've had enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4241)|
| 1:10:42| I'm leaving town, retiring, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4242)|
| 1:10:44| So we thought, well, got to start interviewing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4244)|
| 1:10:47| Then we started thinking, well, could we maybe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4247)|
| 1:10:52| I've always worked well with Sherry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4252)|
| 1:10:53| I've registered and known her a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4253)|
| 1:10:55| So we started brainstorming it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4255)|
| 1:10:58| And bottom line, we're just in an effort to create some efficiencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4258)|
| 1:11:02| We're cross-training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4262)|
| 1:11:05| Her people are going to pick up some of the slack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4265)|
| 1:11:07| And instead of bringing, putting, I'll be specific about it, putting two people at the Farragut branch and two south,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4267)|
| 1:11:17| Trustee's office is just putting one person out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4277)|
| 1:11:20| And Sherry's staff is, this is sort of a baby step, but we hope it will work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4280)|
| 1:11:25| and we hope we can do bigger things down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4285)|
| 1:11:28| But bottom line, it's going to save the Trustee from hiring two people on this seven- or eight-month segment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4288)|
| 1:11:36| And we'll make an internal transfer, of course, and we hope the taxpayer is the beneficiary of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4296)|
| 1:11:42| So, Sherry, do you want to elaborate that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4302)|
| 1:11:45| Yes, I want to just echo everything that Ed said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4305)|
| 1:11:47| And, again, this is Farragut and South Knoxville that are the pilot programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4307)|
| 1:11:51| It seems to be working well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4311)|
| 1:11:53| And we're just real excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4313)|
| 1:11:55| So we're going to continue to have innovative ideas about how to save the taxpayers money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4315)|
| 1:12:01| And it just makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4321)|
| 1:12:04| So we're glad to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4324)|
| 1:12:06| And the clerks there have been very receptive to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4326)|
| 1:12:11| Well, if I might add, I think this is the kind of thing that our taxpayers and the citizens of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4331)|
| 1:12:17| really want to see from their government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4337)|
| 1:12:19| This just makes a lot of common sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4339)|
| 1:12:22| And I'm glad to see something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4342)|
| 1:12:23| And I hope this is the beginning of a lot of other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4343)|
| 1:12:26| I know you all are doing baby steps with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4346)|
| 1:12:28| But as things move forward, there could be a lot of other ways to either consolidate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4348)|
| 1:12:32| or find ways to maintain service and have efficiency and cut costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4352)|
| 1:12:38| Is there any other questions from any of the commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4358)|
| 1:12:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4362)|
| 1:12:43| This motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4363)|
| 1:12:45| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4365)|
| 1:12:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4367)|
| 1:12:48| All opposed, say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4368)|
| 1:12:49| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4369)|
| 1:12:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4371)|
| 1:12:53| Thanks for taking it off consent so we could give you our explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4373)|
| 1:12:57| Well, I think the public wants to hear about things like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4377)|
| 1:13:01| And I know we've got members of the media here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4381)|
| 1:13:04| Hopefully we'll share this with the community who's not at home watching this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4384)|
| 1:13:10| The next item we have is Item 43, which is line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4390)|
| 1:13:17| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4397)|
| 1:13:18| And to clarify, this is one where we pulled from this one the part related to the BMX track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4398)|
| 1:13:25| Motion to approve or send without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4405)|
| 1:13:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4408)|
| 1:13:29| There's a motion from Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4409)|
| 1:13:30| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4410)|
| 1:13:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4412)|
| 1:13:33| There's a motion from Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4413)|
| 1:13:34| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4414)|
| 1:13:35| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4415)|
| 1:13:36| Just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4416)|
| 1:13:37| Just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4417)|
| 1:13:38| You've got to do it two separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4418)|
| 1:13:43| We can't vote on ordinances tonight anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4423)|
| 1:13:47| We're doing a line item transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4427)|
| 1:13:50| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4430)|
| 1:13:52| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4432)|
| 1:13:53| I'm just a go between here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4433)|
| 1:13:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4435)|
| 1:13:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4437)|
| 1:14:03| So what is the proper motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4443)|
| 1:14:04| I didn't hear a single thing that you all said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4444)|
| 1:14:06| She said the ordinances are on first reading, so they cannot be on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4446)|
| 1:14:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4450)|
| 1:14:11| But they can't be voted on tonight anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4451)|
| 1:14:12| They can be voted with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4452)|
| 1:14:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4455)|
| 1:14:16| The motion was for no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4456)|
| 1:14:18| That's on line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4458)|
| 1:14:19| On line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4459)|
| 1:14:22| So that was the motion, and the second was by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4462)|
| 1:14:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4467)|
| 1:14:28| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4468)|
| 1:14:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4469)|
| 1:14:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4470)|
| 1:14:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4471)|
| 1:14:32| I just had a quick question on the line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4472)|
| 1:14:35| Are they instituting the new form pretty quickly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4475)|
| 1:14:39| I noticed that engineering and health department wasn't on the program yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4479)|
| 1:14:48| I think we rolled it out in the middle, and some of those were prior to us doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4488)|
| 1:14:53| Good job on the new form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4493)|
| 1:14:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4498)|
| 1:14:59| Hold on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4499)|
| 1:15:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4500)|
| 1:15:01| I've had two folks whisper in my ears that the ordinance is not on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4501)|
| 1:15:04| Let me get a clarification from the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4504)|
| 1:15:06| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4506)|
| 1:15:07| Number 41.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4507)|
| 1:15:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4508)|
| 1:15:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4509)|
| 1:15:10| Well, the proper motion is to send this through with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4510)|
| 1:15:13| And, Mr. Law Director, that motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4513)|
| 1:15:16| So I'll entertain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4516)|
| 1:15:18| I see no other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4518)|
| 1:15:19| I'll entertain a vote on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4519)|
| 1:15:22| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4522)|
| 1:15:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4524)|
| 1:15:25| All opposed, say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4525)|
| 1:15:26| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4526)|
| 1:15:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4527)|
| 1:15:28| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4528)|
| 1:15:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4529)|
| 1:15:30| The next item on our agenda is item 44.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4530)|
| 1:15:36| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4536)|
| 1:15:41| Item number 44 is spread of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4541)|
| 1:15:44| The North County Mayor's appointments to the North County Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4544)|
| 1:15:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4549)|
| 1:15:50| This particular item is, I think the proper motion may be to move this forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4550)|
| 1:15:57| There is no motion required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4557)|
| 1:15:59| It's a spread of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4559)|
| 1:16:00| They'll have to fill in the names next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4560)|
| 1:16:02| I've actually got the names were given to me right before this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4562)|
| 1:16:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4566)|
| 1:16:07| Just give them to Drew, and she can add them for the next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4567)|
| 1:16:11| I mean, it's just a spread of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4571)|
| 1:16:12| There's no vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4572)|
| 1:16:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4574)|
| 1:16:15| Well, what I'd like to do is at least go ahead and read out the Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4575)|
| 1:16:20| Mayor Jacobs, would you like to share with the commission the names of your two folks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4580)|
| 1:16:29| The names of the two people are Kim Frazier and Pastor Darrell Arnold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4589)|
| 1:16:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4593)|
| 1:16:34| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4594)|
| 1:16:39| What was the pastor's name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4599)|
| 1:16:40| Darrell Arnold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4600)|
| 1:16:41| It's on the front page of the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4601)|
| 1:16:44| Pastor Darrell Arnold and Kim Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4604)|
| 1:16:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4614)|
| 1:16:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4615)|
| 1:16:56| That was spread of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4616)|
| 1:16:57| And I think that's got us through all the items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4617)|
| 1:17:04| And to confirm, Commissioner Buster wanted item number 46 to be pulled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4624)|
| 1:17:08| So that concludes our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4628)|
| 1:17:16| I'll move on to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4636)|
| 1:17:19| Once again, I want to find out, is there anyone here who would like to address county commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4639)|
| 1:17:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4648)|
| 1:17:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4649)|
| 1:17:30| I'll entertain a motion for...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4650)|
| 1:17:33| When are we going to do announcements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4653)|
| 1:17:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4656)|
| 1:17:37| Let's go ahead and do announcements right now, Commissioner Wright, and then we'll adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4657)|
| 1:17:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4660)|
| 1:17:41| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4661)|
| 1:17:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4662)|
| 1:17:43| This is quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4663)|
| 1:17:44| Legacy Parks is having its annual luncheon, and I think there are only, like, three commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4664)|
| 1:17:48| that have signed up contributing to Legacy Parks to attend the luncheon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4668)|
| 1:17:55| I would ask my fellow commissioners to look at whether or not you can, out of your constituency fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4675)|
| 1:18:04| do $100 to Legacy Parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4684)|
| 1:18:07| Dave, we just found out it's $125, so they've gone up 25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4687)|
| 1:18:11| It's individual tickets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4691)|
| 1:18:12| He's talking about getting a table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4692)|
| 1:18:14| I think the tables are $1100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4694)|
| 1:18:20| I was unaware of the price increase, but it's still a valid request that we attend Legacy Parks' luncheon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4700)|
| 1:18:30| It must be tied to the consumer price index.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4710)|
| 1:18:33| Could I also ask who has signed up for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4713)|
| 1:18:36| I thought I've committed for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4716)|
| 1:18:41| I'm attending, but as a guest of one of my constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4721)|
| 1:18:44| I'm attending as a guest, but I'm donating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4724)|
| 1:18:49| I thought there was three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4729)|
| 1:18:51| I am attending and contributing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4731)|
| 1:18:54| I was actually also invited by a local industry and two invitations, but still yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4734)|
| 1:19:08| Go ahead, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4748)|
| 1:19:09| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4749)|
| 1:19:11| There was a couple of things that I wanted to ask before we adjourn, and nothing has to be discussed now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4751)|
| 1:19:17| We accept, like item 42, we accept roads, which is going to have a dollar figure to it in the future when we're going to have to repay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4757)|
| 1:19:26| but should we not include a dollar figure when we accept roads of what's going to cost us in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4766)|
| 1:19:32| I'm just asking we don't need to discuss it, but could we put it on at some other time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4772)|
| 1:19:36| Now, I'd like to make an announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4776)|
| 1:19:39| Saturday is the veterans' breakfast at downtown Powell Community Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4779)|

| 1:19:59| Before I move on to the next announcement, Commissioner Schoonmaker, I'm looking at you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4799)|
| 1:20:04| I'm realizing now that we've gotten to the end of our agenda, you had one other item that you wanted to discuss around Tennessee revenue collections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4804)|
| 1:20:11| What I might suggest is that perhaps we can move that to next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4811)|
| 1:20:16| Now, moving back to announcements, Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4816)|
| 1:20:21| Yes, thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4821)|
| 1:20:23| I wanted to invite everybody to the Fountain City Lions Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4823)|
| 1:20:27| Our annual spaghetti dinner is this Thursday night, October 18th, and we start at 4.30, and it goes through to 7.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4827)|
| 1:20:35| Tickets are $5, and I have purchased several, so if anybody would like one, contact me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4835)|
| 1:20:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4844)|

| 1:20:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4851)|
| 1:20:52| Also, before we close the meeting, I want to, regarding Item 41, that needs to go be taken off consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4852)|
| 1:21:01| That was an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4861)|
| 1:21:04| It's a two-level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4864)|
| 1:21:06| So the…| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4866)|
| 1:21:08| Make a motion to send without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4868)|

| 1:21:20| So the motion was from Commissioner Schoonmaker, and who was the second by?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4880)|
| 1:21:23| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267181015?start=4883)|
