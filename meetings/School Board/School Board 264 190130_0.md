| 0:12:44| Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=764)|
| 0:12:46| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=766)|
| 0:12:50| To me, our ultimate goal, of course, is just to have kids get smarter in school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=770)|
| 0:12:58| increase their academic capabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=778)|
| 0:13:02| So, when I'm looking at this kind of stuff, I'm always curious about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=782)|
| 0:13:07| why do we not have a stated ACT goal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=787)|
| 0:13:11| since we've recognized that we've had a flat ACT composite for years and years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=791)|
| 0:13:19| and it just seems like we don't have any written goal for ACT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=799)|
| 0:13:24| That's the ultimate measure of academic achievement within the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=804)|
| 0:13:30| And so, I'm just, you know, we've brought this up before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=810)|
| 0:13:35| I'm just curious about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=815)|
| 0:13:36| So, if you say something like create and implement an ACT plan for grades 9 through 12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=816)|
| 0:13:43| I'm like, well, what's your plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=823)|
| 0:13:45| What's your goal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| What's the plan to meet the goal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=826)|
| 0:13:49| And certainly that occurs at a school level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=829)|
| 0:13:51| So, whatever the, it seems like whatever your composite ACT score is at your school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=831)|
| 0:13:59| say at a high school, then you should have a goal to increase that to a certain degree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=839)|
| 0:14:07| and you should have a plan to implement to achieve that goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=847)|
| 0:14:12| So, that's my question, is do we have goals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=852)|
| 0:14:16| Do we have stated objectives for ACT?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=856)|
| 0:14:20| And if we do, where are they, and where are the plans that go with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=860)|
| 0:14:27| Mr. Thomas, would you like to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=867)|
| 0:14:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=869)|
| 0:14:30| And, of course, I think in terms of once we get in the metrics, that will be identified, I think, at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=870)|
| 0:14:36| But certainly there's not, we can put a district-wide goal in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=876)|
| 0:14:42| I know when we talk about our ready graduates, you know, the state goal is to have a 21 on the ACT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=882)|
| 0:14:51| You know, certainly we'd like for it to be better than 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=891)|
| 0:14:54| We have several schools right now that do have 21, five or six maybe that exceed, have a 21 or exceed, but a majority do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=894)|
| 0:15:02| So, we can put that in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=902)|
| 0:15:07| And also, I guess in terms of the measurability of it, what we would like that district-wide goal to be next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=907)|
| 0:15:15| and then the year after that, and then the year after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=915)|
| 0:15:17| I know the goal is to get the ready graduates 75 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=917)|
| 0:15:21| I'd rather have 100 percent ready graduates, but 75 percent of our graduates to be ready graduates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=921)|
| 0:15:28| So, we can add that in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=928)|
| 0:15:30| I don't think that's an issue at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=930)|
| 0:15:32| But as far as the measurements, the metrics would go, I think it would be more specific within the metrics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=932)|
| 0:15:38| But we can, again, add something overall to it with a district score.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=938)|
| 0:15:45| I don't know if that answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=945)|
| 0:15:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=948)|
| 0:15:49| Thank you, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=949)|
| 0:15:50| I just, has there been discussion about those types of composite scores at each school level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=950)|
| 0:15:57| Because we know we've got this range from, you know, throughout the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=957)|
| 0:16:02| from some fairly low composite scores for some schools compared to others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=962)|
| 0:16:09| And so, is there some kind of plan there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=969)|
| 0:16:12| There is, and maybe Dr. Reiswit can talk about it a little bit clearer than I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=972)|
| 0:16:17| But in terms of a plan, each school submitted their, a plan to us in terms of what their activities are for this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=977)|
| 0:16:26| in order to increase those scores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=986)|
| 0:16:28| So, I've got that information by high school, by each of our high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=988)|
| 0:16:33| But also, you know, it even extends down to middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=993)|
| 0:16:36| You know, we're piloting some of the ACT work at several middle schools too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=996)|
| 0:16:42| So, I don't know if Dr. Reiswit can add more to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1002)|
| 0:16:47| Thank you, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1007)|
| 0:16:49| I think a couple of things with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1009)|
| 0:16:51| What they do, each school does, because they're using different things for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1011)|
| 0:16:55| Some have ACT prep classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1015)|
| 0:16:57| Some do after school courses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1017)|
| 0:16:59| Some do kind of boot camps for that leading up to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1019)|
| 0:17:03| So, it kind of depends, and we leave that different for, again, we serve a diverse group of schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1023)|
| 0:17:08| so they have different ways they do those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1028)|
| 0:17:10| I think in looking at the different products that are there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1030)|
| 0:17:13| what we still see as the primary driver for ACT score composites is still economically disadvantaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1033)|
| 0:17:19| I mean, that's a big part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1039)|
| 0:17:21| Because the ACT is built such that it's kind of a culmination of what students do over their whole career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1041)|
| 0:17:27| So, it's not surprising that our feeder patterns that have the lower, like, literacy rates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1047)|
| 0:17:34| and things at their elementary school also are the ones that have the lower ACT composites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| So, you know, it's just kind of not a one-size-fits-all when we do those sorts of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1058)|
| 0:17:43| And what we've seen, if a student has a 25 or a 26,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1063)|
| 0:17:47| sometimes those ACT prep classes may help them figure out more of the system to be able to get to a 27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1067)|
| 0:17:52| But if a student has a 13, you know, it's a little harder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1072)|
| 0:17:55| because we're talking about some knowledge gap that's happened at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1075)|
| 0:17:58| So, really what we're doing as far as our early literacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1078)|
| 0:18:01| and working toward those kinds of things are our best in those places where numbers are really low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1081)|
| 0:18:06| I would just say, too, as far as looking at things, we have looked at ready graduate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1086)|
| 0:18:10| One, because the state currently has multiple ways to show and demonstrate that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1090)|
| 0:18:16| through a student may have a 20 on an ACT but has earned five college credits while they're in high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1096)|
| 0:18:21| like those sorts of things, or even industry certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1101)|
| 0:18:25| So, I think it's important that we look at that full body of ready graduate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1105)|
| 0:18:28| But all of our schools are looking at their composite score| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1108)|
| 0:18:31| and submitting plans that they're evaluating through the secondary office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1111)|
| 0:18:35| as far as what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1115)|
| 0:18:36| And in places where we see improvements, there's two schools I can think of this past year off their numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1116)|
| 0:18:41| and we're trying to look at what they're doing and see if that's something that is scalable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| or makes sense to those principles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1124)|
| 0:18:50| Mr. Norman, to your point, just for purpose of clarity and consensus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1130)|
| 0:18:59| I think what I was hearing was that specifics would be defined under the metrics at the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1139)|
| 0:19:10| So, if those specific things you were asking for, in fact, were included in the metrics section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1150)|
| 0:19:17| which would be another document, would that meet the concern that you had about...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1157)|
| 0:19:26| Yeah, I think that would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1166)|
| 0:19:29| But especially for our schools that are struggling in terms of how they do with ACT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1169)|
| 0:19:38| those schools, I think that we should have some kind of defined goal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1178)|
| 0:19:45| and an operating plan for that school to achieve some measure of increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1185)|
| 0:19:54| in terms of that composite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1194)|
| 0:19:56| So, I'd just like that discussion to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1196)|
| 0:19:59| So, as long as that's in the metric, that's what I'm looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1199)|
| 0:20:03| And to Ms. Horn's point, when under ready graduates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1203)|
| 0:20:08| she talked about create and implement an ACT plan for grades 9 through 12 for each school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1208)|
| 0:20:15| That also is another definer of each of something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1215)|
| 0:20:21| It needs to be specific per school, which I think is what I heard you asking for also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1221)|
| 0:20:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1227)|
| 0:20:29| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1229)|
| 0:20:39| I guess I'm a little concerned about what we're looking at right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1239)|
| 0:20:45| Because I really expected to have metrics by now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1245)|
| 0:20:49| I thought we were going to be considering this toward adoption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1249)|
| 0:20:56| And so, it's really concerning to look at it without any of the metrics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1256)|
| 0:21:04| And it's something that our evaluation committee has been waiting on for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1264)|
| 0:21:11| So, it's getting pushed back further and further and further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1271)|
| 0:21:15| And in January, that is quite late to be still not looking at the metrics that we need to be considering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1275)|
| 0:21:24| So, I'm very concerned that we don't have that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1284)|
| 0:21:31| In our October meeting, we were told that we would have a draft by December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1291)|
| 0:21:38| And this is a draft of the summary, but it doesn't include those metric pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1298)|
| 0:21:44| And in our October meeting, it said that we would be, the strategic plan would be considered at our January meeting, which is the meeting passed already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1304)|
| 0:21:55| And so, I really would have expected metrics by then, and that we still don't have those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1315)|
| 0:22:01| I would like to see those no later than our February meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1321)|
| 0:22:04| We need to see the metrics that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1324)|
| 0:22:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1329)|
| 0:22:10| On to that increasing student achievement, a dedicated micro-team is not something that I could support at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1330)|
| 0:22:20| We have a lot of anecdotal information from our micro-teams, but I would need to see something really concrete before I would even consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1340)|
| 0:22:34| I think our teachers are not going to support increasing a larger coaching structure when we need to be increasing classroom teachers to decrease class size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1354)|
| 0:22:48| I don't think this is the best use of our people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1368)|
| 0:22:53| Also, under assigning RTI coaches at each school to assist their data teams in determining student interventions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1373)|
| 0:23:01| I would like to see our RTI coaches working with students, not assisting our data teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1381)|
| 0:23:06| So that is also a large concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1386)|
| 0:23:09| And that's all I have in that section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1389)|
| 0:23:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1394)|
| 0:23:15| And to your point of the specific metrics, Mr. Thomas, who would be most appropriate to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1395)|
| 0:23:26| I do think something's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1406)|
| 0:23:28| We just haven't seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| We've got, Carly or John, two of you all can jump in and help me out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1410)|
| 0:23:35| I know we developed metrics around the other plan, I guess, so we've still got some of those metrics that work with this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1415)|
| 0:23:43| And there may be some additional metrics we might need to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1423)|
| 0:23:46| I think operations, Russ, I believe you developed some metrics around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1426)|
| 0:23:51| HR, I think, has got metrics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1431)|
| 0:23:53| It's not a big issue to put those together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| What we were waiting for is some discussion by the board to say, hey, this looks like what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1437)|
| 0:24:04| Go forth and bring the rest of it back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1444)|
| 0:24:08| So that was, you know, that's my fault if that didn't happen like the way that it should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1448)|
| 0:24:14| But I know there's been a lot of discussion about the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1454)|
| 0:24:17| We didn't know exactly whether the board would like this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1457)|
| 0:24:19| Would you want to start over or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1459)|
| 0:24:21| So we were just delaying a bit just for that reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1461)|
| 0:24:25| I don't know, again, Carly or John or Russ or Scott, if you all want to weigh in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1465)|
| 0:24:31| Joe, I know there's finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1471)|
| 0:24:32| I believe there's finance metrics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1472)|
| 0:24:34| The finance department submitted some metrics around finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1474)|
| 0:24:38| So it's not a big job to bring those back to the board, I don't think, at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1478)|
| 0:24:44| But we were just waiting, basically, on an endorsement to say, hey, we like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1484)|
| 0:24:49| We think you're on the right path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1489)|
| 0:24:52| And we'll be happy to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1492)|
| 0:24:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1496)|
| 0:24:57| So that sounds like it's something that can be provided, Ms. Ullen, at our next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1497)|
| 0:25:06| Is that fair, Mr. Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1506)|
| 0:25:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1508)|
| 0:25:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1509)|
| 0:25:10| I think this aligns much more with what we were requesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1510)|
| 0:25:15| And I think it's much easier for the public to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1515)|
| 0:25:21| But without that other piece, I think it's very hard for us to say what we're really looking at here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1521)|
| 0:25:30| I know the first version that we looked at, there were people that I talked to in the community who didn't even want to try to read it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1530)|
| 0:25:38| because it was so massive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| And I've not had that reaction at all from this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1540)|
| 0:25:44| It seems like this one is much more user-friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1544)|
| 0:25:47| Its language is much clearer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1547)|
| 0:25:50| It just makes more sense for a layperson, especially, to be looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1550)|
| 0:25:56| So I think that, yes, this is what we were looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1556)|
| 0:26:03| I just don't know how to really consider it without more specifics, if that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1563)|
| 0:26:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1572)|
| 0:26:13| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1573)|
| 0:26:14| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1574)|
| 0:26:16| I agree with Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1576)|
| 0:26:17| This is, I think, much easier to read and to understand what the big goals are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1577)|
| 0:26:23| So I appreciate that, and I appreciate the work that went into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1583)|
| 0:26:27| Back to Mr. Norman's point about the ACT scores, I guess as I'm looking at this, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1587)|
| 0:26:32| I understand that having those performance metrics will answer a lot of those questions and a lot of those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1592)|
| 0:26:40| Should, and I would like some feedback on this from other board members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1600)|
| 0:26:45| the strategic objectives at the top, would it be more clear if these are the specific objectives that we're looking for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1605)|
| 0:26:53| For instance, the goal ACT score for each student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1613)|
| 0:26:58| It doesn't even have to say for the district in that little objective, but for each student, that each student be at a 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1618)|
| 0:27:06| That the objective for literacy on the first one, that that be the actual proficiency rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1626)|
| 0:27:12| or that we want each student to be proficient in reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1632)|
| 0:27:16| But maybe make those objectives kind of what we're talking about more specific to the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1636)|
| 0:27:22| Maybe that's what we're missing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1642)|
| 0:27:25| So if anybody, and Dr. Reiswick, if you want to comment on that also, but if anybody, I mean, what do you guys think about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1645)|
| 0:27:33| is that, would that help enhance it so that we could, when you look at this, you see exactly what the objective is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1653)|
| 0:27:42| And then you go to the performance metrics to see what the specifics are broken down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1662)|
| 0:27:54| To your comment, Ms. Horn, the way that this is broken out, objectives, initiatives, and metrics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1674)|
| 0:28:08| I hear what you're suggesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1688)|
| 0:28:12| Objectives, if we get that specific in objectives, then sound more like goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1692)|
| 0:28:21| So, and I guess it's, I guess I like the broader, objective to me is more of a broader address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1701)|
| 0:28:33| The same with what initiatives will we use to try to reach these broad objectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1713)|
| 0:28:40| And the way we're going to know that we met them is with our performance metric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1720)|
| 0:28:45| That's just my, you know, my look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1725)|
| 0:28:49| But certainly, you know, we can look further at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1729)|
| 0:28:55| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1735)|
| 0:28:57| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1737)|
| 0:28:58| I'm realizing my notes are kind of all over the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| That's why I'm coming back to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1740)|
| 0:29:03| A couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1743)|
| 0:29:04| When we're starting to talk about the metrics, and maybe this is going a little bit to what Ms. Owens was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1744)|
| 0:29:10| I mean, I do like the fact that we're talking about the overall structure, maybe before you all get too in depth into the metrics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1750)|
| 0:29:16| But my thought, and maybe I'm wrong about this, is under the strategic initiatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1756)|
| 0:29:20| and then we have like all the bullet points, that each of these bullet points would have metrics to go along with them, I'm hoping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1760)|
| 0:29:28| So I don't know if that's the thought or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1768)|
| 0:29:31| But I am hoping that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1771)|
| 0:29:32| And I do hope that, to me, I think that our metrics need to be pushing our district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1772)|
| 0:29:39| And so I hope when we're looking at metrics, it's not necessarily just the easy win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1779)|
| 0:29:43| But, you know, probably maybe we won't do it, but this is the challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1783)|
| 0:29:47| So that was one of the things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| But under this increased student achievement, one other thing that I don't know where this might fit into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1789)|
| 0:29:55| and maybe it's under personalized learning, is we have talked so much about magnet programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1795)|
| 0:29:59| and this has just been on our radar, that when I looked at the plan, I don't feel like I saw magnet programs addressed anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1799)|
| 0:30:07| And I do think that should be included somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1807)|
| 0:30:11| And I think part of that is an ongoing assessment of what is working with our magnet programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1811)|
| 0:30:17| Do we need to expand them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1817)|
| 0:30:19| You know, just an ongoing focus so that I would hope that since they are part of our school system in many different ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1819)|
| 0:30:26| that they are mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| And I guess I'm thinking maybe it's under personalized learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1828)|
| 0:30:31| I'm not really sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1831)|
| 0:30:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1835)|
| 0:30:36| Mr. McMillan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| Actually, Mr. Norman was before me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1838)|
| 0:30:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1842)|
| 0:30:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1843)|
| 0:30:44| I was just going to make a comment in reference to ACT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| And as long as we require everyone to take the ACT, realistically, no matter what we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1848)|
| 0:31:01| along the lines of what Dr. Ryswick said, some people just don't have the background to achieve anywhere as close to 20 or 21 or 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1861)|
| 0:31:14| But it does concern me that we have these kids, and we have them in every school, every high school, I'm sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1874)|
| 0:31:26| that just go through the motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1886)|
| 0:31:30| They just know that they have to take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1890)|
| 0:31:33| I'm just going to go down there and mark something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1893)|
| 0:31:36| Are we willing to look at establishing some kind of a minimum score?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1896)|
| 0:31:45| It could be a very, you know, a very liberal score.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1905)|
| 0:31:53| But would that, unless there's some penalty, I guess what I'm saying is the only way to stop a kid from doing that, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1913)|
| 0:32:02| is there has to be some kind of penalty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| If the kid knows there's no penalty, I just have to mark this, and I walk across the stage after 13 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1925)|
| 0:32:11| no matter what I make on it, you know, you're not going to, you can have teachers, guidance counselors, coaches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1931)|
| 0:32:19| everybody preach to them, and they're going to blow you off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1939)|
| 0:32:23| You know, they're just not going to pay any attention unless there is some kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1943)|
| 0:32:28| And like I said, it could be very, very low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1948)|
| 0:32:32| But in my opinion, we should establish or at least look at establishing some kind of a minimum score| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1952)|
| 0:32:41| that they realistically could attain unless they're, you know, some kind of very special ed or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1961)|
| 0:32:52| that would provide a little bit of incentive to maybe at least put forth the effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1972)|
| 0:33:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1980)|
| 0:33:02| So for clarification, are you stating that that's something that you might want staff to look at under the metrics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1982)|
| 0:33:10| the performance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1990)|
| 0:33:11| Well, I don't know where else you would look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1991)|
| 0:33:14| While we're talking about the upper end and we're talking about boosting the score, you know, as I was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=1994)|
| 0:33:21| rising time raises all boats, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2001)|
| 0:33:26| And forgive me, Board, I'm trying to be real specific on this as staff takes notes so that they'll have, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2006)|
| 0:33:33| some specific guidance on what might need to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2013)|
| 0:33:38| Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2018)|
| 0:33:40| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2020)|
| 0:33:41| Yeah, I think Mike's got a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2021)|
| 0:33:44| We all know that kids will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2024)|
| 0:33:46| They'll draw Christmas trees with their whatever just to get through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2026)|
| 0:33:53| And it seems like we could come up for a regular ed diploma, some minimum score.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2033)|
| 0:34:00| It's 15 or 14 or whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2040)|
| 0:34:04| And that would stop this kind of randomness type thing that kids will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2044)|
| 0:34:11| I certainly think that's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2051)|
| 0:34:14| My other observation has to do with literacy and, again, trying to be trying to have some specific goals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2054)|
| 0:34:26| specific measurable, you know, something that's tangible that we can shoot for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2066)|
| 0:34:35| And as regards literacy, we know that one of our major black guys is the literacy rate in the high poverty schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2075)|
| 0:34:44| So if that's at close to 80 percent, I think that's where we were failing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2084)|
| 0:34:51| We had 80 percent of the kids at the third grade level were not classified as literate in high poverty schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2091)|
| 0:34:59| And so that's just amazing to me that we don't have a very specific goal about what we expect in these high poverty schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2099)|
| 0:35:12| how we're going to change that number and what is the number that we're shooting for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2112)|
| 0:35:20| and what is the operating plan to achieve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2120)|
| 0:35:24| Eighty percent illiteracy, third grade, high poverty, of course, we can't live with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2124)|
| 0:35:32| But we need something specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2132)|
| 0:35:37| Thank you, Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2137)|
| 0:35:43| It's not working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2143)|
| 0:35:46| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| I just have to raise your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2148)|
| 0:35:52| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2152)|
| 0:35:53| It wasn't on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2153)|
| 0:35:54| It may be me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2154)|
| 0:35:55| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2155)|
| 0:35:58| Let me just first say that I think I like this document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2158)|
| 0:36:02| and I think that they did a good job in taking what we said at the retreat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2162)|
| 0:36:09| and bringing it back to us in a very user-friendly way that, because to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2169)|
| 0:36:16| I see this as more the introduction to Knox County Schools, what we're about, what we're wanting to achieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2176)|
| 0:36:23| So if what I'm hearing is the discussion tonight, if the staff can make the changes that the board's recommending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2183)|
| 0:36:31| then we would go forward, which is what you all have been waiting on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2191)|
| 0:36:36| and hopefully have some metrics for us by the February meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2196)|
| 0:36:40| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2200)|
| 0:36:41| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2201)|
| 0:36:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2202)|
| 0:36:43| So I think that is, and I think those metrics are highly important, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2203)|
| 0:36:51| But I think to get what we had before for a five-year plan was a large book that had a lot of detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2211)|
| 0:36:59| that would be overwhelming to anybody looking it up and picking it up for the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2219)|
| 0:37:05| So I like this, if we could just have the metrics added to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2225)|
| 0:37:10| To Ms. Babbitt's point, I would be fine with adding the magnet schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2230)|
| 0:37:15| but I don't want to limit us to the term magnet schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2235)|
| 0:37:18| I like the fact that we could mention that we have different options or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2238)|
| 0:37:23| I know that it is, there are specifics spelled out under the third bullet point under ready graduates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2243)|
| 0:37:31| and that's okay, but I just hate to limit us to a term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2251)|
| 0:37:36| So if there's some way, I mean, I would support it if the board's will is to have magnet schools listed in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2256)|
| 0:37:42| but I would rather it be more generic so we can pursue other avenues as well and continue those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2262)|
| 0:37:50| but not just limit us to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2270)|
| 0:37:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2274)|
| 0:37:58| My comment before moving along, I really support what she said, Ms. Bounds, about this is a document to introduce our schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2278)|
| 0:38:11| and I just would like to caution the board that we not get too bogged down in the specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2291)|
| 0:38:20| That can happen through the metrics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2300)|
| 0:38:22| That can happen through a planning document as opposed to a policy document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2302)|
| 0:38:31| This isn't policy, but they're two very different pieces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2311)|
| 0:38:36| and this really is more of a this is what we're about and this is what we represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2316)|
| 0:38:43| So I just encourage the board to keep that in mind as we're making some of these recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2323)|
| 0:38:50| I think one of the issues we had before, to your point, Ms. Owens, about how the first document just went on and on and on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2330)|
| 0:38:58| that was tough, too, because we did, we got bogged down in all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2338)|
| 0:39:09| So, all right, any more comments on the first section, increasing student achievement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2349)|
| 0:39:15| I'll move on to the eliminating disparities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2355)|
| 0:39:19| Any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2359)|
| 0:39:25| Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2367)|
| 0:39:28| I have a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| I just kind of want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| You okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2373)|
| 0:39:36| I just want to kind of see how it will play out and what we're thinking about as a district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2376)|
| 0:39:41| So under organizational infrastructure, to create a minority educator advisory council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2381)|
| 0:39:46| who will make up this council and what are the thoughts of guiding that, et cetera?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2386)|
| 0:39:54| I think the idea around that was our minority teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2394)|
| 0:39:59| I know I've spoken with one of our teachers who represents Pecker Group for the teachers about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2399)|
| 0:40:06| So I think we need to do more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2406)|
| 0:40:10| Are we doing all we can do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| I don't think we are, but just getting some ideas and some thoughts from our minority educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2412)|
| 0:40:20| So that's pretty much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| Okay, so it will be made up of Knox County minority teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2422)|
| 0:40:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2425)|
| 0:40:26| So I wasn't sure if it was a community group or within the Knox County school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2426)|
| 0:40:30| And you all will take the input to move the district forward ideally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2430)|
| 0:40:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2436)|
| 0:40:37| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2437)|
| 0:40:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2438)|
| 0:40:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2440)|
| 0:40:42| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2442)|
| 0:40:43| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| On the final point under organizational infrastructure, update all job descriptions to include cultural awareness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2445)|
| 0:40:52| and proficiency as a criterion for employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2452)|
| 0:40:56| I guess I'm just a little bit concerned about what will we be doing to measure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2456)|
| 0:41:03| if we're interviewing a candidate for employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2463)|
| 0:41:12| Okay, I was making a note there, Ms. Horne, too, on the previous item we were talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2472)|
| 0:41:18| So could you repeat that again for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2478)|
| 0:41:21| On the third point that says update all job descriptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2481)|
| 0:41:24| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2484)|
| 0:41:25| How would we go about ensuring that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2485)|
| 0:41:31| How would that be measured?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| I think Scott has some ideas about that, so if we could let him address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2493)|
| 0:41:39| I've got Dr. Brooke Denard-Rosser who can actually speak to those things in terms of what's been asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2499)|
| 0:41:47| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2507)|
| 0:41:48| Hi, I'm Brooke Denard-Rosser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2508)|
| 0:41:49| Thanks for having me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2509)|
| 0:41:50| Thank you, Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2510)|
| 0:41:51| So what we were looking at is one, it's basically revising all of the district's current job descriptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2511)|
| 0:41:56| to include a component of cultural competency so that it's already embedded within the job description.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2516)|
| 0:42:01| So then people who are there for applying for those positions understand that that is an expectation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2521)|
| 0:42:05| of their employment with the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| So it's just basically the process of going through and updating all of our existing job descriptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2527)|
| 0:42:11| to include a component of cultural competency as a requirement for employment with the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2531)|
| 0:42:16| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2536)|
| 0:42:17| My pleasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2537)|
| 0:42:22| Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2542)|
| 0:42:23| Well, I guess I'm curious, I'm still asking Susan's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2543)|
| 0:42:29| So I understand updating the job descriptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2549)|
| 0:42:32| What's the measurement to indicate, okay, we hired this person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2552)|
| 0:42:38| and how do we know that they're following cultural competency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2558)|
| 0:42:44| and how do we know if that, is it just more of an expectation coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2564)|
| 0:42:47| or is there actual measurements that's going to go behind it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2567)|
| 0:42:51| So it's kind of a built-in accountability structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2571)|
| 0:42:54| So by having it outlined in detail in the requirements of the job description and position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2574)|
| 0:42:59| in the event that there were to be an issue or something that were to arise that would demonstrate a lack of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2579)|
| 0:43:03| cultural competency or a lack of alignment with the district's views about what cultural competency looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2583)|
| 0:43:08| from a teacher, then we'd be able to refer back to that job description| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2588)|
| 0:43:12| and remind whoever the person was or whatever position it was that that was a component of their hiring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2592)|
| 0:43:18| or their being an employee of the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2598)|
| 0:43:22| So it's more of a built-in accountability structure so that when we do have incidences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2602)|
| 0:43:26| or when an issue does arise, we've got something that we can go back to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2606)|
| 0:43:31| It also would align with the cultural competency training that's currently being done across the district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2611)|
| 0:43:35| so that would kind of be one of the metrics that could be used in terms of determining effectiveness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2615)|
| 0:43:41| Ms. Holland?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| Has that been discussed with the PECA team?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2623)|
| 0:43:49| No. To my knowledge, we've not had a conversation with the PECA team about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2629)|
| 0:43:54| So that's something we can certainly do at our next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2634)|
| 0:44:05| Okay. Any more comments on that second section?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2645)|
| 0:44:09| All right. Moving along to Section 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2649)|
| 0:44:12| Oh, I'm sorry, Ms. Babb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| Yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| On Section 2, down under, and I don't know where this fits, but it seems like everything about recruitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2656)|
| 0:44:23| and things like that is under organizational infrastructure, and I definitely support the hiring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2663)|
| 0:44:31| and trying to get rid of biases and exclusion and trying to diversify our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2671)|
| 0:44:38| But one thing I feel like I'm never seeing is that we really want excellent teachers in our school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2678)|
| 0:44:45| and that to me is a huge goal, and I feel like there need to be metrics behind that on how we're going about getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2685)|
| 0:44:52| excellent teachers, not only getting them but retaining them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2692)|
| 0:44:57| So I would like that in there somewhere, because I just feel like that's so important to moving our kids forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2697)|
| 0:45:03| to where we go is the excellence of our teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2703)|
| 0:45:06| So that's one point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2706)|
| 0:45:08| Also under student support, I feel like there's a lot about training on the cultural competencies, PBIS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2708)|
| 0:45:16| and everything like that, but one other thing I don't feel like I'm seeing is a goal of further supporting our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2716)|
| 0:45:24| through social workers, guidance counselors, and mental health professionals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2724)|
| 0:45:29| and I feel like that's one of the big needed supports for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2729)|
| 0:45:37| There's a lot about training our staff that's already there, but I feel like there's also the need for how are we strategically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2737)|
| 0:45:43| going to work to get more support within each school along those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2743)|
| 0:45:49| So that's point two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2749)|
| 0:45:51| And then the third point I had is, and maybe this is embedded in here, and I don't need to call this out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2751)|
| 0:45:57| but I do feel like the special ed population is never really specifically talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2757)|
| 0:46:03| and maybe it comes under equity of student access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2763)|
| 0:46:06| Maybe it's implied under improved support for underserved student populations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2766)|
| 0:46:11| and so maybe, Mr. Thomas, you can speak to that, but I just feel like looking through our whole plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2771)|
| 0:46:17| I didn't feel like that population really was ever addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2777)|
| 0:46:21| And if it is, just kind of in a more broader sense, then that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| I just was wondering about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2784)|
| 0:46:30| Do you have any comments, Mr. Thomas, on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2790)|
| 0:46:33| No, other than just taking some notes to make sure we can reflect what's being asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2793)|
| 0:46:40| Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2800)|
| 0:46:41| I think to Virginia's point of making sure that we put excellent teachers on here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2801)|
| 0:46:46| under a narrow achievement gap, I think that that might be a good place to fit that in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2806)|
| 0:46:51| because that's where it's kind of talking about incentives, et cetera, for teachers to move the needle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2811)|
| 0:46:57| I just want to just put it on the radar as we move forward, because this is a five-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2817)|
| 0:47:04| that under student support, where we have PBIS and restorative practices for each school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2824)|
| 0:47:11| if we're going to go on and adopt this document in a five-year plan with the restorative practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2831)|
| 0:47:17| that I would like the district to really support, ensuring that there's more training for restorative practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2837)|
| 0:47:23| if this is something that we're going to commit to and keep it in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2843)|
| 0:47:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2850)|
| 0:47:34| Thank you, Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2854)|
| 0:47:36| I think we're actually looking at probably a three-year plan instead of five, just for your information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2856)|
| 0:47:45| Any other comments on Section 2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2865)|
| 0:47:53| I don't know that this hits the points, Ms. Babb, that you were talking about as far as excellence in teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2873)|
| 0:48:10| In the increasing student achievement, we do talk about promote student learning and instruction delivered by highly trained teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2890)|
| 0:48:23| I know that's not the same wording you were looking for, but that might be a place to change your word or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2903)|
| 0:48:30| And maybe there's metrics that can support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2910)|
| 0:48:33| I think there is talk about recruitment on BISE's things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2913)|
| 0:48:38| I just think overall, I mean, that is the number one thing that is going to move the dial is having we already have excellent teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2918)|
| 0:48:44| but just the continued recruitment of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2924)|
| 0:48:47| And then in the second, eliminating disparities, a strategic objective, again, not near as specific,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2927)|
| 0:48:56| but kind of steps around the promote social and emotional learning and well-being for the whole child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2936)|
| 0:49:04| And, of course, we know under that, you know, achieving that objective means more support personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2944)|
| 0:49:13| But to your point, maybe it does need to be more specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2953)|
| 0:49:17| And maybe, once again, it's the metrics underneath that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2957)|
| 0:49:20| I just support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2960)|
| 0:49:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2965)|
| 0:49:27| Moving on to section three, creating a positive culture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2967)|
| 0:49:37| Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2977)|
| 0:49:43| I want to kind of look at, so I just kind of want to see, well, get an understanding of what the district culture survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2983)|
| 0:49:49| I know, Superintendent, you and I had a conversation about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2989)|
| 0:49:52| But what would this look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2992)|
| 0:49:54| Who is included in providing the feedback?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2994)|
| 0:49:57| My preference would be a district-wide, like a 360 type of survey where you provide anonymous feedback, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=2997)|
| 0:50:06| where principals and teachers can give honest feedback but be still secure in their positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3006)|
| 0:50:13| And so I just want to kind of talk about the district culture survey and what that looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3013)|
| 0:50:16| and what's the goal that we're trying to get out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3016)|
| 0:50:23| Well, I know, I think, was it last year, Dr. Reiswick, I think REA did a survey, a district-wide survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3023)|
| 0:50:30| and teachers, principals, all employees, I believe, were involved in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3030)|
| 0:50:35| And taking that information, of course, in terms of building a positive culture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3035)|
| 0:50:39| seeing where we are currently and what kinds of things that we need to be doing in order to enhance our culture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3039)|
| 0:50:46| So I know I've looked at that information, but I would envision we do do that again just through our REA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3046)|
| 0:50:55| I think, and I don't know, Dr. Reiswick, did we provide that report to the board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3055)|
| 0:50:59| I can't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| We can go back and look to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3061)|
| 0:51:04| And send that to you, too, so you can have an idea of what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3064)|
| 0:51:08| I know families, we even did surveys where families, I think, also responded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3068)|
| 0:51:14| So we'll get you that information, but I would envision doing something similar again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3074)|
| 0:51:19| And like we talked about, too, from a central office perspective, how do the school, what is the perception?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3079)|
| 0:51:27| Do the schools feel like, yes, we do have a responsive central office that provides us with the support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3087)|
| 0:51:35| and resources as minimum as they are, but gives us the kinds of supports that we're looking for from a central office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3095)|
| 0:51:43| So that helps us to say, okay, yeah, we're doing, our stakeholders believe we're doing a good job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3103)|
| 0:51:52| or no, we're not doing a good job, and so what are the areas we need to improve in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3112)|
| 0:51:56| So that's kind of the idea for me about the survey information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3116)|
| 0:52:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3125)|
| 0:52:06| Ms. Fab?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3126)|
| 0:52:08| Okay, I had one comment under, we are in creative positive culture, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3128)|
| 0:52:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3132)|
| 0:52:13| On the safety and security, our one bullet point on there really deals mostly with the SRO officers and personnel there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3133)|
| 0:52:22| I do feel like, and I guess I've just seen it in my own district with some lockdowns and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3142)|
| 0:52:30| developing on the security side some kind of communication plan with parents and students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3150)|
| 0:52:36| And I say that realizing we can't share what's going on with all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3156)|
| 0:52:41| But I do think that, and I especially see it at the high school level where there are students that are not always with an adult,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3161)|
| 0:52:50| you know, the entire school day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3170)|
| 0:52:54| I just would like something added about how we communicate something about safety with our parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3174)|
| 0:53:01| and it's an ongoing, and this kind of goes with metrics, that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3181)|
| 0:53:05| the parents can understand the ongoing need to change this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3185)|
| 0:53:09| I mean, it's, you know, it probably changes weekly depending on what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3189)|
| 0:53:13| But I feel like the safety just needs to be expanded a little bit more beyond just the fact that we're dealing with our SRO officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3193)|
| 0:53:21| And then I do have one question, and this is my lack of acronym knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3201)|
| 0:53:25| On understakeholder communication engagements, what are PACs, TACs, and FACs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3205)|
| 0:53:34| I could take an educated guess on most of them, but I'll give that to you, Dr. Reiswig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3214)|
| 0:53:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3221)|
| 0:53:42| PAC, TAC, FAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3222)|
| 0:53:43| Thank you, Ms. Hilliard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3223)|
| 0:53:44| They're the different advisory councils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3224)|
| 0:53:46| We have a principal advisory council that meets monthly that we bring things before them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3226)|
| 0:53:50| a teacher advisory council that Mr. Thomas meets with on a monthly basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3230)|
| 0:53:54| and then a family advisory council that Ms. Tammy Campbell leads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3234)|
| 0:53:58| and they meet monthly as well to kind of talk about the same issues prior to decisions being made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3238)|
| 0:54:02| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3242)|
| 0:54:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3243)|
| 0:54:04| I knew what all those were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3244)|
| 0:54:05| I just didn't know what acronyms meant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3245)|
| 0:54:07| And then my one other one under the stakeholder communication engagement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3247)|
| 0:54:11| and this came up in our joint commission, our task force with the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3251)|
| 0:54:16| is really them wanting to see it, and it made me realize I'd like to see it too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3256)|
| 0:54:20| is I do think we need to be having, and maybe we'll have it this year and I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3260)|
| 0:54:24| a yearly end-of-year report on progress for the strategic plan that's actually put out publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3264)|
| 0:54:31| So I would like that to be something added as far as communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3271)|
| 0:54:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3275)|
| 0:54:36| Ms. Bounds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3276)|
| 0:54:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3277)|
| 0:54:38| To Ms. Babb's point, it might be a good idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3278)|
| 0:54:40| given that you, Dr. Risely, tell us what all those were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3280)|
| 0:54:46| that we be more specific when we're putting this document out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3286)|
| 0:54:51| If you want to say advisory councils and then put PAC, TAC, and FACT in parentheses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3291)|
| 0:54:57| but I think it does probably need to be expounded upon a little bit there or renamed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3297)|
| 0:55:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3307)|
| 0:55:09| Any other questions, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3309)|
| 0:55:17| Ms. Horn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3317)|
| 0:55:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3319)|
| 0:55:20| Just two other ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3320)|
| 0:55:23| One question on NOCS support, so on the NOCS leads part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3323)|
| 0:55:29| Are you ready to move to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3329)|
| 0:55:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3330)|
| 0:55:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3331)|
| 0:55:32| On the NOCS support, the goal of reducing absenteeism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3332)|
| 0:55:38| how is remembering something else under that goal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3338)|
| 0:55:41| Is there something else around community support, community partnerships,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3341)|
| 0:55:45| that we need to have under that, Dr. Risely?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3345)|
| 0:55:50| Thank you, Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3350)|
| 0:55:52| We have kind of three big metrics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| One for each one of those is kind of like the one to bring attention to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3354)|
| 0:55:58| but there are also sub points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3358)|
| 0:56:00| And part of both the supports and reads are to build pipelines to families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3360)|
| 0:56:04| and to communities that currently exist that we would just tag along other organizations for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3364)|
| 0:56:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3369)|
| 0:56:10| So you were really just highlighting one per area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3370)|
| 0:56:12| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3372)|
| 0:56:13| It's kind of our big metric so we can measure against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3373)|
| 0:56:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3375)|
| 0:56:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3376)|
| 0:56:17| And then the other piece on the mission statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3377)|
| 0:56:23| I guess I would like to just look at the mission statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3383)|
| 0:56:26| and really maybe expand it a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3386)|
| 0:56:29| and think about this as our way of dreaming a little bit for our kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3389)|
| 0:56:34| and what we envision for them, lifelong learners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3394)|
| 0:56:39| that they are, you know, becoming, contributing members of society,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3399)|
| 0:56:44| that kind of thing, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3404)|
| 0:56:45| I don't have the exact verbiage that I'm thinking of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3405)|
| 0:56:48| but just something so that we're dreaming a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3408)|
| 0:56:50| maybe not such a clinical little response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3410)|
| 0:56:53| but something that just really communicates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3413)|
| 0:56:56| kind of wraps this whole thing up with what we truly envision for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3416)|
| 0:57:01| So that's just kind of a thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3421)|
| 0:57:05| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3425)|
| 0:57:06| Actually, what we used was a mission statement that a previous board, I guess, adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3426)|
| 0:57:12| So since there's not been any other adoption by a board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3432)|
| 0:57:15| we didn't have anything else to go from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3435)|
| 0:57:18| But we'd be glad to develop something else and seek your approval for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3438)|
| 0:57:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3444)|
| 0:57:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3445)|
| 0:57:26| I have a suggestion I'll send you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3446)|
| 0:57:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3447)|
| 0:57:28| Excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3448)|
| 0:57:29| Ms. Bounds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3449)|
| 0:57:30| But is there a differentiation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3450)|
| 0:57:31| Because this mission statement above our names sounds like not a system wide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3451)|
| 0:57:39| which I'm not opposed to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3459)|
| 0:57:41| but it sounds more like the Board of Education mission statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3461)|
| 0:57:45| Do we have another one that's like a system wide one that would develop more what Ms. Horne's talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3465)|
| 0:57:54| and kind of get away from our last one, something succinct that is memorable and people can grab hold of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3474)|
| 0:58:02| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3482)|
| 0:58:05| Carly, I'm not aware of anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3485)|
| 0:58:08| This is what's on the plaque hanging in the smallest boardroom behind the main boardroom over at the Andrew Johnson Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3488)|
| 0:58:16| So that's where this was taken from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3496)|
| 0:58:19| And, of course, I've been around a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| There have been different mission statements for the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3501)|
| 0:58:24| So let us take a crack at developing something for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3504)|
| 0:58:30| And then y'all can determine what you don't want or want about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3510)|
| 0:58:37| Do you mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3517)|
| 0:58:38| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3518)|
| 0:58:39| Because I think here's what I'm seeing is that I love, love, love, love the whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3519)|
| 0:58:47| Knox leads, Knox reads, Knox advances, Knox supports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3527)|
| 0:58:52| And then you get to the mission statement and it's all about us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3532)|
| 0:58:56| And if we're going to involve the whole community like we're trying to do with the Knox leads, Knox reads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3536)|
| 0:59:02| Knox advances and Knox supports, then I think that it needs to be, if this is the only mission statement we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3542)|
| 0:59:10| it needs to be more encompassing of the whole community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3550)|
| 0:59:14| I don't mind a separate mission statement saying we're the governing body, you know, this is what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3554)|
| 0:59:20| But I just think there needs to be a mission statement that's more inclusive if to go along with Knox leads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3560)|
| 0:59:28| reads, advances and supports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3568)|
| 0:59:30| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3570)|
| 0:59:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3571)|
| 0:59:32| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3572)|
| 0:59:33| And, Ms. Bounds, just for clarification, Ms. Coatney just gave me the history on this mission statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3573)|
| 0:59:39| And, Mike, you may or may not have been on the Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3579)|
| 0:59:42| but it was a prior Board that during their retreat had a facilitator come in and walk them through a specific mission statement for the Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3582)|
| 0:59:54| So that, and you're right, that is a very different animal than what it would be for our system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3594)|
| 1:00:02| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3602)|
| 1:00:03| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3603)|
| 1:00:04| I just want to speak to this point that I actually, going through this, started Googling our mission statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3604)|
| 1:00:09| And what's really interesting, the first mission statement that comes up, if you Google Knox County Schools mission statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3609)|
| 1:00:15| is the security department's mission statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| And what I've kind of realized is there are a lot of different mission statements for different departments of the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3617)|
| 1:00:22| And it took me going to the Board site to find this mission statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3622)|
| 1:00:26| With that being said, I think we do need, I think there is a big differentiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3626)|
| 1:00:30| And I do think our school system could use a mission statement, which I think it needs to be more lofty than what this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3630)|
| 1:00:38| And I think we need to decide, does the Board need its own mission statement separate, or is there a big one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3638)|
| 1:00:44| So I think that's kind of a discussion to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3644)|
| 1:00:48| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3648)|
| 1:00:49| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3649)|
| 1:00:50| Yeah, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3650)|
| 1:00:51| I think that's what I was thinking, something that we can put a little heart in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3651)|
| 1:00:56| And I think, I mean, my opinion would be that the Board's mission statement would be to support our school system's mission statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3656)|
| 1:01:02| So I don't think we need another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3662)|
| 1:01:05| I think we just need a good mission statement for our school system, and that that's what we'll support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3665)|
| 1:01:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3671)|
| 1:01:14| Madam Chair, let me ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3674)|
| 1:01:16| Do you want us to try to do something, or would the Board just like to come up with a statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3676)|
| 1:01:23| What's the pleasure of the Board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| Do we want to collectively work on one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3685)|
| 1:01:27| Do we want to ask the staff to bring us one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3687)|
| 1:01:31| Oh, I was just going to jokingly say, I heard Ms. Horne say she was going to offer one up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3691)|
| 1:01:36| So it doesn't matter to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3696)|
| 1:01:39| I think if the Board wanted to submit some suggestions, maybe it would be a starting point for the staff to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3699)|
| 1:01:47| So we'll test you with that, Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3707)|
| 1:01:51| Ms. Horne's got a good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3711)|
| 1:01:52| I can just tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3712)|
| 1:01:55| You know, this conversation began months and months ago with looking at the seven keys of success from a couple of other districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3715)|
| 1:02:05| So I just looked at a couple of those, and so that's what I've sent to Ms. Harrington that she can take a look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3725)|
| 1:02:11| It's just another district's mission statement that is kind of a lofty, bigger vision, and so that's what I've sent to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3731)|
| 1:02:19| So if anybody has, you know, other things they want to add or would like to see incorporated, maybe you can send it to her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3739)|
| 1:02:26| and she can work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3746)|
| 1:02:28| So that's just my thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3748)|
| 1:02:32| Oh, I was laughing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3752)|
| 1:02:34| Forgive me, I was laughing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3754)|
| 1:02:35| Poor Carly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3755)|
| 1:02:36| She's just got another thing on her plate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3756)|
| 1:02:41| But I can give you a little history on the security mission statement coming up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3761)|
| 1:02:47| because there was a day, Ms. Massey, you will remember for sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3767)|
| 1:02:51| where every department was charged with sitting down and writing a mission statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3771)|
| 1:02:56| So I'm not surprised that when you Google it, you get them from so many different places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3776)|
| 1:03:03| Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3783)|
| 1:03:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3784)|
| 1:03:05| I do think it's important, very important for us to have something that we agree on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3785)|
| 1:03:11| I'm not very comfortable with this particular mission statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3791)|
| 1:03:15| so I would like to have the opportunity to offer some ideas and share ideas with other people that are on this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3795)|
| 1:03:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3806)|
| 1:03:29| Are there any more comments on the NOTS leads, reads, advances page?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3809)|
| 1:03:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3818)|
| 1:03:39| Seeing none, staff, do you have any questions or clarification that you need from us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3819)|
| 1:03:48| before you go back and make some of these revisions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3828)|
| 1:03:55| Anything come to mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3835)|
| 1:03:59| Mr. Davis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3839)|
| 1:04:00| Dr. Davis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3840)|
| 1:04:03| No, I can't think of anything at this time, but I'm glad to do anything that you need to assist in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3843)|
| 1:04:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3850)|
| 1:04:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3851)|
| 1:04:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3852)|
| 1:04:13| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3853)|
| 1:04:15| So is the board's desire to have a new mission statement also written to be included in this document before we go to print?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3855)|
| 1:04:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3865)|
| 1:04:26| Then let me encourage each of you to think hard and to submit some suggestions to Ms. Harrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3866)|
| 1:04:40| And I appreciate that Ms. Horne and Mr. Norman have both got some ideas already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3880)|
| 1:04:46| Ms. Babb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3886)|
| 1:04:47| Well, I do think we need to do it simultaneously because I do think your mission statement is up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3887)|
| 1:04:52| and our strategic plan, which I think would, but it needs to follow it, so I don't think it can be done totally separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3892)|
| 1:04:59| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3899)|
| 1:05:00| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3900)|
| 1:05:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3901)|
| 1:05:02| Any other questions, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3902)|
| 1:05:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3905)|
| 1:05:06| Thank you, board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3906)|
| 1:05:09| Moving along, the next bullet point is discussion of special ed staff recruitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3909)|
| 1:05:16| Mr. Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3916)|
| 1:05:19| Yes, at this time, Madam Chair, members of the board, Ms. Missy Drennan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3919)|
| 1:05:25| and Dr. Brooke Rosser are going to make a presentation to the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3925)|
| 1:05:32| so we'll do this before we get into the budget conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3932)|
| 1:05:36| So at this time, I'll just turn it over to Missy and Brooke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3936)|
| 1:05:40| Thank you, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3940)|
| 1:05:41| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3941)|
| 1:05:42| So as we approach the recruitment time, I went to Dr. Rosser and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3942)|
| 1:05:47| I would really like to really activate our department in recruiting because, as you all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3947)|
| 1:05:53| from when I was here in the fall, we started out the school year with 21 vacancies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3953)|
| 1:05:58| and we have several of our teachers that are going to take advantage of the retirement incentive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3958)|
| 1:06:02| and so that led to this discussion and this presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3962)|
| 1:06:06| And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Dr. Rosser,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3966)|
| 1:06:08| and then I'll come back at the end to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3968)|
| 1:06:12| Thank you, Madam Chair and board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3972)|
| 1:06:14| So I am going to kind of walk you all through the presentation I put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3974)|
| 1:06:18| This just kind of gives you all some background and context around what we're looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3978)|
| 1:06:22| and then I will jump right into the three separate proposals that we are recommending for approval by this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3982)|
| 1:06:29| So the first slide kind of talks about what we know as it relates to anticipated need for special ed teachers at the elementary level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3989)|
| 1:06:38| So on average each year we hire around 25 elementary certified SPED teachers and four in pre-K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=3998)|
| 1:06:45| Based on what we know currently about projected vacancies going into the 19-20 school year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4005)|
| 1:06:51| in addition to the above noted numbers, we'll have five SPED elementary teachers we'll need to find,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4011)|
| 1:06:56| in addition to three school psychologists with the addition of one projected addition of a school psychologist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4016)|
| 1:07:02| and then three speech-language pathologists with the potential addition of four projected speech-language pathologists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4022)|
| 1:07:09| So that's what we're looking at for elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4029)|
| 1:07:12| The next slide takes a look at middle and high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4032)|
| 1:07:19| So on average at the middle and high school levels we see average attrition around 25 for each level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4039)|
| 1:07:26| so that's a total of 50 and roughly one facilitator retirement at that level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4046)|
| 1:07:31| In addition to those projected numbers based on annual attrition, we're anticipating an additional eight SPED teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4051)|
| 1:07:37| and notably five vision specialists that we'll need to fill going into the 19-20 school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4057)|
| 1:07:44| So kind of what's the big picture? Here's what we know heading into 19-20 school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4064)|
| 1:07:49| On average we're going to likely need to hire between 80 and 95 new SPED teachers for the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4069)|
| 1:07:56| In addition to those teachers, we're also going to need to look at hiring seven speech-language pathologists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4076)|
| 1:08:01| four school psychologists, and five vision specialists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4081)|
| 1:08:05| For context, on average each year we typically hire anywhere from 50 to 60 new special ed teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4085)|
| 1:08:12| so this is a significant jump going into the 19-20 school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4092)|
| 1:08:19| So I thought it might be helpful to provide a little context as it relates to the big picture around recruiting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4099)|
| 1:08:25| particularly in the field of education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4105)|
| 1:08:27| So the graph that you can see up there is a study that was conducted by UCLA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4107)|
| 1:08:31| and it looks at college freshmen's interest in the teaching profession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4111)|
| 1:08:35| As you can see over the course of the last 10 years there's been a pretty significant drop-off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4115)|
| 1:08:40| and basically what this is highlighting is that overall the number of students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4120)|
| 1:08:44| who are going into the field has dropped significantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4124)|
| 1:08:47| So from a recruitment standpoint that means the number of teachers we have to select from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4127)|
| 1:08:51| is significantly smaller than it has ever been in our history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4131)|
| 1:08:57| So if we break that down a little further and take a look at high-need instructional areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4137)|
| 1:09:02| what you can see listed here is a study that was done by the Department of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4142)|
| 1:09:06| and published by CNN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4146)|
| 1:09:08| Up top, that very long bar at the top is math, but a very close second up under that is special education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4148)|
| 1:09:14| And this is again looking at nationwide shortages for teachers in these high-need instructional areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4154)|
| 1:09:19| So what we're up against is not unique to our district or our region or our state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4159)|
| 1:09:23| It's definitely a national-level issue that's playing itself out across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4163)|
| 1:09:31| So some more fun facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4171)|
| 1:09:33| 47 states, including the District of Columbia, reported having shortages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4173)|
| 1:09:37| specifically within the special ed teaching field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4177)|
| 1:09:39| And that was last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4179)|
| 1:09:40| Data from this year is not available as of yet, but we believe that number is likely the same if not higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4180)|
| 1:09:46| And also important to note that 51% of all school districts of those schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4186)|
| 1:09:52| 90% of those are high-poverty schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4192)|
| 1:09:54| So you've got schools that are already having trouble recruiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4194)|
| 1:09:58| on top of trying to recruit teachers in a field that we've already experienced a pretty significant shortage in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4198)|
| 1:10:03| So that just kind of compounds the issue of recruiting spec teachers specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4203)|
| 1:10:08| The other important factor here, and I think that's kind of what we're seeing bear out this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4208)|
| 1:10:15| is that special ed teachers leave the profession at almost double the rate of regular ed educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4215)|
| 1:10:21| So in addition to accounting for fewer numbers of folks going into the field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4221)|
| 1:10:25| we also are now having to account for the rate at which people are leaving the field, particularly in this space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4225)|
| 1:10:31| Most cited reasons for turnover are salary and poor working conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4231)|
| 1:10:36| And then unrelated to that is the anticipated shortage for school psychologists is close to 15,000 nationwide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4236)|
| 1:10:43| and that'll be by 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4243)|
| 1:10:45| We're heading into the 19-20 school year, and so that will be next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4245)|
| 1:10:49| So in addition to SPED being an area where we've seen shortages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4249)|
| 1:10:53| they just now have started really beginning to track school psychology as a shortage area as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4253)|
| 1:10:58| and it's pretty significant nationwide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4258)|
| 1:11:03| So here's one of the biggest challenges that we're up against as it relates to the fields of speech pathology, hearing, and audiology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4263)|
| 1:11:10| There are only four universities in the state of Tennessee that offer degree programs and certifications in either of these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4270)|
| 1:11:17| The two universities with asterisks by them currently have no students enrolled in those programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4277)|
| 1:11:21| which means they won't be putting any out or that will be graduating in the course of the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4281)|
| 1:11:28| Who doesn't have any enrolled that will be graduating?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4288)|
| 1:11:32| The University of Tennessee and Tennessee State don't have any that will be graduating in the next two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4292)|
| 1:11:41| So then we've also got closest universities that offer vision programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4301)|
| 1:11:45| There actually are no universities within the state of Tennessee that offer degree-seeking programs in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4305)|
| 1:11:50| So in order to actively recruit these teachers, we are going to have to look beyond what's right here in our backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4310)|
| 1:11:56| What's listed here is what the supervisor staff in student support services have identified as some of the best universities with these programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4316)|
| 1:12:05| These are also those that are likely closest to us in terms of region for recruiting purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4325)|
| 1:12:15| So as we know, Knox County does continue to be one of the lower-paying districts in our region,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4335)|
| 1:12:20| and that makes it exceptionally challenging for us to be competitive when it comes to recruiting the best and the brightest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4340)|
| 1:12:25| but also the best as it relates to fields where there already are very slim or low numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4345)|
| 1:12:31| So the other big thing that we took note of in the process of working on this proposal was taking a look at what some of the other districts across the state are doing in order to address this need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4351)|
| 1:12:41| As I mentioned, it's definitely nationwide, but it's also something that our fellow districts are seeing across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4361)|
| 1:12:46| I'll highlight some of those examples as we kind of walk through the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4366)|
| 1:12:53| So currently what we offer SPED teachers is what we offer to all of our high-need instructional areas, which would be our math, science, world languages, ELL, and SPED.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4373)|
| 1:13:02| They receive a $5,000 signing bonus, which is taxed on that full bonus amount, so it actually comes out to being roughly around $3,200 after tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4382)|
| 1:13:10| Those payments are distributed to educators typically during late October, early November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4390)|
| 1:13:16| and if the teacher leaves within three years of starting with the district, they're required to pay that amount back at a prorated amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4396)|
| 1:13:25| So what we'd like to propose is that for SPED teachers this year, we look at increasing that amount to $7,000 and transitioning it from a bonus to a stipend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4405)|
| 1:13:35| Seemingly nuanced around the language, but a stipend would eliminate that bonus tax that comes off the top of the bonuses that we're currently paying out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4415)|
| 1:13:43| The other thing we'd like to propose is that we transition from using these funds as a bonus structure, but also using them from a retention standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4423)|
| 1:13:52| So instead of paying it out all at one time, we'd like to propose paying it out in an incremental structure over the course of three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4432)|
| 1:14:00| respectively in year one, $3,000, year two, $2,000, and year three, $2,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4440)|
| 1:14:08| So one of the highlighted examples I pulled was from Shelby County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4448)|
| 1:14:12| They also have a similar structure that they're using for SPED teachers as well as their high-need instructional areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4452)|
| 1:14:18| where they pay out $750 at the beginning of the first school year, $750 at the end of the first school year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4458)|
| 1:14:25| and then going into the second year, a third and final stipend is paid out to those teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4465)|
| 1:14:30| So similar structure, just over a shorter period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4470)|
| 1:14:37| So the second piece of this proposal we'd like to present is around incentivizing those areas that we highlighted before as it relates to student support services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4477)|
| 1:14:45| specifically speech-language therapists, school psychologists, hearing specialists, vision specialists, and audiologists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4485)|
| 1:14:52| Currently, we do not have any incentives for folks who are certified in those areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4492)|
| 1:14:56| and so what we'd like to propose is that we add them to the standard $5,000 signing bonus or stipend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4496)|
| 1:15:04| but we'd like to specifically propose that that be offered to them up front, particularly given,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4504)|
| 1:15:11| given again what we know about the proximity of those universities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4511)|
| 1:15:14| we know more than likely if we're going to find folks that can come in and fill those positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4514)|
| 1:15:18| we're going to have to look out of state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4518)|
| 1:15:20| So the thought is that if we're able to offer a $5,000 signing bonus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4520)|
| 1:15:23| that could be leveraged as a relocation support donation or relocation support bonus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4523)|
| 1:15:28| to help further incentivize folks to come from out of state to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4528)|
| 1:15:33| and subsequently relocate to take on positions with our district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4533)|
| 1:15:40| Kind of again an acknowledgement that there are statewide shortages in these field areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4540)|
| 1:15:45| Two examples of what some other districts in our state are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4545)|
| 1:15:48| Elizabethan is offering a 5% increase to the base salary for folks who are in those hard-to-staff areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4548)|
| 1:15:55| specifically speech language and pathology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4555)|
| 1:15:57| Kingsport has also recently adjusted their pay schedule so that they will allow teachers coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4557)|
| 1:16:04| with experience outside of the public education sector to receive those years of credit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4564)|
| 1:16:09| for those years of experience, essentially bumping them up on the pay scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4569)|
| 1:16:13| And then one other final example was in Tullahoma where speech pathologists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4573)|
| 1:16:17| and speech psychologists positions have been added to the district's listing for hard-to-staff positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4577)|
| 1:16:21| and subsequently are eligible for the $5,000 bonus offered by their district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4581)|
| 1:16:28| So the last piece of this is in an effort to incentivize our current teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4588)|
| 1:16:34| who either have an existing certification in SPIN and are currently not using it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4594)|
| 1:16:39| and or who might be interested in adding on a secondary certification in SPIN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4599)|
| 1:16:44| Lipscomb University is offering a very unique program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4604)|
| 1:16:48| It's four courses exclusively online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4608)|
| 1:16:51| It's hosted during the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4611)|
| 1:16:53| I think it runs, I think the final practice date is late June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4613)|
| 1:16:57| so ideally you could have teachers certified and ready to roll by the start of the 19-20 school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4617)|
| 1:17:03| You're only eligible if you currently hold a Tennessee teaching license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4623)|
| 1:17:07| I think there's 25 seats that they run in this program each summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4627)|
| 1:17:10| And so we'd love to look at a process that would allow us to incentivize our current teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4630)|
| 1:17:15| who might be interested in securing a secondary certification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4635)|
| 1:17:18| and taking on a position in a SPED classroom to do so with a little support from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4638)|
| 1:17:26| So the proposal here is we do currently have tuition reimbursement that is available for folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4646)|
| 1:17:34| One of the critiques that we frequently hear is that you've got to have the money in order to pay it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4654)|
| 1:17:38| and then be able to be reimbursed for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4658)|
| 1:17:41| And a lot of our folks simply don't have what it costs to enroll and pay out tuition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4661)|
| 1:17:45| So one of the things we'd like to propose is that we transition this idea around tuition reimbursement to tuition support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4665)|
| 1:17:52| whereas people who are interested in securing the secondary SPED certification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4672)|
| 1:17:57| would have tuition support paid out up front to the university to help them secure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4677)|
| 1:18:01| what only would take the course of one summer to complete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4681)|
| 1:18:04| and have them certified and ready to go by the 19-20 school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4684)|
| 1:18:08| Based on the district's current policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4688)|
| 1:18:10| the tuition support that they would be eligible for wouldn't cover the full amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4690)|
| 1:18:14| but it would cover close to half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4694)|
| 1:18:16| So my thought is that that might help to incentivize people who might not otherwise be interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4696)|
| 1:18:20| in securing the secondary certification to do so without that financial barrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4700)|
| 1:18:24| The other piece of this that we like to also recommend is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4704)|
| 1:18:28| because these folks would be becoming SPED teachers for the first time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4708)|
| 1:18:31| they would subsequently be eligible for that initial $7,000 bonus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4711)|
| 1:18:35| and that would incentivize them to remain in that position over the course of the three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4715)|
| 1:18:44| A good example of this is in Marshall County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4724)|
| 1:18:47| They have agreed to start reimbursing up to $3,000 per fiscal year to any certified person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4727)|
| 1:18:53| obtaining an add-on endorsement in SPED.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4733)|
| 1:18:56| And this is in direct response to that program that Lipscomb has put out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4736)|
| 1:18:59| and is going on, I think, their third year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4739)|
| 1:19:05| Everyone's favorite question, how do we pay for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4745)|
| 1:19:08| Well, we actually already have funds allocated to cover what would fall under these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4748)|
| 1:19:14| As far as tuition reimbursement goes, the current budget allocation is $46,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4754)|
| 1:19:19| and year-to-date spending on that is $0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4759)|
| 1:19:22| For signing bonuses, we currently have $560,000 allocated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4762)|
| 1:19:26| and current year-to-date spending on that is $399,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4766)|
| 1:19:29| So my proposal would be that we do actually have funds already allocated in the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4769)|
| 1:19:33| at least to cover year one of rolling this proposal out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4773)|
| 1:19:39| I'm hoping that's compelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4779)|
| 1:19:40| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4780)|
| 1:19:42| I know that was a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4782)|
| 1:19:45| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4785)|
| 1:19:51| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4791)|
| 1:19:53| Yeah, I just have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4793)|
| 1:19:54| Do you know, for that Lipscomb SPED endorsement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4794)|
| 1:19:58| what the total cost is for them to take the four classes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4798)|
| 1:20:02| I sure do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4802)|
| 1:20:05| So the cost is $477,000 per credit hour, and it's four courses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4805)|
| 1:20:09| It's three hours, so the total is roughly $5,700.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4809)|
| 1:20:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4817)|
| 1:20:18| Ms. Sullivan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4818)|
| 1:20:21| I've talked to several very experienced special ed teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4821)|
| 1:20:25| and when they see this, they want to know, well, what about me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4825)|
| 1:20:28| I've dedicated my life to Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4828)|
| 1:20:32| and there was no sign-on bonus when I came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4832)|
| 1:20:35| Do we have any thoughts on any kind of incentive for folks who have been long-term employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4835)|
| 1:20:42| and who choose to stay for an extended time, maybe if they stay past 15 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4842)|
| 1:20:51| So I'll be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4851)|
| 1:20:53| The primary issue in presenting this proposal is to address the gaping hole that we are anticipating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4853)|
| 1:20:59| 80 to 95 teachers is unprecedented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4859)|
| 1:21:02| We will not be able to find that many people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4862)|
| 1:21:05| They're just simply not being put out at that rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4865)|
| 1:21:08| So the focus here really was specifically on trying to get folks in to fill the vacancies we know that we'll have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4868)|
| 1:21:14| but certainly some additional thought I agree does need to be given to how do we continue to retain the talent that we do have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4874)|
| 1:21:22| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4882)|
| 1:21:23| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4883)|
| 1:21:24| The funds that are available, was that to cover all of the initiatives?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4884)|
| 1:21:32| Do you think the funds that you have left over will cover all of the initiatives, or was that just the third one, the final one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4892)|
| 1:21:39| They should definitely be able to get us covered for year one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4899)|
| 1:21:42| We're working with the Finance Department now to project out what the full three-year cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4902)|
| 1:21:48| because again, for that first initiative piece, that's a three-year payout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4908)|
| 1:21:52| so we'd have to look at what that looks like over the course of the two to three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4912)|
| 1:21:55| But in terms of what's already been allocated for this fiscal year, there are funds in order to go ahead and get this started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4915)|
| 1:22:00| And the primary pressing issue is that recruitment season has started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4920)|
| 1:22:03| My first year is tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4923)|
| 1:22:05| So if this is an initiative that we're going to roll out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4925)|
| 1:22:08| we definitely want to make sure that we're doing so in a way that allows us to maximize what's left of recruitment season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4928)|
| 1:22:14| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4934)|
| 1:22:20| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4940)|
| 1:22:22| I guess what I would say from this is that I can see Ms. Owens' point, how discouraging it would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4942)|
| 1:22:29| because it's very tough work for those people that have given their entire careers to working in special ed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4949)|
| 1:22:38| But I do appreciate you putting all this together and all the different ways that you're trying to address it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4958)|
| 1:22:46| particularly the proposed incentive for staying on for a certain number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4966)|
| 1:22:54| But I would like to see, and I can support this initiative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4974)|
| 1:22:57| I would like to see, however, that we address the working conditions as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4977)|
| 1:23:02| because I think just to address the financial part of it may help on the front end to get those people into our system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4982)|
| 1:23:12| But we will not keep them here if we don't address the toughness that happens within those classrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4992)|
| 1:23:19| and the working conditions that those people endure day in and day out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=4999)|
| 1:23:23| So that would be my thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5003)|
| 1:23:25| Thank you, Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5005)|
| 1:23:26| Ms. Hatterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5006)|
| 1:23:27| If we can go back to the slide with the $7,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5007)|
| 1:23:31| And it's just a clarification that I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5011)|
| 1:23:37| I don't. Keep scrolling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5017)|
| 1:23:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5018)|
| 1:23:40| Yeah, right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5020)|
| 1:23:41| So could you give some, let me know the rationale behind the number $7,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5021)|
| 1:23:48| as well as the rationale with splitting it 3-2-2 versus any other order?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5028)|
| 1:23:54| So no necessary rationale around the 3-2-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5034)|
| 1:23:58| The thought there is, one, again, because people know what our historical background is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5038)|
| 1:24:03| they know that that upfront $5,000 signing bonus has always been available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5043)|
| 1:24:07| One, upping that number is part of it to differentiate and to elevate this above the other areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5047)|
| 1:24:13| where we're currently offering a signing bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5053)|
| 1:24:16| Two, the other big piece of this was around eliminating that bonus tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5056)|
| 1:24:19| So we were telling people, you get a $5,000 signing bonus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5059)|
| 1:24:22| but when everyone gets those checks in October and November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5062)|
| 1:24:25| you get a $5,000 bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5065)|
| 1:24:27| So we were telling people, you get a $5,000 signing bonus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5067)|
| 1:24:29| but when everyone gets those checks in October and November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5069)|
| 1:24:32| and it's been taxed at that full amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5072)|
| 1:24:34| and they realize, oh, it's actually closer to $3,200,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5074)|
| 1:24:37| that was a question that we got pretty frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5077)|
| 1:24:40| So the other piece of syping a room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5080)|
| 1:24:43| The other piece of building it out as an incremental pay structure was around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5083)|
| 1:24:47| one, trying to eliminate the hit that folks were taking off of that $5,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5087)|
| 1:24:51| because it was being taxed at a bonus rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5091)|
| 1:24:53| And by distributing it out over the course of the three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5093)|
| 1:24:56| it's not taxed on that full bulk amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5096)|
| 1:24:58| So they actually get more of what's being paid out, essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5098)|
| 1:25:03| Does that address your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5103)|
| 1:25:05| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5105)|
| 1:25:06| Yeah, it does, especially with there not being a concrete rationale with the $3,200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5106)|
| 1:25:11| I just, when I've seen it, I think it's more of a carrot for to get the $3,000 the third year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5111)|
| 1:25:17| just so we can keep them there for that long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5117)|
| 1:25:20| And that's just me just looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5120)|
| 1:25:22| I have no evidence behind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5122)|
| 1:25:26| Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5126)|
| 1:25:28| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5128)|
| 1:25:30| As to the point about working conditions, it's my suspicion that that's a much bigger issue than the monetary one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5130)|
| 1:25:40| But that's just from, you know, calls that I've gotten and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5140)|
| 1:25:46| So my question is, do we have policies within our system that address working conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5146)|
| 1:25:56| such as protections for special ed teachers in situations that put them in harm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5156)|
| 1:26:06| or put them in, you know, say, a bathroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5166)|
| 1:26:13| A female has to take a male to a bathroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5173)|
| 1:26:19| Do we have policies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5179)|
| 1:26:21| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5181)|
| 1:26:23| Yes, sir, Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5183)|
| 1:26:24| We do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5184)|
| 1:26:25| We follow the same kind of protocol in all of our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5185)|
| 1:26:28| Two staff are always required when we're assisting in a restroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5188)|
| 1:26:32| whether that just be that we're there to make sure the child has stability issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5192)|
| 1:26:37| But we always have two staff people present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5197)|
| 1:26:40| That's a policy statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5200)|
| 1:26:42| We have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5202)|
| 1:26:43| In the bathroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5203)|
| 1:26:44| It's our practice, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5204)|
| 1:26:45| It's a practice or it's a policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5205)|
| 1:26:47| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5207)|
| 1:26:48| We train all of our staff on how to help us assist the student in the restroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5208)|
| 1:26:54| It's part of the training protocol that our OT and PT department utilize when they train staff to assist in restrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5214)|
| 1:27:01| So it is written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5221)|
| 1:27:03| It's not in our board policy, but it's written in the practices that we do in our special education department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5223)|
| 1:27:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5229)|
| 1:27:10| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5230)|
| 1:27:14| I did want to clarify one point because I think that we, when we're, I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5234)|
| 1:27:20| the slide about the University of Tennessee Speech Language Program, they do have students enrolled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5240)|
| 1:27:25| It's the audiology and vision that we really are challenged with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5245)|
| 1:27:29| There's not programs that are meeting the needs close by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5249)|
| 1:27:33| The challenge for our speech language, and I know that because I teach a class for them every semester,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5253)|
| 1:27:39| is that we are not as competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5259)|
| 1:27:41| I mean, they can go into the private sector and the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5261)|
| 1:27:44| So having that incentive for them is really important as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5264)|
| 1:27:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5269)|
| 1:27:50| Ms. Bath?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5270)|
| 1:27:51| I do have a question on the recruitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5271)|
| 1:27:53| I mean, I just personally know so many of my teacher friends who have gotten out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5273)|
| 1:27:57| Not because of working conditions or anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5277)|
| 1:27:59| It's them starting families and staying home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5279)|
| 1:28:01| Do we do anything about keeping a database of some of those people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5281)|
| 1:28:04| and at this point going back to some of these people that have left us, trying to recruit them back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5284)|
| 1:28:11| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5291)|
| 1:28:12| We actually talk to folks about job share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5292)|
| 1:28:15| We deal with anybody that we know that is not currently working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5295)|
| 1:28:18| We'll reach out to do short-term fill-ins for pregnancy leaves or for other types of medical leaves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5298)|
| 1:28:24| So we stay in contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5304)|
| 1:28:31| Ms. Drennan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5311)|
| 1:28:38| Sorry, I'm trying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5318)|
| 1:28:39| I'm trying here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5319)|
| 1:28:40| No, I'm good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5320)|
| 1:28:41| Me too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5321)|
| 1:28:46| Has any consideration been or have numbers been run on perhaps adding these teachers to the supplement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5326)|
| 1:28:56| All special education teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5336)|
| 1:28:58| Well, since that's a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5338)|
| 1:28:59| I mean, we have not run the numbers specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5339)|
| 1:29:01| Have we talked about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5341)|
| 1:29:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5343)|
| 1:29:04| And I'm trying to remember what year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5344)|
| 1:29:06| Rodney Russell did all of those listening sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5346)|
| 1:29:08| Ms. Coates may be able to help me with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5348)|
| 1:29:11| But every single one of those groups, and those were all, you know, groups of teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5351)|
| 1:29:15| every single teacher group came back with a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5355)|
| 1:29:18| It was the differentiated pay discussions that he had across the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5358)|
| 1:29:22| One of the number one recommendations, other than, of course, teacher raises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5362)|
| 1:29:25| was that there should be a supplement for special education teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5365)|
| 1:29:29| Unanimously, every group he worked with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5369)|
| 1:29:31| So that's been an ongoing discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5371)|
| 1:29:33| It's just been that the budget really hasn't lended itself to that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5373)|
| 1:29:38| Now, our psychologists get a supplement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5378)|
| 1:29:40| The psychologists do have a supplement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5380)|
| 1:29:42| Do our speech and language?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5382)|
| 1:29:43| Our speech and language also have the LSL.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5383)|
| 1:29:45| And do our vision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5385)|
| 1:29:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5386)|
| 1:29:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5387)|
| 1:29:52| Again, I don't know what those numbers would look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5392)|
| 1:29:54| but my thought in possibly looking at that is that even with these stipends and these signing bonuses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5394)|
| 1:30:03| it's kind of almost a one-shot deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5403)|
| 1:30:06| And even the $7,000 stipend, it's like you risk making less money the fourth year than you would the third year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5406)|
| 1:30:14| or it would be a break-even kind of thing, whereas a salary supplement at least keeps building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5414)|
| 1:30:22| So just a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5422)|
| 1:30:24| But I like the work that you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5424)|
| 1:30:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5426)|
| 1:30:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5427)|
| 1:30:28| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5428)|
| 1:30:30| Just to clarify for the Board the difference in those numbers on a per-check basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5430)|
| 1:30:37| which is an easier way to look at it I think for some of our employees, looking at a $5,000 bonus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5437)|
| 1:30:44| which is really a $3,200 bonus, I did it that way and took that $3,200| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5444)|
| 1:30:49| and divided it by three years and by 12 checks, and that comes out to just under $89 a check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5449)|
| 1:30:57| Taking the $2,000 and dividing it by 12 checks in one year, so that was the $7,000 option there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5457)|
| 1:31:07| at $2,000 divided by 12 it would be $167 per check, and the $3,000 a year would come out to $250 per check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5467)|
| 1:31:16| So it's significantly different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5476)|
| 1:31:21| There's still some tax to that, isn't there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5481)|
| 1:31:23| You were just saying it wasn't taxed as much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5483)|
| 1:31:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5485)|
| 1:31:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5491)|
| 1:31:32| So if the Board ultimately approves this, are you going to be able to find them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5492)|
| 1:31:39| Even with this starting tomorrow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5499)|
| 1:31:43| And yes, that's definitely my hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5503)|
| 1:31:45| I think this would at least get us in the game, because I'll be frank, right now we don't stand a fighting chance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5505)|
| 1:31:51| at least not for the schools that are in our region,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5511)|
| 1:31:53| and those are typically going to be our best shots in securing folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5513)|
| 1:31:59| So this would definitely be, I think, a game changer, particularly in some of those student support services areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5519)|
| 1:32:04| because we are going to have to look out, we are going to have to be more creative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5524)|
| 1:32:09| and it's always a little easier if you've got something that feels like it's an enticing treat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5529)|
| 1:32:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5537)|
| 1:32:18| Ms. Horn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5538)|
| 1:32:19| I guess I was just going to say, of course, this is handicapping you, because you're just bringing it to us now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5539)|
| 1:32:23| and you have recruitment fairs tomorrow, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5543)|
| 1:32:26| So is there a suggestion from staff as to how we deal with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5546)|
| 1:32:38| I was going to say, we would love to be able to start tomorrow, but we know that that requires the vote of the Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5558)|
| 1:32:43| That is her first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5563)|
| 1:32:44| There are several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5564)|
| 1:32:46| We know the importance of the recruiting trips she's taking further away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5566)|
| 1:32:50| because we've checked around our local colleges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5570)|
| 1:32:52| The University of Tennessee has 12 graduates, and we're having a luncheon for the folks that are local,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5572)|
| 1:32:57| and going to kind of try to woo them our way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5577)|
| 1:33:01| And we have about 20 that are coming out of Carson-Newman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5581)|
| 1:33:04| So those, again, and we know that some of those people are going to go back home to wherever home is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5584)|
| 1:33:10| So we want to make sure that she has the tools when she's out to try to bring people to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5590)|
| 1:33:16| I was just going to add, too, from the standpoint of the services, we're going to have to provide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5596)|
| 1:33:22| we, by law, have to provide the services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5602)|
| 1:33:24| So we can either do it by our own employees, or we can pay somebody else to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5604)|
| 1:33:29| And I think that's the more expensive option is to pay somebody else to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5609)|
| 1:33:35| In terms of the dollars, we feel like, at this point, to be sure I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5615)|
| 1:33:41| we have the dollars for this year's, the future years that are in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5621)|
| 1:33:46| And I'm not sure, again, I know Mr. Schneider is going to do a budget presentation for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5626)|
| 1:33:53| I don't know that any numbers have been built in for that at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5633)|
| 1:33:58| So, yeah, I'd like to start tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5638)|
| 1:34:00| But maybe we just need to bring that back to the Board as part of the budget that, hey, here's what the future costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5640)|
| 1:34:08| I don't want us to make an obligation to somebody to come and then us not being able to fulfill that obligation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5648)|
| 1:34:14| So, again, I guess we'd like to look at those numbers, too, before we get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5654)|
| 1:34:19| But, yeah, I think it's important that we get started soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5659)|
| 1:34:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5663)|
| 1:34:24| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5664)|
| 1:34:25| I guess my question would be, if you have the funding to cover it within your budget right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5665)|
| 1:34:30| do we need to approve it at this point for this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5670)|
| 1:34:34| I guess the question would then become the year two and year three stipend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5674)|
| 1:34:40| So, but you have the money to cover it this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5680)|
| 1:34:44| So I guess that's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5684)|
| 1:34:46| Would, technically, would it need approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5686)|
| 1:34:52| Well, my answer, I guess, is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5692)|
| 1:34:54| If we're going to be expending these funds, Board approval to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5694)|
| 1:34:59| then that way we know that you're supportive of us moving in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5699)|
| 1:35:06| And I will note that at the district-wide recruitment fair last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5706)|
| 1:35:09| we rolled out a newer initiative where we did lots of on-site interviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5709)|
| 1:35:14| SPED, I think, has always done them at that event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5714)|
| 1:35:17| But because we promoted that and we added some online registration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5717)|
| 1:35:21| we did a lot more last year to hype that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5721)|
| 1:35:23| So I think that was a far more fruitful opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5723)|
| 1:35:25| So ideally, best and worst-case scenarios,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5725)|
| 1:35:28| if we could have something defined and definitive in place by then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5728)|
| 1:35:31| I think that would definitely be probably one of our best shots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5731)|
| 1:35:34| The recruitment fair, typically March 2nd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5734)|
| 1:35:36| is our last big shot at locking down the folks you really want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5736)|
| 1:35:42| Because after that, it's fair game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5742)|
| 1:35:44| It's an open marketplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5744)|
| 1:35:45| And so if we can secure those folks that day and get them signed up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5745)|
| 1:35:48| then I think that would probably help us out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5748)|
| 1:35:50| help us reach that 80 to 90 number a little sooner rather than later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190130?start=5750)|
