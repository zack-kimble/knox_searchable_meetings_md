| 0:06:31| as we break ground on improvements at Augusta Quarry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=391)|
| 0:06:34| This year, we are investing $3.6 million to add restrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=394)|
| 0:06:38| an expanded overlook, an improved pedestrian path,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=398)|

| 0:06:49| to take advantage of the many other boat launches and swimming areas nearby,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=409)|

| 0:07:07| Those who wish to speak either to a specific agenda item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=427)|
| 0:07:10| or during public forum should have already signed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=430)|
| 0:07:13| with Mr. Johnson, the city recorder, ahead of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=433)|
| 0:07:16| Council rules state that up to three people each may speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=436)|
| 0:07:19| for or against an agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=439)|
| 0:07:22| Right now, Item 11A has more than the allowed number of speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=442)|
| 0:07:28| So I have, let's see, I have more than three speakers signed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=448)|
| 0:07:33| to speak in favor of Item 11A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=453)|
| 0:07:38| Is this all of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=458)|
| 0:07:39| How many total?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=459)|
| 0:07:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=461)|
| 0:07:42| So there's six people signed up to speak against it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=462)|
| 0:07:45| and ten in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=465)|
| 0:07:48| Are these the ones that came first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=468)|
| 0:07:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=470)|
| 0:07:51| So unless otherwise indicated, I will just be calling on the first three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=471)|
| 0:07:56| who signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=476)|
| 0:07:57| So if you had someone other than those first three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=477)|
| 0:08:00| please confer and huddle in the back and find your three speakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=480)|
| 0:08:06| before we get to Item 11A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=486)|
| 0:08:11| For all speakers, please do not use profanity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=491)|
| 0:08:14| And when speaking to specific agenda items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=494)|
| 0:08:16| please remember to stay on topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=496)|
| 0:08:19| Those who fail to adhere to those rules may be ruled out of order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=499)|
| 0:08:22| and asked to step away from the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=502)|
| 0:08:24| For those who are listening, please note,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=504)|
| 0:08:27| you may not disrupt a public meeting from the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=507)|
| 0:08:30| Those who do may be asked to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=510)|
| 0:08:33| I'm going to repeat that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=513)|
| 0:08:34| For those who are listening, please note,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=514)|

| 0:08:40| Thank you in advance for everyone's respect for these rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=520)|
| 0:08:43| And that concludes my Mayor's Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=523)|
| 0:08:46| Are there any reports from Councilmembers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=526)|

| 0:13:52| Most of you all know me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=832)|
| 0:13:54| I'm no stranger to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=834)|
| 0:13:56| I was born and raised here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=836)|
| 0:13:58| I went to – I graduated as a valedictorian from a local Knox County school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=838)|
| 0:14:04| I served on the school board as a student rep with Mayor Kincannon and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=844)|
| 0:14:09| I graduated cum laude from the University of Tennessee here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=849)|
| 0:14:14| My education has taught me to uphold values of liberty and justice and peace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=854)|
| 0:14:18| My education has taught me not only about awful wars that have happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=858)|
| 0:14:21| throughout history but the things that we can learn from them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=861)|
| 0:14:24| that if a group of people in another country can be convicted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=864)|
| 0:14:28| can be convinced that mass murdering civilians is the only solution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=868)|
| 0:14:33| then so too can we, and we must do everything in our power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=873)|
| 0:14:36| to stop that from happening again, to keep from falling into that trap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=876)|
| 0:14:40| I would love to focus on local issues. I really would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=880)|
| 0:14:43| But unfortunately, this has turned into a Knoxville issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| This is the state that produced the unconstitutional anti-Sharia bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=887)|
| 0:14:51| that produced Robert Doggart, who was convicted, a congressional candidate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=891)|
| 0:14:56| who planned to carry out an armed attack on a massive Muslim community in New York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=896)|
| 0:15:00| This is the state where Representative Ogles, when asked about the massive civilian death toll,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=900)|
| 0:15:04| said, I think we should kill them all, where Congressman Fleischman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=904)|
| 0:15:09| when he realized he was being asked a question by a Palestinian, said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=909)|
| 0:15:12| I will never support you. I will tell you to your face, goodbye to Palestine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=912)|
| 0:15:16| And this is the city where our mayor took a trip to Israel, toured illegal settlements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=916)|
| 0:15:22| met with occupation forces in an effort to build political and social ties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=922)|
| 0:15:27| between the city of Knoxville and the state of Israel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=927)|
| 0:15:29| A mayor who on multiple occasions has said that Knoxville stands with Israel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=929)|
| 0:15:33| This is an issue that concerns...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=933)|
| 0:15:35| Can you please pause the time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=935)|
| 0:15:39| Please let the speaker speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=939)|
| 0:15:41| So forgive us for concerning ourselves with an issue happening around the world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=941)|
| 0:15:47| and forgive us for needing some assurances from all of you that you actually care about our lives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=947)|
| 0:15:52| and that you value the rights of Palestinians and Muslims and civilians in any conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=952)|
| 0:15:57| The UN just released a statement that 1.1 million men, women and children in Gaza| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=957)|
| 0:16:03| are in immediate danger of dying from starvation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=963)|

| 0:16:23| is unprecedented in this century.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=983)|
| 0:16:26| I'm going to ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=986)|
| 0:16:28| Do you know what is the average age of the 35,000 people killed in Gaza in the last six months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=988)|
| 0:16:37| Do you know the average age?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=997)|
| 0:16:39| Let's take a guess. Was it 25? Maybe 18?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=999)|
| 0:16:42| Let's take a wild guess. Maybe 15 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1002)|
| 0:16:45| The average age of the 35,000 people killed by the Israeli military in the last six months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1005)|
| 0:16:51| is five years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1011)|
| 0:16:53| Five years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1016)|
| 0:17:00| I'm going to be clear with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| And let's make this clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1022)|
| 0:17:05| This resolution does not call for supporting Hamas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1025)|
| 0:17:09| It's not calling you to make a statement on Hamas or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1029)|
| 0:17:14| It's asking you to please show us that you uphold the value of civilian lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1034)|
| 0:17:19| That you care about the fact that our government is complicit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1039)|
| 0:17:23| and not only complicit, but supporting the murder of so many people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1043)|
| 0:17:28| hospitals and schools and homes that have been razed to the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1048)|

| 0:17:36| the America that I would love to be proud of and to tell my family that I'm so proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1056)|
| 0:17:42| And the last thing I'll share is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1062)|
| 0:17:45| To the Knoxville Jewish Alliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1065)|
| 0:17:47| I'm extending an invitation to you all to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1067)|
| 0:17:50| and cordially discuss this issue with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1070)|
| 0:17:53| You don't need to spend thousands of dollars flying some random Palestinian dude| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1073)|
| 0:17:57| who has really iffy and wishy-washy weird views| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| to come speak in Knoxville and educate us about issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| that we've witnessed with our own eyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1083)|

| 0:18:47| and then we'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1127)|
| 0:18:49| Hi. My name is Rikki Draper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1129)|
| 0:18:51| I'm a resident of Knoxville 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1131)|
| 0:18:55| I'm here as a representative of the Knoxville chapter of Jewish Voice for Peace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1135)|
| 0:19:01| an organization representing Jews across the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1141)|

| 0:19:09| I'm in coalition with the many people here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1149)|

| 0:19:23| I am the descendant of people who have survived genocide, displacement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1163)|
| 0:19:29| ethnic cleansing, and persecution because of who they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1169)|
| 0:19:32| I know the price of silence, and I refuse to be silent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1172)|
| 0:19:38| Never again means never again for anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1178)|
| 0:19:42| Never again includes Palestinians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1182)|
| 0:19:45| Never again is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1185)|
| 0:19:48| Councilmember Smith, you and others have said that this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1188)|
| 0:19:53| is sowing division in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1193)|
| 0:19:56| I need you to know that I've never felt more united than I do now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1196)|
| 0:20:02| with the Muslim community of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| with Christian congregations standing for justice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1205)|
| 0:20:08| with my Jewish community demanding that we stop the violence in Gaza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1208)|
| 0:20:14| I've never felt more moral clarity or unity with my Knoxville neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1214)|
| 0:20:20| than I do in this moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1220)|
| 0:20:23| Let's talk about what is actually sowing division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1223)|
| 0:20:26| What is sowing division is the rhetoric of our leadership locally, nationally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1226)|
| 0:20:31| and internationally that links anti-Zionism to anti-Semitism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1231)|
| 0:20:36| which casts suspicion on our Muslim and Palestinian friends and neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1236)|
| 0:20:40| who just want to see their families safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1240)|
| 0:20:44| This rhetoric mistakenly terms our desire for an end to genocide as hate speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1244)|
| 0:20:50| It has led to Jews like us in Knoxville being labeled as anti-Semitic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1250)|
| 0:20:56| as not real Jews, quoted for speaking out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1256)|
| 0:21:00| I'm here to tell you that we are Jewish, we are real,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1260)|
| 0:21:04| and we are asking you to pass this resolution alongside many hundreds in our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1264)|
| 0:21:10| and thousands across the country who have passed similar resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1270)|
| 0:21:18| It's true, there is division in this Jewish community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1278)|
| 0:21:22| The Knoxville Jewish Alliance is a political body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1282)|
| 0:21:24| and represents a part of the Jewish Knoxville community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1284)|
| 0:21:28| We represent another, and it is only growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1288)|
| 0:21:32| We urge you to understand that the Jewish community in Knoxville is not a monolith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1292)|
| 0:21:37| and many of us feel that actions taken by Israel are bad for the Jewish community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1297)|
| 0:21:42| here and everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1302)|
| 0:21:45| They link our identity and heritage, our safety, to genocide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1305)|
| 0:21:52| As long as there have been Zionist Jews, there have been Jews like us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1312)|
| 0:21:56| who oppose violence and apartheid in all forms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1316)|
| 0:22:02| What is actually sowing division in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| is mass starvation and bombing of refugee camps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1325)|
| 0:22:09| What is sowing division is the everyday violations of international law in Gaza| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1329)|
| 0:22:15| by the Israeli state, the invasion of hospitals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1335)|
| 0:22:19| the targeting of journalists, the killing of children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1339)|
| 0:22:25| What is sowing division is the seeming indifference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1345)|
| 0:22:29| or support for the atrocities of our leaders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1349)|

| 0:22:36| is to stop the violence and denounce genocide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1356)|
| 0:22:41| During the temporary ceasefire, over 100 hostages were released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1361)|

| 0:23:12| by passing this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1392)|
| 0:23:14| Generations, I promise you, will look back on this moment and ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1394)|
| 0:23:21| what did you do while Gazan children starved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1401)|
| 0:23:26| What did you do while the Israeli army bombed refugee camps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1406)|
| 0:23:31| The path towards unity, the path towards safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1411)|

| 0:24:04| Kent Minow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1444)|
| 0:24:09| Hello, members of the City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1449)|
| 0:24:11| My name is Arlene Amirante, and I live in Sequoia Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1451)|
| 0:24:15| which falls under District 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1455)|
| 0:24:17| I am an attorney, an educator, the daughter of Mexican immigrants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1457)|
| 0:24:22| and I am here to grieve and to explain why I still have hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1462)|
| 0:24:27| in the face of this relentless tragedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1467)|
| 0:24:30| The last time I was in these chambers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1470)|
| 0:24:32| I came to support a ceasefire resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1472)|
| 0:24:34| and I am frankly still trying to piece together what went wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1474)|
| 0:24:38| How could it be possible that the city's elected representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1478)|
| 0:24:41| heard what I heard and then did nothing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1481)|
| 0:24:45| I read the language of the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1485)|
| 0:24:47| and could not locate the source of the controversy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1487)|
| 0:24:51| But then it dawned on me that we do not view the world in the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1491)|
| 0:24:55| Where I saw pain and grief, you saw tactics and maneuverings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1495)|
| 0:25:00| Where I heard pleas for recognition, you heard noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1500)|
| 0:25:04| You behaved as though Muslims and Jews just hate each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1504)|
| 0:25:07| and that's a fact of life, and that it would be best if you did not engage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1507)|
| 0:25:11| But inaction is a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1511)|
| 0:25:15| I recognize that your initial instinct has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1515)|
| 0:25:20| and probably will still be to reject any formal discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1520)|
| 0:25:24| about these atrocities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1524)|
| 0:25:26| But because we co-create our narratives as a society,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1526)|
| 0:25:32| it is imperative that you do not remain silent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1532)|
| 0:25:35| as you did on November 28th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1535)|
| 0:25:37| on the question of whether Israel should do more to protect innocent lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1537)|
| 0:25:42| The answer to this question should not be difficult,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1542)|
| 0:25:45| and your silence, again, was an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1545)|
| 0:25:49| To remain silent as an American is to tacitly condone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1549)|
| 0:25:53| what we are all witnessing in Gaza,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1553)|
| 0:25:55| the deliberate starvation and corralling of human beings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1555)|
| 0:25:59| into increasingly small swaths of land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1559)|
| 0:26:02| facilitating their mass extermination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1562)|
| 0:26:04| with the weapons that our country has provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1564)|
| 0:26:10| When we had the first city council meeting on the 28th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1570)|
| 0:26:13| the general consensus was that Israel would not continue its bombardment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1573)|
| 0:26:17| until the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| And I suppose that we all gave ourselves the hope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1579)|
| 0:26:23| the freedom to imagine that it would be over soon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1583)|
| 0:26:26| but that did not happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1586)|
| 0:26:28| And since then, Israel has wantonly murdered everything in its path| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1588)|
| 0:26:32| without distinction or remorse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1592)|
| 0:26:35| Medics, time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1595)|
| 0:26:39| These are facts. You can look them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1599)|
| 0:26:42| I have a website if you would like to catalog it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| It's at www.adelantemos.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1604)|
| 0:26:51| And these sources, by the way, are from the UN,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1611)|
| 0:26:55| which I hope you trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1615)|
| 0:27:00| Well, at this time, I would like to remind us that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1620)|
| 0:27:05| medics, journalists, children, Israeli hostages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1625)|
| 0:27:09| mothers and fathers have been tormented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1629)|
| 0:27:13| as we all watch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| Yesterday, the Wall Street Journal published an article| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1636)|
| 0:27:19| warning that over one million Gazans are estimated to be starving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1639)|
| 0:27:23| On top of that, Israel is threatening a full-scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| or forcibly remove 1.9 million Palestinians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1646)|
| 0:27:31| sheltering there directly against the ICJ's orders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1651)|
| 0:27:34| which, as you know, because I'm sure you read through the pages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1654)|
| 0:27:37| that are submitted in the document, the agenda today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1657)|
| 0:27:41| I mourn for the invisibility and the dehumanization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1661)|
| 0:27:52| of my Palestinian brothers and sisters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1672)|
| 0:27:55| I mourn for what we could be and cannot be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1675)|
| 0:27:58| until we are allowed to mourn and grieve together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1678)|
| 0:28:01| in the face of such devastation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| I ask you members of the City Council to mourn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1683)|
| 0:28:06| with a community in pain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| We may not be able to stop the war in Gaza,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1688)|
| 0:28:11| but at least you here in this room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1691)|
| 0:28:15| can tell your neighbors that they matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1695)|
| 0:28:18| that their pain matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1698)|
| 0:28:21| And this resolution means nothing more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1701)|
| 0:28:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1704)|
| 0:28:26| applause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1706)|
| 0:28:32| Okay, now we're moving to the three speakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1712)|
| 0:28:35| signed up to speak against Item 11A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1715)|
| 0:28:39| First person is Scott Jacobson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1719)|
| 0:28:42| Scott Jacobson, are you present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1722)|
| 0:28:45| Okay, if you could come to the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1725)|
| 0:28:48| state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1728)|
| 0:28:50| and you'll have up to five minutes to address Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1730)|
| 0:28:57| Scott Jacobson, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1737)|
| 0:29:04| What is happening in Gaza right now is horrific and a tragedy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1744)|
| 0:29:08| but every ounce of blood that is being spilled is on Hamas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1748)|
| 0:29:11| Hamas initiated this conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| There was a ceasefire all the way up to October 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1754)|
| 0:29:17| On October 7, they stormed into Israel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1757)|
| 0:29:20| killing over 1,200 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| and taking over 200 hostages back into Gaza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1762)|
| 0:29:25| Hamas then planted themselves in terror tunnels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1765)|
| 0:29:28| they spent billions of dollars building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| that they robbed from their own civilian population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1770)|
| 0:29:33| Hamas is unequivocally recognized as a terrorist organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1773)|
| 0:29:36| by the United States, Canada, the European Union,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1776)|
| 0:29:39| Australia, Japan, the U.K., New Zealand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1779)|
| 0:29:42| and numerous other nations and international bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1782)|
| 0:29:45| Their charter outright rejects any possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1785)|
| 0:29:48| of negotiated peace settlements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1788)|
| 0:29:50| advocates for the destruction of Israel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| calls for jihad, and fosters anti-Semitic incitement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1792)|
| 0:29:56| Numerous interviews with Hamas leaders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| have reaffirmed their intent to perpetrate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1798)|
| 0:30:00| the atrocities of October 7 again and again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1800)|
| 0:30:04| U.S. intelligence agencies, along with those of France, Italy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1804)|
| 0:30:07| NATO, and the U.N., confirm Hamas' use of human shields| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1807)|
| 0:30:10| to exploit Israel's efforts to minimize civilian casualties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1810)|
| 0:30:14| and capitalize on Western sensitivities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| towards noncombatant deaths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1816)|
| 0:30:19| They've even shamelessly filmed their abhorrent acts of violence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1819)|
| 0:30:22| including the murder of babies, rape, and mutilation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1822)|
| 0:30:27| We are living in a time where the devil does not even hide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1827)|
| 0:30:30| Just wait just a minute while we try to close the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1830)|
| 0:30:35| Okay, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1835)|
| 0:30:37| We are living in a time where the devil does not even hide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1837)|
| 0:30:40| and the world still cannot see him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1840)|
| 0:30:43| For the people demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| because too many civilians have died, I ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1846)|
| 0:30:49| If too many civilians have died,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1849)|
| 0:30:51| how many civilian deaths would have been an acceptable number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1851)|
| 0:30:55| The reality is that no civilian deaths are ever acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1855)|
| 0:30:59| But the reality is also that passivism leads to the deaths of civilians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1859)|
| 0:31:04| as aggressors realize they can murder with impunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| Likewise, if the use of human shields| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1867)|
| 0:31:10| ends military operations completely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1870)|
| 0:31:12| the outcome will be an increase of aggression using human shields| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1872)|
| 0:31:16| and therefore more civilian deaths on the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1876)|
| 0:31:19| In other words, passivism is as bloody as war.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1879)|
| 0:31:24| Hamas has put Israel in a no-win situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1884)|
| 0:31:27| There is no way out in which more innocent civilians do not die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1887)|
| 0:31:32| The Jewish state can only choose to limit those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1892)|
| 0:31:34| through careful attacks with warnings and other precautions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1894)|
| 0:31:37| or simply sit back and wait for the deaths of its own citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| when attacked by an enemy that shows no mercy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| Connell John Spencer, Chair of Urban Warfare Studies at West Point said...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1903)|
| 0:31:48| Yeah, just pause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1908)|
| 0:31:52| We'll just pause the clock until the door is closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1912)|
| 0:31:57| PBA...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1917)|
| 0:32:02| PBA...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1922)|
| 0:32:08| Can you close the door, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1928)|
| 0:32:15| Louder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1935)|
| 0:32:16| Okay, I think it's quiet enough. We can hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1939)|
| 0:32:20| Connell John Spencer, Chair of Urban Warfare Studies at West Point said...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1940)|
| 0:32:24| Israel has taken more steps to avoid harming civilians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1944)|
| 0:32:27| than any other military in history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1947)|
| 0:32:30| You cannot say you support Israel's right to exist and defend itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1950)|
| 0:32:34| and then oppose Israel when it exercises that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1954)|
| 0:32:38| Hamas has governed Gaza since 2007| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| and has received more than $7 billion of aid from the United States| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1961)|
| 0:32:45| according to government documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| Where did the money go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1967)|
| 0:32:49| Well, approximately 10% of the budget goes to the Martyr Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1969)|
| 0:32:53| This fund pays the monthly income to every Palestinian in their family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1973)|
| 0:32:57| who commits a terrorist act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1977)|
| 0:32:59| The more Jews they kill, the more Hamas pays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1979)|
| 0:33:03| If Palestinians can stay alive by simply not killing Israelis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1983)|
| 0:33:07| then they are probably not facing a genocide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1987)|
| 0:33:10| If the Israelis have the ability to stay alive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| only because of their tremendous defense systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| they are the ones facing a genocide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1996)|
| 0:33:19| Stop asking Israel to agree to a ceasefire Hamas will not honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=1999)|
| 0:33:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2006)|
| 0:33:32| The next...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2012)|
| 0:33:36| Please, we're ready for the next speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2016)|
| 0:33:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| The next person speaking against Item 11A is Larry Markle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2023)|
| 0:33:48| Mr. Markle, if you could start by saying your name and address for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2028)|
| 0:33:51| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| Larry Markle, I'm a member of Temple Beth-El.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| I live in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| The speakers in favor of the resolution eloquently expressed their pain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2037)|
| 0:34:01| their sorrow, their horror, their grief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| and I do not mean to invalidate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2044)|
| 0:34:07| The situation in Israel in Gaza is ghastly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2047)|
| 0:34:10| but this resolution will not help the Palestinians in Gaza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2050)|
| 0:34:14| Hamas's strategy was to commit atrocities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| that would provoke a massive response from Israel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2057)|
| 0:34:20| in order to mobilize world opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2060)|
| 0:34:22| That is why their October 7th terrorist attack| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2062)|
| 0:34:25| was characterized by such gratuitous cruelty, brutality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2065)|
| 0:34:28| rape, mutilation, and murder of innocents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2068)|
| 0:34:31| They launched their missile attacks from hospitals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2071)|
| 0:34:34| in order to make them targets for the IDF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| Hamas has shown that they don't truly care about the Palestinian people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2076)|
| 0:34:40| Palestinian civilians are simply shields made into targets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2080)|
| 0:34:44| so the Israeli counterattacks would inflict maximum casualties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2084)|
| 0:34:48| and generate pushback from uninvolved nations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2088)|
| 0:34:51| And Israel's response?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2091)|
| 0:34:53| Israel's given Hamas just what Hamas had anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2093)|
| 0:34:57| The widespread bombing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| the horrible suffering of the entire civilian population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2099)|
| 0:35:02| the starvation, the fear, the despair that has resulted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2102)|
| 0:35:06| Any person with an ounce of humanity wants this to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2106)|
| 0:35:10| But what can the city council of Knoxville, Tennessee, do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2110)|
| 0:35:13| The proposed resolution is totally one-sided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2113)|
| 0:35:17| It calls for Israel to stop all military action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2117)|
| 0:35:20| but makes no demands on the terrorists who initiated it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2120)|
| 0:35:23| It employs the incendiary term of genocide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2123)|
| 0:35:26| but doesn't acknowledge the stated aim of Hamas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2126)|
| 0:35:29| to wipe the Israeli people and their nation from the face of the earth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2129)|
| 0:35:33| It calls for an Israeli ceasefire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| but doesn't ask the Hamas terrorists to stop launching rockets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2135)|
| 0:35:39| or to release their helpless hostages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2139)|
| 0:35:41| The resolution proposes that Knoxville City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2141)|
| 0:35:44| ask the federal government to leverage its diplomatic relationships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2144)|
| 0:35:48| to prevent further violence and civilian deaths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2148)|
| 0:35:51| to safeguard Israeli and Palestinian lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2151)|
| 0:35:54| But our government is already trying to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2154)|
| 0:35:57| Imperfectly, yes, but there is no easy solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2157)|
| 0:36:01| Diplomacy is not simple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2161)|
| 0:36:03| and it requires both parties negotiating in good faith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2163)|
| 0:36:06| and willing to acknowledge each other's point of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2166)|
| 0:36:09| We know what doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| Understained expansion of Israeli settlements doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2171)|
| 0:36:15| Overuse of administrative detentions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| and crowding the Palestinians into enclaves doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2177)|
| 0:36:21| Also, constantly firing missiles at Israeli cities doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2181)|
| 0:36:26| Terror attacks to rape and butcher Israelis doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2186)|
| 0:36:30| Kidnapping innocents as hostages doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2190)|
| 0:36:34| And we are seeing that pervasive bombing that destroys everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2194)|
| 0:36:38| and in effect creates a famine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| is not an effective response to terror either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2200)|
| 0:36:43| It hasn't eradicated the monsters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| and it is breeding future terrorists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| Policy is not fashioned with slogans and soundbites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2207)|
| 0:36:51| Diplomatic solutions are fragile and perfect things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2211)|
| 0:36:54| and must be carefully crafted with empathy and compassion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2214)|
| 0:36:58| I ask the city council to contribute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| by taking the shouting down a notch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2220)|
| 0:37:03| Implore both sides, both sides, to really listen to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2223)|
| 0:37:07| Announce that you are looking for negotiations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2227)|
| 0:37:09| with compassion and understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2229)|
| 0:37:11| not more articulate and more strident voicing of grievances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2231)|
| 0:37:15| Encourage bilateral, but also unilateral,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2235)|
| 0:37:18| acts of de-escalation from both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2238)|
| 0:37:21| I ask you to do this as individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2241)|
| 0:37:24| by letting the federal government know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2244)|
| 0:37:26| you support their efforts to reduce the conflict,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2246)|
| 0:37:29| the acrimony, the fear, and the horror.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2249)|
| 0:37:32| Let family and friends in the Middle East know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| that you support their working on ways to live together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| not developing a better strategy to obliterate the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2257)|
| 0:37:41| What is that first step?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| I'm asking the city council to please turn down the heat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| by tabling this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2266)|
| 0:37:48| The resolution, as it is written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| is fatally flawed, biased, and ineffectual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| We know that neither containment, nor terror,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| nor inadequately estranged military initiatives have worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2275)|
| 0:37:59| The city council should not be encouraging either side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| to double down on its failed tactics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2282)|
| 0:38:05| or to amp up the volume by echoing overly simplistic slogans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2285)|
| 0:38:09| Don't trivialize this strategy by polling your constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2289)|
| 0:38:13| Determine what percentage wants either side to win this horrific contest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2293)|

| 0:39:13| be productive, we hoped that we would not have to re-engage with City Council on difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2353)|
| 0:39:18| and painful issues prompted by a resolution that would clearly provoke conflict among| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2358)|
| 0:39:22| Knoxville communities ever again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2362)|

| 0:40:16| This resolution will only continue to fuel hate speech and the anti-Israel, anti-Jewish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2416)|

| 0:43:52| Ms. Parker, as the author of this item, did you want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2632)|
| 0:43:56| You have up to eight minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2636)|

| 0:43:58| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2638)|
| 0:43:59| When I brought the resolution forward in November of 2023, the feedback that I received after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2639)|
| 0:44:13| introducing that resolution was that it went too far and that it was a missed opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2653)|
| 0:44:20| That's what I heard from those who attended and were able to speak with my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2660)|
| 0:44:26| about the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2666)|
| 0:44:29| And so I committed to writing a resolution that did not have language such as we stand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2669)|
| 0:44:40| with Palestine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2680)|

| 0:44:47| This resolution is simply an acknowledgment of the provisional orders of the International| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2687)|
| 0:44:57| Court of Justice and acknowledges the role that the U.S. plays or the obligation of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2697)|
| 0:45:10| U.S. in upholding that ruling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2710)|
| 0:45:15| And we have heard from the speakers tonight and those who have heard it in the media statements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2715)|
| 0:45:24| that have continually been made by elected leaders in this country that concern me, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2724)|
| 0:45:33| to me rise to the level of inciting violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2733)|
| 0:45:40| Therefore, it is important when we have elected officials who are making such statements about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2740)|
| 0:45:51| the use of U.S. tax dollars, the use of U.S. weapons, it is important that we speak up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2751)|
| 0:45:58| When I wrote the new resolution, I did want it to be inclusive and that's why I reached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2758)|
| 0:46:05| out to the Knoxville Jewish Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| I did not have contact information for the leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2767)|

| 0:46:23| My email was not well received, but I did follow up and asked if we could meet, if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2783)|
| 0:46:32| could exchange phone numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2792)|

| 0:46:41| I'm sure there are other leaders from the Muslim community who would have loved to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2801)|
| 0:46:45| been invited to that as well because I am open to the dialogue and I know others are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2805)|
| 0:46:52| as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| The resolution before us tonight simply states that regardless of our backgrounds, regardless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2814)|
| 0:47:03| of our beliefs, we are united by a commitment to our justice system, to our constitution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2823)|
| 0:47:14| which calls upon us to adhere to international law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2834)|
| 0:47:20| So when our leaders in our area are calling for actions by our U.S. government and those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2840)|
| 0:47:31| here in the audience today to do nothing in this moment, to allow what is currently taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2851)|

| 0:47:48| me it's even more important in these moments to speak up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2868)|
| 0:47:59| The resolution before us tonight is a short resolution and it's to the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2879)|
| 0:48:09| I would hope that we as a city can recognize our obligations, can recognize what is meant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2889)|
| 0:48:19| by the oath of office that we took because honestly what I'm hearing as reasons for why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2899)|
| 0:48:31| we should not pass this are arguments that make me even more committed to passing a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2911)|
| 0:48:41| like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=2921)|

| 0:50:10| have the power to take action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3010)|
| 0:50:13| And so that's why I brought this resolution forward today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3013)|
| 0:50:17| It is not the same resolution that came before us in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3017)|
| 0:50:22| It is calling upon us to acknowledge that the International Court of Justice is currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3022)|
| 0:50:31| investigating whether a genocide is taking place and while that is occurring, the U.S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3031)|
| 0:50:40| should not be sending weapons to a country that has been accused of committing acts of genocide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3040)|
| 0:50:57| It's a very simple resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3057)|
| 0:51:01| The resolution, in my opinion...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3061)|
| 0:51:05| Members of the audience, if you're not quiet, you'll be asked to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3065)|
| 0:51:10| Ms. Parker, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3070)|
| 0:51:11| The resolution doesn't call upon us to even understand the definition of genocide, quite honestly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3071)|
| 0:51:20| What it calls upon us to do is to uplift our systems of justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3080)|
| 0:51:27| And as an elected official, especially when there's a questioning of our systems of justice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3087)|
| 0:51:36| that is when I feel that we absolutely must have these conversations and we absolutely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3096)|
| 0:51:41| must act because upholding the rule of law, which requires our own government to follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3101)|
| 0:51:48| international law, is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3108)|
| 0:51:52| Please be quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3112)|
| 0:51:53| Ms. Parker, please go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3113)|
| 0:51:57| ...is important to our own democracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3117)|
| 0:51:59| And before I run out of time, I just want to say, Mayor Kincaid, I am outraged that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3119)|
| 0:52:06| you have locked people out of this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3126)|
| 0:52:08| I cannot believe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| I cannot believe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3130)|
| 0:52:23| Vice Mayor Smith and then Council Member Singh, please be quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3143)|
| 0:52:30| Be quiet or you'll be asked to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3150)|
| 0:52:33| Be quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3153)|
| 0:52:35| Members of the audience, be quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3155)|
| 0:52:38| Woman in the hat, be quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3158)|
| 0:52:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3162)|
| 0:52:43| I'm a low talker, so you're going to have to tone it down just for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3163)|
| 0:52:47| I appreciate everybody that's reached out to me, everybody that's here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3167)|
| 0:52:51| I met with a number of people who care deeply about this and I shared my perspective on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3171)|
| 0:52:56| and I was encouraged to share it here and that's what I'm going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3176)|
| 0:52:59| A lot of times when you sit here, there are a lot of assumptions about what's going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3179)|
| 0:53:03| in each other's brains and I think that's a human problem where we assume what's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3183)|
| 0:53:07| on in each other's brains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3187)|
| 0:53:09| Knoxville residents with family members in Israel and Gaza who have been harmed are suffering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3189)|
| 0:53:15| genuine pain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3195)|
| 0:53:17| You are right to be mortified by what you see for the past few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3197)|
| 0:53:24| We care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| I can tell you that I am prayerful and I've taken my own action personally, as we all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3206)|
| 0:53:31| do, to stand up for what we see that is awful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3211)|
| 0:53:36| I too lift up the desire for peacemakers to win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3216)|
| 0:53:41| For local leaders on the ground have not done well either to prevent or to resolve this war.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3221)|
| 0:53:49| I agree for the need for unrestricted humanitarian aid and for the U.S. government to use all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3229)|
| 0:53:56| means possible to stop the death of another single human life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3236)|
| 0:54:02| There is unity in this room on human dignity and I can promise you if you listen carefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3242)|
| 0:54:08| to some of the speakers, you can find the thread that is shared by both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3248)|
| 0:54:12| However, we're responsible for what happens here on the grounds in Knoxville and for Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3252)|
| 0:54:17| Parker, I agree with many of your sentiments and some of which I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3257)|
| 0:54:22| There is no limit to the number of injustices that this body or you see across the world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3262)|
| 0:54:29| or that the ICJ weighs in on, whether it be Gaza, Ukraine, or Myanmar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3269)|
| 0:54:40| Knoxville is responsible for legislation and oversight of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3280)|
| 0:54:46| The scale of human suffering in this awful war is hard to fathom, but it's not our responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3286)|
| 0:54:55| to place our judgment on foreign wars or injustices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3295)|
| 0:55:00| Our moral compass is not supreme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3300)|
| 0:55:04| Furthermore, this resolution makes no attempt to listen to the complexities for everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3304)|
| 0:55:11| involved in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3311)|
| 0:55:12| And again, if you listen carefully, you can hear leaders in this community, in this room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3312)|
| 0:55:19| who share leadership positions, who are willing to show real leadership as it relates to Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3319)|
| 0:55:26| discrimination, hate speech, and vulnerability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3326)|
| 0:55:30| And the feeling of living here and feeling discriminated against is unacceptable for anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3330)|
| 0:55:39| For those that support this resolution, I have earnestly heard your perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3339)|
| 0:55:44| For those I have met with, you have asked me to affirm your suffering, offer a balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3344)|
| 0:55:49| to leaders who are elected not up here, but who say awful things, and to agree to a desire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3349)|
| 0:55:57| for the halt of innocent life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| I agree, I hope you heard me, and I hope you hear me now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3359)|
| 0:56:05| There is real work to be done here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3365)|
| 0:56:08| As we've heard from many people in this room, you have experienced discrimination, something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3368)|
| 0:56:13| hateful said to you that, personally, I haven't heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3373)|
| 0:56:19| And we should put every bit of energy in this room into stamping that out here so there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3379)|
| 0:56:24| not war here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3384)|
| 0:56:27| I encourage those in this room, I encourage those in this room who are leaders, who have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3387)|
| 0:56:35| voiced their opinion both today and in previous meetings, to meet and work on Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3395)|
| 0:56:43| You have an opportunity to lead well, not just for short-term acknowledgement with resolutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3403)|
| 0:56:49| that clearly don't bring unity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3409)|
| 0:56:53| Real anti-discrimination, real community work is in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3413)|
| 0:56:58| If you don't have each other's phone numbers, I got them, I'll give them to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3418)|
| 0:57:03| And I'll show up whenever you want to have that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3423)|
| 0:57:07| So, there is real suffering in this room, there is real suffering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3427)|
| 0:57:11| People in this room have family members who have been kidnapped, murdered, starved, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3431)|
| 0:57:17| is real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3437)|
| 0:57:18| And I can speak a little bit for all of my colleagues that we all hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3438)|
| 0:57:21| I know the hearts of most, of all of these council members, and that's not lost on any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3441)|
| 0:57:26| of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3446)|
| 0:57:28| I, along with a lot of these other council members, will join you, but a resolution does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3448)|
| 0:57:32| not make a positive march towards a better Knoxville, it does not impact what's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3452)|
| 0:57:37| on in Gaza and Israel, and we are left with power to control what happens here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3457)|
| 0:57:44| What actually harms people here is what we should put every energy into, so that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3464)|
| 0:57:48| relatives abroad can see what real unity and hard work at war prevention and war resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3468)|
| 0:57:55| looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3475)|
| 0:57:57| I won't be supporting this resolution, and I'm out of time, but I do want you to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3477)|
| 0:58:01| that your pain is felt, and I will take this lightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3481)|

| 0:58:34| I feel the pain in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3514)|

| 0:58:53| of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3533)|
| 0:58:55| If we pass this resolution, I don't – we're going to see people – people will be feeling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3535)|
| 0:58:59| like winners and losers, and we're not that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3539)|
| 0:59:02| We're all losers while this is going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3542)|

| 1:00:31| Let's try it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3631)|
| 1:00:41| Council, let's take a five-minute recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3641)|
| 1:00:44| We hold you accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3644)|

| 1:00:57| those are all already passed on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3657)|
| 1:01:00| So if you have an item that begins with number nine, it's already been passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3660)|
| 1:01:05| And you're free to say if you want, but your item's over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3665)|
| 1:01:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3669)|

| 1:01:12| I think we're on item 11B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3672)|

| 1:02:12| If you could start by stating your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3732)|
| 1:02:15| And remember to press the little button on the microphone thing to turn it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3735)|
| 1:02:25| It's just right there on the base of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3745)|

| 1:02:53| All of that has gone out of my brain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3773)|
| 1:02:55| You guys know me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3775)|

| 1:03:02| I thought I did until I stood out there with all these empty seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3782)|
| 1:03:09| Resolution B, building a Tennessee-themed sports bar, a golf course range, putting range, an arcade, all the things in Councilwoman McKenzie's district and Councilwoman Ryder's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3789)|

| 1:03:50| Guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3830)|
| 1:03:51| Ours is being built, supposedly is going to be built, on top of a recycling, God knows who, what is in the soil, because I can't find where you all have done an EPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3831)|
| 1:04:08| Has the EPA done anything on this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3848)|
| 1:04:11| I did see where there are still people living in some of those houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3851)|
| 1:04:15| New York Street, May 4th, 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3855)|
| 1:04:28| In Buffalo, you know where they built theirs, the New York equivalency of ours, on top of a recycling, an old recycling center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3868)|
| 1:04:45| Something is wrong here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3885)|
| 1:04:49| Of course, we don't know what all you've been doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3889)|
| 1:04:52| Maybe you all haven't had it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3892)|
| 1:04:54| Got all the EPA you need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3894)|
| 1:04:56| Say, our kids can go over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3896)|

| 1:05:20| Lauren Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3920)|
| 1:05:21| I know you said that you wanted something in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3921)|
| 1:05:28| You were glad to see that it was a nonprofit organization helping the boys and girls learn how to play golf and how to have manners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3928)|
| 1:05:37| The boys and girls in East Knoxville have manners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3937)|
| 1:05:40| The boys and girls in North Knoxville have manners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3940)|
| 1:05:43| They don't have to play golf on a contaminated golf range to show their manners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3943)|
| 1:05:55| And if you had all this time, if this has been in the making, guys, this is not just yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3955)|
| 1:05:59| This is not last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3959)|
| 1:06:01| This is not August of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3961)|
| 1:06:04| August of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3964)|
| 1:06:05| This has been going on for years and years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3965)|
| 1:06:07| You guys had time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3967)|
| 1:06:09| You had time to find an empty place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3969)|
| 1:06:12| If you really and truly wanted to serve the boys and girls who are disadvantaged, what about East Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3972)|
| 1:06:21| What about the east side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3981)|
| 1:06:23| There are so many places on the east side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3983)|
| 1:06:29| This is just another example of you saying one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3989)|
| 1:06:32| It sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3992)|
| 1:06:33| We think you're doing such a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3993)|
| 1:06:37| But when you remember my onion analogy, every time I pull a piece of you guys back, I just keep getting more and more onion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=3997)|
| 1:06:47| More and more onion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4007)|
| 1:06:50| When are you going to stop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4010)|
| 1:06:52| All you've got to do is do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4012)|
| 1:06:54| Tommy Smith, you've got to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4014)|
| 1:06:58| Gwen McKenzie, Seema, I have no words for you after tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4018)|
| 1:07:02| None.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4022)|
| 1:07:03| Charlie, Debbie Helsley, I don't know you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4023)|
| 1:07:09| I think you are a decent person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4029)|
| 1:07:12| Lynn Fugate, I don't know you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4032)|
| 1:07:14| I think you are a decent person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4034)|
| 1:07:16| I think all of you are decent people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4036)|
| 1:07:18| Show it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4038)|

| 1:07:21| Show your decency for this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4041)|
| 1:07:27| I yield my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4047)|
| 1:07:30| I yield my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4050)|
| 1:07:33| Next person signed up to speak on this item in opposition is Rick Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4053)|
| 1:07:41| Mr. Roach, if you could come to the podium, state your name and address for the record, and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4061)|
| 1:07:46| Rick Roach, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4066)|
| 1:07:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4069)|
| 1:07:55| It's heck when you come in to a government meeting, a local government meeting, and basically you encounter a foster club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4075)|
| 1:08:05| And I'm going to address the issue first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4085)|
| 1:08:10| Let me address the issue first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4090)|
| 1:08:16| There's not enough environmental testing that you can do to make that site where people gather on a consistent basis and entertain themselves or they get entertained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4096)|
| 1:08:31| There's not enough remediation that you can do on that site, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4111)|
| 1:08:37| When I got involved with the Williams Creek watershed, okay, I had to kind of pick up on things real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4117)|
| 1:08:47| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4127)|
| 1:08:58| And so in that process, I found out, especially in the lower class income areas that were highly established because they were connected to industrial site areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4138)|
| 1:09:17| and in the predominantly black communities, Mechanicsville, Lonsdale, and more, how about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4157)|
| 1:09:25| And more importantly, East Knoxville, the pollution levels were off the charts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4165)|
| 1:09:31| And I was making requests over and over again, just as I was learning the level of devastation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4171)|
| 1:09:38| David Brace, you know what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4178)|
| 1:09:45| And nothing's been done with that property, this property concern, nothing, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4185)|
| 1:09:52| Nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4192)|
| 1:09:58| So I don't care how much soil you scrape, how much road, you've already done the road, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4198)|
| 1:10:06| Well, that means you want to move ahead, move along, and that's fine, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4206)|
| 1:10:12| This is not the normal site for this type of project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4212)|
| 1:10:18| It really isn't, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4218)|
| 1:10:24| Lauren, happy hollers, happy holler, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4224)|
| 1:10:31| You can't do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4231)|
| 1:10:37| This is an independent environmental study, bring in whoever you want, but they have no association with the company, with Encore, or with anybody else, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4237)|
| 1:10:52| No connection to UT. Bring them in and have them do an extensive environmental impact study and have them be approved by the EPA, not just TDEC, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4252)|
| 1:11:07| TDEC's just a mechanism for moving things along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4267)|
| 1:11:13| And they're swamped anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4273)|
| 1:11:15| They don't have enough people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4275)|
| 1:11:18| OK?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4278)|
| 1:11:19| So if it takes another six months just to get it done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4279)|
| 1:11:24| and then get the report done another six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4284)|
| 1:11:27| the evaluation, do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4287)|
| 1:11:29| But you need to table this right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4289)|
| 1:11:32| OK?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4292)|
| 1:11:33| If the owners of the property want to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4293)|
| 1:11:36| and give them a pilot, good googa mooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4296)|
| 1:11:42| Man, let them pay the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4302)|
| 1:11:44| Seriously, pay the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4304)|
| 1:11:45| Or make their deal with TDEC and get all the grant money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4305)|
| 1:11:48| they can get to do the testing or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4308)|
| 1:11:50| But let them do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4310)|
| 1:11:51| OK?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4311)|
| 1:11:53| Don't give them any assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4313)|
| 1:11:55| I mean, I know y'all want development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4315)|
| 1:11:57| I understand that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4317)|
| 1:11:59| But this ain't it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4319)|
| 1:12:01| This is not it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4321)|
| 1:12:02| And Mary, if you make another decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4322)|
| 1:12:07| to shut off seating, available seating, for a public meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4327)|
| 1:12:13| you're going to get to the city of Knoxville soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4333)|
| 1:12:18| Makes no sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4338)|
| 1:12:19| It really does not make any sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4339)|
| 1:12:21| Have some strength about this, all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4341)|
| 1:12:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4345)|
| 1:12:31| Council, that concludes the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4351)|
| 1:12:33| signed up to speak on this agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4353)|
| 1:12:35| Vice Mayor Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4355)|
| 1:12:37| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4357)|
| 1:12:38| I don't know if it's the developer or RJ or someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4358)|
| 1:12:41| from KCDC that wants to address the environmental concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4361)|
| 1:12:45| associated with this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4365)|
| 1:12:46| Ms. Justice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4366)|
| 1:12:47| What are the regulations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4367)|
| 1:12:48| What are required?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4368)|
| 1:12:49| What has this developer already done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4369)|
| 1:12:51| What do they have to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4371)|
| 1:12:52| Yes, this site is in the I-275 redevelopment area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4372)|
| 1:12:56| And part of the due diligence for moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4376)|
| 1:13:00| will be doing all the appropriate and further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4380)|
| 1:13:02| environmental study and remediation for the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4382)|
| 1:13:06| according to EPA's guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4386)|
| 1:13:09| What are some of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4389)|
| 1:13:10| Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4390)|
| 1:13:11| Soil remediation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4391)|
| 1:13:14| In the past, there have been some evaluations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4394)|
| 1:13:16| and discussions with TDEC and EPA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4396)|
| 1:13:19| on what suitable developments would be appropriate here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4399)|
| 1:13:23| And housing would not be allowed here, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4403)|
| 1:13:28| So it would need to be a commercial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4408)|
| 1:13:30| And we could talk all day about why that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4410)|
| 1:13:33| But there are certain and appropriate uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4413)|
| 1:13:35| for sites that have different levels of contamination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4415)|
| 1:13:38| And on the end of whatever remediation that has to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4418)|
| 1:13:42| will TDEC and the EPA have to approve that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4422)|
| 1:13:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4425)|
| 1:13:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4427)|
| 1:13:49| OK, any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4429)|
| 1:13:52| Seeing none, all those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4432)|
| 1:13:53| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4433)|
| 1:13:54| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4434)|
| 1:13:55| Yeah, just to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4435)|
| 1:13:56| This site here, even though it's not in East Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4436)|
| 1:13:59| it's close to Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4439)|
| 1:14:01| And months ago, I walked that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4441)|
| 1:14:03| with a member of the Lonsdale community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4443)|
| 1:14:06| who was somewhat excited about the possibilities of having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4446)|
| 1:14:09| youth in Lonsdale to be able to use that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4449)|
| 1:14:12| And I've talked with Mr. McKamey, who's the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4452)|
| 1:14:17| And we've already engaged in conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4457)|
| 1:14:20| about how to engage youth in the area on that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4460)|
| 1:14:25| So just to comment, those discussions are in the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4465)|
| 1:14:29| So we're not oblivious to engaging with people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4469)|
| 1:14:34| in those communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4474)|
| 1:14:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4476)|
| 1:14:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4477)|
| 1:14:39| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4479)|
| 1:14:40| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4480)|
| 1:14:42| I'm going to be voting against this item on the principle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4482)|
| 1:14:45| that we wouldn't do this for a private citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4485)|
| 1:14:48| And I've gotten weary of this is supposed to be free market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4488)|
| 1:14:56| Figure it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4496)|
| 1:14:57| Don't mean that to be harsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4497)|
| 1:14:58| But we don't do this for private citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4498)|
| 1:15:01| when they're trying to do something that they're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4501)|
| 1:15:04| going to be able to afford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4504)|
| 1:15:05| So I don't see why we should do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4505)|
| 1:15:10| Ms. Justice, could you just sort of explain a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4510)|
| 1:15:14| about our tax incentive, public-private partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4514)|
| 1:15:19| type things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4519)|
| 1:15:20| Yes, the public-private partnerships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4520)|
| 1:15:22| are certainly catered towards any developer that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4522)|
| 1:15:25| meets the criteria of needing to fulfill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4525)|
| 1:15:29| a gap in their financing in order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4529)|
| 1:15:30| to make a project viable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4530)|
| 1:15:32| It is certainly these programs that are larger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4532)|
| 1:15:37| Incentives are focused on commercial developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4537)|
| 1:15:41| and larger developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4541)|
| 1:15:43| And we do conduct a Municap report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4543)|
| 1:15:47| with a third-party financial analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4547)|
| 1:15:50| So it is pretty rigorous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4550)|
| 1:15:53| And the analysis of the financials and the equity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4553)|
| 1:15:56| and the capital that they're bringing to the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4556)|
| 1:15:59| is very much evaluated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4559)|
| 1:16:02| And we determine an appropriate incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4562)|
| 1:16:05| Thank you for explaining that to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4565)|
| 1:16:07| But I already knew that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4567)|
| 1:16:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4569)|
| 1:16:10| Council Member Ryder, your microphone light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4570)|
| 1:16:12| is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4572)|
| 1:16:13| But apparently, that's how we're supposed to light you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4573)|
| 1:16:15| Yes, that's what I'm calling it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4575)|
| 1:16:17| That's the only light we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4577)|
| 1:16:18| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4578)|
| 1:16:21| So I just want to, for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4581)|
| 1:16:23| clarify that this is solidly and all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4583)|
| 1:16:26| within the sixth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4586)|
| 1:16:28| Congratulations, Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4588)|
| 1:16:31| This looks like what I believe to be a good project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4591)|
| 1:16:34| to clean up a blighted, unused parcel, some of which,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4594)|
| 1:16:38| Mr. Cohen, I believe you might verify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4598)|
| 1:16:41| some of which is in the right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4601)|
| 1:16:43| and is non-taxpaying parcels at the moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4603)|
| 1:16:46| but will become taxpaying parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4606)|
| 1:16:48| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4608)|
| 1:16:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4611)|
| 1:16:51| So we're going to move property that was not ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4611)|
| 1:16:54| taxpaying from right-of-way to taxpaying parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4614)|
| 1:16:57| to increase the amount of taxpaying parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4617)|
| 1:16:59| And as Ms. Justice said, property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4619)|
| 1:17:01| that would not be suitable for housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4621)|
| 1:17:03| so we couldn't make more housing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4623)|
| 1:17:07| And I also want to, for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4627)|
| 1:17:08| because I've just read the only media I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4628)|
| 1:17:10| spoke to about this project, unless I mistyped something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4630)|
| 1:17:14| on Facebook answering a constituent question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4634)|
| 1:17:17| I believe I spoke to Compass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4637)|
| 1:17:18| And I've looked at their article.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4638)|
| 1:17:20| For the record, I didn't say anything about manners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4640)|
| 1:17:23| I said stuff about youth being able to play this activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4643)|
| 1:17:28| and do this sport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4648)|
| 1:17:30| First Tee is an organization, not Boys and Girls Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4650)|
| 1:17:35| First Tee is an organization that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4655)|
| 1:17:36| has long been in the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4656)|
| 1:17:38| and I believe is a national organization that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4658)|
| 1:17:41| helps youth get into golf, which is not a sport that I'm into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4661)|
| 1:17:44| Though I am from Augusta, Georgia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4664)|
| 1:17:46| I was not raised as a pro-golf person, but great for others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4666)|
| 1:17:50| And by the way, as my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4670)|
| 1:17:52| young girls who get introduced to golf,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4672)|
| 1:17:54| if they're even moderately mediocre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4674)|
| 1:17:56| they can get a free ride to college| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4676)|
| 1:17:58| because there are very few women playing golf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4678)|
| 1:18:00| So on that note, I wish somebody had introduced me to golf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4680)|
| 1:18:03| and my dad hadn't have been anti-golf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4683)|
| 1:18:04| So I know Mr. McKamey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4684)|
| 1:18:08| I spoke to him years ago about this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4688)|
| 1:18:12| Anyway, I just wanted to comment since it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4692)|
| 1:18:14| was stated that I said something that I didn't say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4694)|
| 1:18:17| and I wanted to correct the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4697)|
| 1:18:19| I see Ms. Sparks was not feeling well on his left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4699)|
| 1:18:22| so I'm sorry that she's not here to hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4702)|
| 1:18:25| But I do appreciate, as my children's kindergarten teacher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4705)|
| 1:18:27| that she did work with my children on manners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4707)|
| 1:18:30| because they always need work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4710)|
| 1:18:33| And I appreciate her efforts in that category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4713)|
| 1:18:35| So we'll let her know that next time she is able to join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4715)|
| 1:18:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4719)|
| 1:18:42| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4722)|
| 1:18:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4723)|
| 1:18:45| Ms. Justice, the proposed pilot, I believe that's nine years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4725)|
| 1:18:51| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4731)|
| 1:18:52| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4732)|
| 1:18:53| OK, and that's relatively a shorter term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4733)|
| 1:18:56| than a lot of pilots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4736)|
| 1:18:58| It is a shorter term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4738)|
| 1:18:59| We've been focusing all of our incentives under 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4739)|
| 1:19:03| Right, and you may not have these numbers in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4743)|
| 1:19:08| I forgive you, and you can get them to me later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4748)|
| 1:19:10| Any estimate of how much tax revenue that's bringing in now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4750)|
| 1:19:15| and how much we estimate it will eventually bring in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4755)|
| 1:19:20| I do have that somewhere on my computer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4760)|
| 1:19:22| and I'm happy to send that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4762)|
| 1:19:24| It's in the AIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4764)|
| 1:19:26| Do you have that voice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4766)|
| 1:19:27| I do have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4767)|
| 1:19:28| Sir, right now, I think we just get $4,423 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4768)|
| 1:19:37| Once this is complete construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4777)|
| 1:19:40| and the pilot rolls off, we'll get $185,705,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4780)|
| 1:19:46| which means the simple payback on the pilot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4786)|
| 1:19:50| is only eight years and eight months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4790)|
| 1:19:53| and we'll be making $185,705 more per year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4793)|
| 1:19:56| in property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4796)|
| 1:19:59| And just a general comment, I'm pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4799)|
| 1:20:03| familiar with that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4803)|
| 1:20:04| We all know what its past has been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4804)|
| 1:20:06| and I've walked it several times to try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4806)|
| 1:20:08| to figure out some kind of possibilities for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4808)|
| 1:20:12| and I can't imagine anything else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4812)|
| 1:20:16| that is going to work there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4816)|
| 1:20:18| At least, there may be other things that will work there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4818)|
| 1:20:20| but nothing has been forthcoming for quite a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4820)|
| 1:20:24| So this looks like the best opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4824)|
| 1:20:27| we have to reclaim blighted property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4827)|
| 1:20:30| and then get it back on the tax rolls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4830)|
| 1:20:33| and also to use it to engage the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4833)|
| 1:20:36| And for the record, I'm not a golfer either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4836)|
| 1:20:38| I haven't had a golf club in my hand since I was in college,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4838)|
| 1:20:41| and I think that was only once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4841)|
| 1:20:44| But anyway, there's a lot of interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4844)|
| 1:20:47| to bring in youth to this sport, and I can encourage that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4847)|
| 1:20:52| So I just don't think that a better use of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4852)|
| 1:20:58| is not on the horizon, let me put it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4858)|
| 1:21:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4863)|
| 1:21:04| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4864)|
| 1:21:06| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4866)|
| 1:21:07| And so I also want to interject that it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4867)|
| 1:21:09| like this is prime property that a lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4869)|
| 1:21:12| are beating the doors down to want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4872)|
| 1:21:14| to have an opportunity to do something with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4874)|
| 1:21:16| because those options are limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4876)|
| 1:21:18| This will be a $30 million investment in that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4878)|
| 1:21:23| It's also, and I don't think that any of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4883)|
| 1:21:25| mentioned that, it's going to bring jobs there as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4885)|
| 1:21:29| because it will hopefully be able to employ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4889)|
| 1:21:32| young people and adults from the East Knoxville community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4892)|
| 1:21:36| I think the mistake was said that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4896)|
| 1:21:40| was part of Lawrence District, because just a matter of fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4900)|
| 1:21:43| is that the 6th District is the only district in the city that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4903)|
| 1:21:46| touches every other district in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4906)|
| 1:21:49| And so I think that's why that mistake was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4909)|
| 1:21:52| But again, I'm excited that someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4912)|
| 1:21:55| has shown the interest, that has done the work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4915)|
| 1:21:57| to see how they could make something positive work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4917)|
| 1:22:01| in this area and on that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4921)|
| 1:22:05| If anyone is not familiar with where it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4925)|
| 1:22:08| the blight, the things that were going on there previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4928)|
| 1:22:13| I've been down there a couple of times every time I go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4933)|
| 1:22:15| and they've cleaned it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4935)|
| 1:22:16| You come back a week or two later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4936)|
| 1:22:18| it looks like a trash dump again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4938)|
| 1:22:20| And so not the safest area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4940)|
| 1:22:23| So I am glad to see something positive that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4943)|
| 1:22:25| will be able to give back and contribute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4945)|
| 1:22:28| to the city on the tax rolls and then to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4948)|
| 1:22:30| as it relates to jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4950)|
| 1:22:32| And so because of that and a few other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4952)|
| 1:22:34| I am definitely in favor and encourage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4954)|
| 1:22:38| folks that are wanting to invest in our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4958)|
| 1:22:42| and in our communities, if we have incentives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4962)|
| 1:22:45| that can help that become a possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4965)|
| 1:22:47| to go through the process and see if they can make the cut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4967)|
| 1:22:50| before it comes to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4970)|
| 1:22:52| So that's all I have to say about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4972)|
| 1:22:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4975)|
| 1:22:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=4976)|

| 1:28:28| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=5308)|

| 1:37:03| for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=5823)|
| 1:37:03| My name is Adronikos Thomas, 3236 Wilson Avenue, Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=5823)|
| 1:37:09| Tennessee, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=5829)|
| 1:37:12| I'm here to speak about some injustice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=5832)|
| 1:37:15| that I feel that is going on at Knoxville Community Development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=5835)|
| 1:37:18| Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=5838)|
| 1:37:20| I've been an employee of Knoxville Community Development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=5840)|
| 1:37:23| Corporation for 31 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=5843)|
| 1:37:25| I worked for 14, 15 years supposedly in a gun zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=5845)|
| 1:37:30| down in Austin Homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=5850)|
| 1:37:33| During the pandemic, we had a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=5853)|
| 1:37:37| of things going on in housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=5857)|
| 1:37:40| We had upper management that instructed tenants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=5860)|
| 1:37:44| to not to pay their rent so they could collect ERA money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=5864)|
| 1:37:49| When this program was ended, a lot of those tenants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=5869)|
| 1:37:55| was left with $10,000, $5,000 in back rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=5875)|
| 1:38:01| with no way to pay their rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=5881)|
| 1:38:05| Now, we're at a point that we are evicting those tenants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=5885)|
| 1:38:10| for doing what upper management at KCDC instructed them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=5890)|
| 1:38:16| And you say, why are you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=5896)|
| 1:38:19| Why are you not at the board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=5899)|
| 1:38:21| Why are you didn't take this to the CEO?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=5901)|
| 1:38:24| I did it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=5904)|
| 1:38:25| I can show you emails after emails that I sent to the CEO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=5905)|
| 1:38:31| and he did not respond until the third one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=5911)|
| 1:38:35| And then he said this could be handled during appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=5915)|
| 1:38:39| during a grievance hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=5919)|
| 1:38:42| But this is a policy flaw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=5922)|
| 1:38:44| Now that we're facing eviction, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=5924)|
| 1:38:48| have instructed us to do promissory notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=5928)|
| 1:38:52| Been a 31-year employee of KCDC, and I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=5932)|
| 1:38:56| never heard of a promissory note within HUD policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=5936)|
| 1:39:00| We do have a repay agreement at HUD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=5940)|
| 1:39:05| which states that we can only charge up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=5945)|
| 1:39:09| to 40% of their income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=5949)|
| 1:39:12| That's 30% for rent and 10% for the repay agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=5952)|
| 1:39:18| We are charging people at least 200%, 300% of their income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=5958)|
| 1:39:24| I have one lady that pays $250 a month for rent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=5964)|
| 1:39:31| and her repay agreement is over $800.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=5971)|
| 1:39:35| Because the only instruction we have from upper management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=5975)|
| 1:39:39| is that they pay 20% of their balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=5979)|
| 1:39:42| and they have six months to pay off everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=5982)|
| 1:39:46| All of this have been brought to the attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=5986)|
| 1:39:48| of the people on the board, as well as our CEO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=5988)|
| 1:39:52| There's a high rate of vacancies at KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=5992)|
| 1:39:56| There's a high rate of turnover at KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=5996)|
| 1:39:59| We have one property that has had seven managers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=5999)|
| 1:40:03| within the last year due to lack of leadership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6003)|
| 1:40:08| lack of training, and not listen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6008)|
| 1:40:11| to the concerns of the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6011)|
| 1:40:14| I could have brought a lot of employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6014)|
| 1:40:15| here like we brought to the board meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6015)|
| 1:40:19| but for fear of retaliation, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6019)|
| 1:40:21| happened after we went to the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6021)|
| 1:40:24| they are willing to speak to you all in confidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6024)|
| 1:40:27| if you have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6027)|
| 1:40:30| I got 31 years in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6030)|
| 1:40:32| My mama would roll over in her grave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6032)|
| 1:40:34| if she knew if I was going to kick out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6034)|
| 1:40:36| a little old lady that's 80 years old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6036)|
| 1:40:39| that someone told her not to pay her rent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6039)|
| 1:40:43| and now you are forcing me to kick her out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6043)|
| 1:40:47| I have a lady who is a parent of three kids who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6047)|
| 1:40:52| had a mental breakdown just two weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6052)|
| 1:40:56| worrying about how she was going to pay this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6056)|
| 1:40:58| after KCDC told them not to pay their rent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6058)|
| 1:41:02| the ERA program was going to pay them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6062)|
| 1:41:05| I got all these documents that I can provide for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6065)|
| 1:41:08| You have never seen me here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6068)|
| 1:41:10| I'm a public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6070)|
| 1:41:12| I'm on the election commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6072)|
| 1:41:13| This is an injustice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6073)|
| 1:41:15| I'm just asking for some help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6075)|
| 1:41:17| I asked for a meeting with our CEO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6077)|
| 1:41:20| He refused to meet with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6080)|
| 1:41:22| He pushed us off on a new hire, Sabrina Draplin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6082)|
| 1:41:28| that was not familiar with everything that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6088)|
| 1:41:31| was going on in public housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6091)|
| 1:41:33| Just this day, at 2.30, I had a meeting with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6093)|
| 1:41:37| She told me that the promissory note was KCDC procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6097)|
| 1:41:44| And I asked her, do KCDC procedure supersedes HUD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6104)|
| 1:41:49| procedure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6109)|
| 1:41:51| She would not answer my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6111)|
| 1:41:53| She said, the procedure do not have to go before the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6113)|
| 1:41:57| My time is running out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6117)|
| 1:41:59| So if you would, please, please look into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6119)|
| 1:42:04| I've seen the police chief at my development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6124)|
| 1:42:07| more in the last year than I have my CEO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6127)|
| 1:42:10| Mr. Thomas, your time is up, but if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6130)|
| 1:42:11| could, at the conclusion of the meeting, someone from my staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6131)|
| 1:42:14| will get your contact information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6134)|
| 1:42:15| and follow up with you later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6135)|
| 1:42:17| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6137)|
| 1:42:20| Next person signed up is Amanda Jacobson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6140)|
| 1:42:23| Ms. Jacobson, are you present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6143)|
| 1:42:26| Amanda Jacobson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6146)|
| 1:42:29| Next person is Alexis Gibson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6149)|
| 1:42:32| Ms. Gibson, if you could start by stating your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6152)|
| 1:42:34| and address for the record, and you'll have up to five minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6154)|
| 1:42:37| to address council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6157)|
| 1:42:41| Before I start, who do I talk to about discrimination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6161)|
| 1:42:45| and being racially discriminated against?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6165)|
| 1:42:49| Because I've made several attempts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6169)|
| 1:42:51| I've called several different Congress members and senators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6171)|
| 1:42:54| I believe I left a voicemail on Mr. Roberto's voicemail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6174)|
| 1:42:58| the other day, because I couldn't figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6178)|
| 1:43:00| where my district was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6180)|
| 1:43:02| So if someone could help me with who I talk to about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6182)|
| 1:43:06| that'd be super nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6186)|
| 1:43:08| That was my one question about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6188)|
| 1:43:09| but could I actually have what I wanted to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6189)|
| 1:43:13| Because I'm at 428, and I'd really just wanted to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6193)|
| 1:43:16| is that an answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6196)|
| 1:43:17| Can I ask somebody for help up here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6197)|
| 1:43:20| At the end of the meeting, someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6200)|
| 1:43:21| can try to find out what you're asking exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6201)|
| 1:43:24| OK, cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6204)|
| 1:43:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6205)|
| 1:43:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6206)|
| 1:43:27| Could I have my time back a little bit, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6207)|
| 1:43:30| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6210)|
| 1:43:31| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6211)|
| 1:43:35| My name's Alexis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6215)|
| 1:43:36| I'm at 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6216)|
| 1:43:39| I grew up here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6219)|
| 1:43:41| And I will be the first one to tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6221)|
| 1:43:43| that Knoxville is one of the most racist cities I've ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6223)|
| 1:43:45| been a part of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6225)|
| 1:43:46| And you know how?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6226)|
| 1:43:47| Because I'm mixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6227)|
| 1:43:49| My dad was adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6229)|
| 1:43:50| I have the documentation where he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6230)|
| 1:43:52| had to sign an affidavit that his mom was for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6232)|
| 1:43:54| like his mom had to sign this affidavit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6234)|
| 1:43:56| that his dad was black.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6236)|
| 1:43:57| You know, you had to do that in the South.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6237)|
| 1:43:59| I remember in 2013, in May, when Gibbs High School hung up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6239)|

| 1:44:06| and they chopped up the turtle, and they put it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6246)|
| 1:44:08| in the mailbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6248)|
| 1:44:10| And the principal said it was not race-related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6250)|
| 1:44:12| But if anybody understands any black terminology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6252)|
| 1:44:14| you know that there's a message in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6254)|
| 1:44:18| So starting off, a few sessions ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6258)|
| 1:44:22| I witnessed this council discuss current human resource| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6262)|
| 1:44:25| standards in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6265)|
| 1:44:26| And the gentlelady, who is the head of HR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6266)|
| 1:44:27| stated that she was adequately equipped to handle the task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6267)|
| 1:44:31| Yet at no point since she has taken office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6271)|
| 1:44:33| have I seen anything regarding the attacks on DEI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6273)|
| 1:44:36| Diversity, equity, and inclusion are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6276)|
| 1:44:39| organizational frameworks which seek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6279)|
| 1:44:41| to promote the fair treatment and full participation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6281)|
| 1:44:43| of all people, particularly groups who have historically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6283)|
| 1:44:46| been underrepresented or subject to discrimination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6286)|

| 1:44:57| I live in Knoxville, and I grew up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6297)|
| 1:44:59| To say this conflict does not involve Knoxville is a lie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6299)|
| 1:45:02| and is a cowardly one at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6302)|
| 1:45:04| India Kincannon pulled this city into this war| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6304)|
| 1:45:06| before she stood in solidarity with Israel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6306)|
| 1:45:08| But it was only after she made a bold political statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6308)|
| 1:45:11| in an international community that she really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6311)|
| 1:45:13| nailed her coffin shut to me that she's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6313)|
| 1:45:15| just another racist woman masquerading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6315)|
| 1:45:17| as one of the good ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6317)|
| 1:45:18| You know how I know that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6318)|
| 1:45:19| Because you signed up for FLOC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6319)|
| 1:45:21| And FLOC services is actually serviced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6321)|
| 1:45:24| under Amazon Web Services, which is also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6324)|
| 1:45:27| serviced for half of the United States after 2020 happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6327)|
| 1:45:31| We all uploaded our what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6331)|
| 1:45:33| Our I-9s, our Social Security numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6333)|
| 1:45:36| all of those like Employee Navigator, I'm sure ADP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6336)|
| 1:45:40| all of those use web services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6340)|
| 1:45:42| And you're either going to be using Google or Oracle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6342)|
| 1:45:44| or Amazon Web Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6344)|
| 1:45:47| Oracle is the service for the Department of Defense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6347)|
| 1:45:50| It was part of Project Jedi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6350)|
| 1:45:52| And there was this back and forth because Trump| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6352)|
| 1:45:54| discriminated against Amazon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6354)|
| 1:45:55| And they had to redo it and ultimately went to Oracle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6355)|
| 1:45:58| Well, under Project Nimbus, which if anybody doesn't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6358)|
| 1:46:01| the entire internet is under the ocean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6361)|
| 1:46:03| It's not in the cloud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6363)|
| 1:46:04| It's not on satellites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6364)|
| 1:46:06| All of the internet connections run through to where?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6366)|
| 1:46:09| The Middle East.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6369)|
| 1:46:11| Israel is the number one cybersecurity giant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6371)|
| 1:46:14| in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6374)|
| 1:46:14| It has got the most technology out of anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6374)|
| 1:46:17| All right, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6377)|
| 1:46:18| We don't want to talk about the Israeli-Palestinian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6378)|
| 1:46:20| conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6380)|
| 1:46:20| What I want to talk about is domestic abuse survivors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6380)|
| 1:46:23| You've got flat cameras at the end of every entrance and exit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6383)|
| 1:46:26| to this city, which sends AI-regulated data that's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6386)|
| 1:46:29| monitored by a regular person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6389)|
| 1:46:31| But it just tracks and records your information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6391)|
| 1:46:33| And then it sends it and stores it on Amazon Web Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6393)|
| 1:46:36| Right, sounds great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6396)|
| 1:46:37| Except on Project Nimbus, it's a four-part contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6397)|
| 1:46:40| determined with Google and Amazon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6400)|
| 1:46:42| to send all of your data to Israel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6402)|
| 1:46:44| So if it's secure, why aren't we keeping it here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6404)|
| 1:46:47| Why are we sending it to the most contested conflict zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6407)|
| 1:46:50| in the entire United States?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6410)|
| 1:46:51| I mean, like, in the entire world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6411)|
| 1:46:53| The other thing about that is it's discriminatory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6413)|
| 1:46:55| because you have a large Palestinian population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6415)|
| 1:46:58| You have a large black and criminal population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6418)|
| 1:47:00| because the South is poor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6420)|
| 1:47:02| And Baselow's hierarchy of needs, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6422)|
| 1:47:05| you're going to have thieves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6425)|

| 1:47:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6431)|

| 1:47:12| Because it doesn't seem like y'all like music here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6432)|
| 1:47:15| But the issue is that you guys are hurting people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6435)|
| 1:47:19| beyond what you think you're right about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6439)|
| 1:47:21| And you can laugh at me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6441)|
| 1:47:22| You can smirk at me behind my back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6442)|
| 1:47:24| because you guys know about your parents on social media,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6444)|
| 1:47:27| but you can't tell if your kids are being trafficked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6447)|
| 1:47:29| Tennessee is one of the worst ones for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6449)|
| 1:47:32| because we have our two national highways and a regional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6452)|
| 1:47:34| airport, but the flock cameras haven't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6454)|
| 1:47:36| caught any sex rings or any of the missing kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6456)|
| 1:47:39| or that missing autistic kid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6459)|

| 1:48:55| why you don't want to live in this farce of a country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6535)|

| 1:49:31| is called The World We Want Is Us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240319?start=6571)|
