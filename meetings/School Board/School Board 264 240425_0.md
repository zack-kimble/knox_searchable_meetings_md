| 0:19:49| Good evening. We just have a few announcements before we begin our special call meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1189)|
| 0:19:55| I just wanted to let you know that Dr. Reiswick and I have made the decision to cancel the May 17th policy review meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1195)|
| 0:20:01| There are several reasons including scheduled conflicts for multiple board members that I've been made aware of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1201)|
| 0:20:08| but also it's an extremely busy time for staff and we have graduation that night and three others starting at 1pm that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1208)|
| 0:20:16| So we will plan to cover the full G section at the June 28th policy review meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1216)|
| 0:20:22| And I know Ms. Himmelgarn feels good about that time frame as well since we did a lot of work to that section just a few months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1222)|
| 0:20:29| So I hope that time change works for everybody's schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1229)|
| 0:20:32| I also wanted to let you know that Mr. Wright has agreed to step into Mr. McMillan's previously appointed committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1232)|
| 0:20:39| and I have appointed him to serve on the Knox County Investment Committee and our own Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1239)|

| 0:20:56| That's a mouthful. That's a big one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1256)|
| 0:21:00| Ms. Christy is our board representative on the committee alongside Celeste as our current student representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1260)|

| 0:21:21| and community leader and partner Dr. Susan Dalton complete that committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1281)|
| 0:21:28| and it includes representation from each of our five regions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1288)|
| 0:21:32| Ms. Christy will be sharing information about their work at the May board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1292)|
| 0:21:36| And I know we're all looking forward to the announcements on who will be our next student representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1296)|
| 0:21:41| And I just want to say Celeste, you've been an amazing student representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1301)|
| 0:21:44| So thank you for your service to our board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1304)|
| 0:21:47| Also, United Way of Greater Knoxville is transitioning their working group into a Knox County Community School Steering Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1307)|
| 0:21:55| and made a request for a school board representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1315)|
| 0:21:57| So I'm going to serve on that committee until next year's appointments are made this fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1317)|
| 0:22:01| And I look forward to providing you with information on that work going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1321)|
| 0:22:06| And I know, I just want to say that I know a lot of us have heard from multiple people in the community about the current legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1326)|
| 0:22:14| And I know John and I had our agenda set meeting earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1334)|
| 0:22:18| And Ms. Christy is going to be bringing a resolution to our May meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1338)|

| 0:22:26| And just remember that today's special called meeting is for the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1346)|

| 0:24:55| I don't really want to go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1495)|
| 0:25:02| I have a couple of questions that I haven't had a chance to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1502)|
| 0:25:05| Looking at page A1 under certified subs, could someone give us a little clarity on what that decrease entails?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1505)|
| 0:25:16| There are several pages where we have decreases in certified subs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1516)|
| 0:25:25| Actually, A1 is an increase, and then I think the decrease is further along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1525)|
| 0:25:38| So if somebody could just tell us what those differences are. There's not an explanation there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1538)|
| 0:25:44| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1544)|
| 0:25:46| Oh, the tab I'm in is the general purpose budget, the actual budget, which is another issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1546)|
| 0:25:53| Having that as an appendix is really confusing, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1553)|
| 0:25:57| So I am in the general purpose budget, which may be your appendix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1557)|
| 0:26:02| And on page A1, we have an increase in certified subs. It's listed as a budgetary true-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1562)|
| 0:26:15| But then there are some other places where I see certified subs throughout where there are decreases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1575)|
| 0:26:21| So I'm trying to figure out what that budgetary true-up is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1581)|
| 0:26:24| Is that something that we budgeted for and we didn't have those subs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1584)|
| 0:26:30| And the reason I ask that is because I don't see anything for non-certified subs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1590)|
| 0:26:34| So I'm trying to understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1594)|
| 0:26:42| Madam Chair, Ms. Owen, I'll take the true-up first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1602)|
| 0:26:47| So the true-up would be an alignment to what we're actually spending on substitutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1607)|
| 0:26:53| a closer alignment to what we are spending on substitutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1613)|
| 0:26:56| There are, I can think of one specific area where there is a decreased budget for substitutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1616)|
| 0:27:04| And if there are others, we can go through those too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1624)|
| 0:27:06| There's one specifically for our lead teachers, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1626)|
| 0:27:10| There was a change in the allocation of lead teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1630)|
| 0:27:13| and then we also adjusted the substitutes that are provided for those lead teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1633)|
| 0:27:17| So that change was a decrease, so the substitutes were also decreased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1637)|
| 0:27:22| But if there's other specifics, we can go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1642)|
| 0:27:25| So if we're truing up looking at what we're actually spending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1645)|
| 0:27:29| and we are putting in a budget a number that's less because we don't have subs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1649)|
| 0:27:35| is that going to create a problem if we suddenly do have subs to cover our positions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1655)|
| 0:27:41| So I believe, if I'm understanding your question correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1661)|
| 0:27:46| I believe the true-up on A1 was an increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1666)|
| 0:27:50| Yes, there is an increase on A1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1670)|
| 0:27:53| And then when we look at A3, there's a decrease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1673)|
| 0:27:59| And then I believe there were some other decreases throughout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1679)|
| 0:28:03| So I'm wondering why I don't see it for non-certified subs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1683)|
| 0:28:14| I may need Dr. Wilson to help me on the A3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1694)|
| 0:28:17| I believe that the decrease in A3 is because that was out of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1697)|
| 0:28:22| Learning and Literacy Department specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1702)|
| 0:28:24| I believe it's that they were no longer using those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1704)|
| 0:28:27| So are these specific to planned absences?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1707)|
| 0:28:33| Are these not for teachers who are out sick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| Are these for in-service items and things like that only?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1716)|
| 0:28:42| It would be a different answer for a different line item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1722)|
| 0:28:46| So for the lead teachers that we talked about, those would be for planned absences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1726)|
| 0:28:50| for the lead teachers relief from the classroom to perform their lead teaching duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1730)|
| 0:28:54| For the A1, I may call on Mr. McPherson to verify for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1734)|
| 0:29:01| but I believe that that is for our substitutes for absences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1741)|
| 0:29:08| I got a thumbs-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1748)|
| 0:29:12| Okay, so the expectation is that we will spend more on absences next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1752)|
| 0:29:22| and less on some of the line items where we have had a planned in-service or absence for some reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1762)|
| 0:29:31| Under lead teachers specifically, yes, less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1771)|
| 0:29:34| For the budgetary true-up, I would need to verify whether we are budgeting more because we're spending more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1774)|
| 0:29:43| So I don't know that we will be actually spending more next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1783)|
| 0:29:49| We're budgeting more because we are spending more than we have allotted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1789)|
| 0:29:54| Yes. Okay, I get that. Thank you. I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1794)|
| 0:29:57| Dr. Wilson, did you want to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1797)|
| 0:29:58| Yes, Madam Chairman, Ms. Owen, I would clarify too what she's saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1798)|
| 0:30:02| especially in several of the areas that would fall under academics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1802)|
| 0:30:05| As you all know, we sort of pushed our folks to go back and look at things that were sort of held items, I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1805)|
| 0:30:11| over time in their budgets and decide if that was something that was going to be used on an annual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1811)|
| 0:30:16| And subs and PD was one of those pieces that they often leaned back into to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1816)|
| 0:30:20| I might need this every five years, but I don't need it every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1820)|
| 0:30:23| And so when you see that reduction in subs, like a $10,000 line item or something that's kind of in their control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1823)|
| 0:30:28| not like a teacher was sick, right, but just within their control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1828)|
| 0:30:31| that was a common item that many of them said was something they didn't need to keep in an annual budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1831)|
| 0:30:36| Thank you. And my next question may be for you also, Dr. Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1836)|
| 0:30:40| So I'm looking through here at all kinds of places where we are having decreases in instructional supplies and office and minor equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1840)|
| 0:30:51| And some of these are listed as true ups, some of them are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1851)|
| 0:30:54| But the thing that concerns me is that if I'm looking at decreases in instructional supplies, that seems to run counter to our goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1854)|
| 0:31:05| And so if these decreases, if the decreases are because teachers didn't spend it all in a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1865)|
| 0:31:16| is it because they had things from ESSER to fill in and are they going to be short in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1876)|
| 0:31:22| Or is it because, let me give you an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1882)|
| 0:31:27| When I had an allocation in a music classroom, I often didn't spend my whole allocation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1887)|
| 0:31:31| because my allocation was too small to purchase an instrument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1891)|
| 0:31:35| And I couldn't hold it over for the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1895)|
| 0:31:38| So I either had to find tiny things I could buy or I had to find someone else to supplement that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1898)|
| 0:31:45| So I'm trying to figure out what is happening with this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1905)|
| 0:31:51| Because overall, it's a large amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1911)|
| 0:31:53| Looking at it line by line, it's lots of small amounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1913)|
| 0:31:57| But when we look at the amount of instructional supplies that we are decreasing, I'm concerned about how those would be covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1917)|
| 0:32:06| So I would start by saying I think your question about things that have been purchased out of ESSER| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1926)|
| 0:32:11| and then looking across a number of different budgets, that answer is probably different for each of those different reductions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1931)|
| 0:32:18| Once again, our task with our academic supervisors as they looked at their budgets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1938)|
| 0:32:23| was to look into places where they had not fully utilized those resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1943)|
| 0:32:28| look into places where they had potentially maybe had the same budget for years and years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1948)|
| 0:32:35| and ask that question of what is really critical to us implementing our program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1955)|
| 0:32:39| And so in terms of those instructional supplies, again, content area by content area, that would be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1959)|
| 0:32:46| But the task they were given was to say what is really needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1966)|
| 0:32:49| and what do we need to make sure that we're hanging on to to support the programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1969)|
| 0:32:53| I would say to that point, when you think about instructional materials and supplies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1973)|
| 0:32:57| you think about changes in curriculum, you think about changes in what we're asking teachers to be prepared to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1977)|
| 0:33:03| that maybe have changed over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| Part of this is we're looking at budgets that were built a very long time ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1985)|
| 0:33:08| and that new supervisors have inherited and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1988)|
| 0:33:11| So there were some corrections in some places that they were able to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1991)|
| 0:33:15| and say that this has not been the best service of those dollars over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1995)|
| 0:33:19| Okay. And it's been a long time since I've asked this, but I would just like to throw it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=1999)|
| 0:33:26| I think it would be very beneficial if the board could have a listing of those allocations for each content area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2006)|
| 0:33:33| so that we could take a look at what those actually are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2013)|
| 0:33:36| And as an example, I would tell the board that when I was teaching 700 music students, my allocation was $150.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2016)|
| 0:33:44| So I had $150 for whatever I needed for 700 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2024)|
| 0:33:49| And that allocation has not changed significantly since that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2029)|
| 0:33:54| So I think if we could see some of those allocations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2034)|
| 0:33:57| especially when we're looking at a $15,000 cut in educational supplies and science,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2037)|
| 0:34:03| I think we need to see exactly what that's impacting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2043)|
| 0:34:08| I think that would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2048)|
| 0:34:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2049)|
| 0:34:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2050)|
| 0:34:16| I don't think I need that question answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2056)|
| 0:34:20| There's just one more thing I'd like to make sure the board thinks about as we look at things in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2060)|
| 0:34:27| When we are looking at our custodial budget and when we're talking about those positions that are being filled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2067)|
| 0:34:35| every time we are given a number of how many openings we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2075)|
| 0:34:41| I want to be sure that in our minds we add 20 to it because this budget is taking that 20 out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2081)|
| 0:34:48| And even though we've talked about making sure we add those back in as we're able,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2088)|
| 0:34:53| our custodians are understaffed as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2093)|
| 0:34:56| So removing those positions is not necessarily helping to retain custodians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2096)|
| 0:35:03| They need more help, not less help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2103)|
| 0:35:05| So every time we hear a number of vacancies, I want to be sure that we remember to add 20 in our minds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2105)|
| 0:35:14| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2114)|
| 0:35:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2118)|
| 0:35:19| Ms. Horne, I know your light was on before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2119)|
| 0:35:21| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| I think that's a good point, Ms. Owen, that we do need to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2123)|
| 0:35:27| I'm assuming, Ms. Hummelgarn, that if we're able to hire custodial staff in addition to what is budgeted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2127)|
| 0:35:36| I'm assuming that we would still be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2136)|
| 0:35:40| There would likely be funds from some other place as we get into this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2140)|
| 0:35:45| Would that be accurate to Ms. Owen's point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| Madam Chair, Ms. Horne, I think that we would be very pleased to announce that we were fully staffed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2147)|
| 0:35:55| even with the 20 FTE reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2155)|
| 0:36:00| And if that happens, then there could be a point in the future where we come before the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2160)|
| 0:36:07| and ask for some of those positions back in a future budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2167)|
| 0:36:10| Okay, good. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2170)|
| 0:36:11| That's what I assumed, but I think that's important just to make sure that everybody understands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2171)|
| 0:36:15| that just because we're taking them out of the budget doesn't mean that we couldn't find funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2175)|
| 0:36:21| to add those back if we have the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2181)|
| 0:36:24| So I think it's a wise decision to look at reality, and so I'm glad that it is like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2184)|
| 0:36:30| And hopefully you will have to come back to us and tell us that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2190)|
| 0:36:34| That would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2194)|
| 0:36:35| And I also think that Ms. Owen makes a good point about supplies and materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2195)|
| 0:36:41| because we always hear those kinds of things in the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2201)|
| 0:36:45| So we haven't talked a lot about that because we have had so many other issues with the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2205)|
| 0:36:51| but that's a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| I know that's a concern for most teachers throughout our system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2213)|
| 0:36:58| So that is absolutely a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2218)|
| 0:37:03| But I also do want to say I'm thankful, most importantly out of this whole budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2223)|
| 0:37:08| I think we just have to say to commend the staff for coming to us with a budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2228)|
| 0:37:16| that allows for us to address many of those issues that we've spent hours discussing over the past multiple years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2236)|
| 0:37:24| So we've talked about our secretarial staff, the salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2244)|
| 0:37:31| We've talked about the custodial staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| We've talked about nutrition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2253)|
| 0:37:34| We've talked about teacher salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| So I'm very, very thankful that we have a budget that we can be proud of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2256)|
| 0:37:41| that we can say we're getting everybody up to market value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2261)|
| 0:37:44| I mean, to be able to, like that's a really high note for me to be leaving the board on when it comes to that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2264)|
| 0:37:52| because we've struggled with this for so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2272)|
| 0:37:55| So I'm really thankful that the budget that you brought us last year helped put us in position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2275)|
| 0:38:02| to make this investment in our staff and an investment at every level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2282)|
| 0:38:07| So I really hope that every employee will understand that they are so very valued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2287)|
| 0:38:14| and that this board and the superintendent and the assistant superintendents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2294)|
| 0:38:21| and department chairs really value every single staff member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2301)|
| 0:38:26| and every single person that works for Knox County Schools is vital to the mission of the organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2306)|
| 0:38:32| So I just want to say thank you to the superintendent and the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2312)|
| 0:38:37| and just how excited I am for many of our employees that will hopefully feel like they are valued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2317)|
| 0:38:50| I agree, Ms. Horn. Thank you for that. Ms. Spike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2330)|
| 0:38:55| Thank you. I also agree with Ms. Horn and Ms. Owens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2335)|
| 0:39:00| and I'm so glad that we get to do this for our teachers and staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2340)|
| 0:39:05| And I'm especially in agreeance with the custodians and all of the other staff, including teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2345)|
| 0:39:13| but also the ones that are kind of thought of a little bit less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2353)|
| 0:39:18| As I understand, and I haven't been on the board that long, but with custodians especially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2358)|
| 0:39:26| what has been in the budget over time and over the decade or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2366)|
| 0:39:33| kind of the amount of positions continue to be cut, and I worry about that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2373)|
| 0:39:38| I know that they're not filled now, and I'm glad to hear that if we do fill them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2378)|
| 0:39:43| that we could revisit and then continue to fill past that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2383)|
| 0:39:48| And going with that, I'm also glad that we get to pay them more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2388)|
| 0:39:52| but has it been decided what market range that they will start at? Do we know that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2392)|
| 0:40:04| Madam Chair, Ms. Spike, yes, it has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| I think that they will be one of the first groups notified once that's all finalized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2406)|
| 0:40:13| because they are on the 260-day employment link, so their new pay would start sooner than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2413)|
| 0:40:23| So it's been decided, but they haven't been notified yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2423)|
| 0:40:25| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| I would just like to really, really request that they not start out on the very beginning market range,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2427)|
| 0:40:35| the very lowest one that starts at $14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| I would really love to see them start higher than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2438)|
| 0:40:42| As I understand, that's the lowest pay, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2442)|
| 0:40:45| The gray band 101 step zero is $14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2445)|
| 0:40:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2449)|
| 0:40:51| I would love to see them start a step higher than that, and I'm curious about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2451)|
| 0:41:00| so when they are notified, is that all staff that's notified at the same time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2460)|
| 0:41:04| So like school secretaries, bookkeepers, things like that, everyone gets notified?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2464)|
| 0:41:08| That's a good question, and that would be ideal if all were notified at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2468)|
| 0:41:14| I think that that likely will not happen because of the time crunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2474)|
| 0:41:20| The priority will be to notify the 255 and 260 employees first because their pay is affected first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2480)|
| 0:41:28| So they work on July 1, for example, and then the 221s and 200s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2488)|
| 0:41:34| So close in time, but unfortunately I don't think it will all be on the same day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2494)|
| 0:41:40| Do you think that the spread is over a week, two weeks of how they will get notified, or a month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2500)|
| 0:41:48| What are we looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2508)|
| 0:41:52| Hard to say exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2512)|
| 0:41:53| Yes, a month or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| I'll look at Mr. Bolton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| He can tell me if I am incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2517)|
| 0:42:00| Hopefully shorter than that, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2522)|
| 0:42:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2523)|
| 0:42:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2524)|
| 0:42:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2525)|
| 0:42:08| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| So one of the comments that I want to make is I think one of the strengths in this budget is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2532)|
| 0:42:17| my perception of it is it was developed much more bottom up than top down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2537)|
| 0:42:22| and I think whenever you have a budget like that, you're going to see some cuts and some additions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2542)|
| 0:42:28| in places that maybe you weren't used to seeing it because you're getting people influencing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2548)|
| 0:42:34| from different seats and different positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| And just to use Ms. Owens' example that she brought up earlier as an indication of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2556)|
| 0:42:40| I mean, I didn't look at it through this lens, but just doing a rough look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| it looks like there's also areas where instructional supplies increase, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2564)|
| 0:42:50| as well as the other area that we had mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2570)|
| 0:42:53| And so to me, I think I'm not surprised by that, and not just in that one category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2573)|
| 0:42:57| There's other categories as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2577)|
| 0:43:00| And so to me, regardless of how those numbers shook out, I have more confidence in the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2580)|
| 0:43:05| because I feel like we brought in more of the right audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2585)|
| 0:43:09| which are the people who are closest to the work, to help inform that budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2589)|
| 0:43:14| Because I'm sure if people at that level were saying we don't need as many supplies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2594)|
| 0:43:19| it's probably because they really don't in a certain area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2599)|
| 0:43:23| versus another area who says, hey, I really do need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2603)|
| 0:43:26| And again, I'm just using the supplies example because we already brought it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| but I'm sure there's lots of line items that are impacted that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2609)|
| 0:43:32| So I hope that's a practice, and I would assume, at least under Dr. Reiswitz' leadership, that it will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2612)|
| 0:43:37| But I hope that's a practice that we continue to maintain because I think we'll be healthier for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2617)|
| 0:43:41| and I think it will allow us to better align our resources on some of those other initiatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2621)|
| 0:43:47| that take more dollars because we're not retaining dollars in areas that aren't really needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2627)|
| 0:43:52| like what we're doing this year with what we've already mentioned in terms of our new pay schedule, salary schedule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2632)|
| 0:44:00| which obviously is going to be a critical thing for the school system to move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2640)|
| 0:44:05| and not just to maintain, but hopefully we'll also initiate the practice that's been recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2645)|
| 0:44:10| of doing something like that every five years, where we have a new study and kind of look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2650)|
| 0:44:14| are we at market and are we making the shifts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2654)|
| 0:44:17| Because what we don't want to do, no matter how excited I am and I think most of us are about this particular budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2657)|
| 0:44:22| is we don't want to wake up 15, 20 years from now and be like, oh my gosh, we're back in the same boat again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2662)|
| 0:44:27| So I'm just pushing that out there one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2667)|
| 0:44:33| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| I do want to say, Dr. Reiswitz and all the staff, I'm excited about this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2675)|
| 0:44:40| I think it's a very thoughtful budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2680)|
| 0:44:43| You guys really did the heavy lifting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2683)|
| 0:44:46| I was in some schools today and they're very excited about the pay schedule and the salary study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2686)|
| 0:44:52| So all good things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2692)|
| 0:44:55| So thank you for all your hard work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2695)|
| 0:44:58| And if there's no other discussion, Ms. Coatney, can we please do a roll call vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2698)|
| 0:45:03| Yes, ma'am. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| Dr. Butler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-240425?start=2705)|
