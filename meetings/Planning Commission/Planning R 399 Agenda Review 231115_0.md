| 0:00:31| What we'd like to do today is dive a little deeper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=31)|
| 0:00:34| into mental health and, in general, what the concept is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=34)|
| 0:00:38| We want to address some of the topics of interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=38)|
| 0:00:42| that arose out of the October planning commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=42)|
| 0:00:45| We want to share the goals and the testing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=45)|
| 0:00:48| that our staff has done over the last few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=48)|
| 0:00:50| We also want to provide an opportunity for more in-depth Q&A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=50)|
| 0:00:54| So we encourage you all, you can ask us questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=54)|
| 0:00:56| throughout the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=56)|
| 0:00:58| We do have a lot of slides, but please feel free to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=58)|
| 0:01:00| the boxes that you have when answering questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=60)|
| 0:01:07| So, as I said, we are going to provide this high-level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=67)|
| 0:01:10| overview of the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=70)|
| 0:01:12| We're also, as I mentioned, we're going to provide you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=72)|
| 0:01:14| with some brief overviews that also came up at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=74)|
| 0:01:16| October planning commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=76)|
| 0:01:20| Is there anything that's missing from this agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=80)|
| 0:01:23| that you all have wanted to cover as it relates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=83)|
| 0:01:25| to mental health?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=85)|
| 0:01:29| If something comes to you during the course of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=89)|
| 0:01:39| Does anyone have anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=99)|
| 0:01:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=102)|
| 0:01:52| So what is missing from this middle housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=112)|
| 0:01:57| Middle housing is, there it goes, half-scale building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=117)|
| 0:02:01| with multiple units in a walkable neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=121)|
| 0:02:04| This diagram represents the full range of housing types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=124)|
| 0:02:08| between the scale of single-family homes to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=128)|
| 0:02:11| we call them multi-unit buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=131)|
| 0:02:14| That really, this full range of housing is what needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=134)|
| 0:02:16| to be built to meet our housing needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=136)|
| 0:02:19| What we see in the middle are the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=139)|
| 0:02:25| what we see in the middle are housing types that represent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=145)|
| 0:02:27| what we call, what we're referring to as the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=147)|
| 0:02:30| And I think it's important to note here is that most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=150)|
| 0:02:32| neighborhoods built today and in the last 40 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=152)|
| 0:02:35| have either been multifamily or single-family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=155)|
| 0:02:38| And middle housing types such as duplexes, triplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=158)|
| 0:02:40| fourplexes really do provide a more diversity of housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=160)|
| 0:02:43| options that can support local serving retail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=163)|
| 0:02:46| and more transportation options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=166)|
| 0:02:49| So what will make a successful middle housing proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=169)|
| 0:02:52| or policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=172)|
| 0:02:54| So is it compatible with existing houses on the block?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=174)|
| 0:02:56| Is it comprised of smaller multiple units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=176)|
| 0:02:59| Is it located in a neighborhood that can actually support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=179)|
| 0:03:02| with infrastructure that can support these walkable areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=182)|
| 0:03:08| So any proposal should include a dimensional design standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=188)|
| 0:03:10| to ensure that it's compatible with the existing neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=190)|
| 0:03:13| It provides that additional opportunity for housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=193)|
| 0:03:16| And it really is focused on that specific area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=196)|
| 0:03:18| where the infrastructure is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=198)|
| 0:03:22| So where does middle housing work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=202)|
| 0:03:24| I've already touched on this, but you really need something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=204)|
| 0:03:27| to walk to besides more houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=207)|
| 0:03:29| Missing middle housing types are best located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=209)|
| 0:03:31| in that walkable context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=211)|
| 0:03:33| And walkable context means not just pedestrian facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=213)|
| 0:03:35| such as sidewalks and crosswalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=215)|
| 0:03:37| but also places to walk to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=217)|
| 0:03:38| So a walkable area is defined as a 10-minute walking distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=218)|
| 0:03:42| of centers that provide services, shopping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=222)|
| 0:03:44| and hopefully transit opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=224)|
| 0:03:49| Middle housing types are most successful when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=229)|
| 0:03:51| located in the existing or newly built walkable context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=231)|
| 0:03:55| The TDR, the Traditional Neighborhood Residential Lanes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=235)|
| 0:03:58| classification, which we focused on for this particular proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=238)|
| 0:04:02| is already designated in our long-range plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=242)|
| 0:04:06| and has a definition that aligns with areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=246)|
| 0:04:09| supportive of middle housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=249)|
| 0:04:11| So I'm going to read that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=251)|
| 0:04:12| So it's characterized by neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=252)|
| 0:04:13| where a mix of detached and detached housing, houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=253)|
| 0:04:16| sidewalks, and smaller lots and alleys exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=256)|
| 0:04:19| Neighborhoods where lots are typically less than 50 feet wide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=259)|
| 0:04:22| and usually have sidewalks, alleys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=262)|
| 0:04:24| and this area is essentially the 19th, 20th century grid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=264)|
| 0:04:29| neighborhoods of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=269)|
| 0:04:31| And that's what's done up here on the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=271)|
| 0:04:33| I know it's not a very good map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=273)|
| 0:04:34| You can't really see the details,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=274)|
| 0:04:35| but the areas highlighted in yellow, the darker yellow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=275)|
| 0:04:39| are the TDR areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=279)|
| 0:04:42| I'm going to turn it over to Lindsay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=282)|
| 0:04:44| She's going to go over how it's gone missing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=284)|
| 0:04:46| and how we can go about it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=286)|
| 0:04:51| So we will be kind of switching back and forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=291)|
| 0:04:53| several times through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=293)|
| 0:04:54| So this really is, we want to have an opportunity for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=294)|
| 0:04:58| to stop and ask questions at any point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=298)|
| 0:04:59| So please do stop us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=299)|
| 0:05:01| So we've shown some of these slides before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=301)|
| 0:05:05| but what we wanted to express is that there's really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=305)|
| 0:05:07| a large amount of precedent for these forms of housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=307)|
| 0:05:11| and these development patterns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=311)|
| 0:05:13| So on the left side, you can see an example of plan books,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=313)|
| 0:05:16| like the Sears catalog that has sold duplexes, quadplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=316)|
| 0:05:21| et cetera, for widespread distribution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=321)|
| 0:05:23| throughout the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=323)|
| 0:05:25| There's actually an example similar to the one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=325)|
| 0:05:27| on the left on Clinch Avenue and Alexander's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=327)|
| 0:05:30| Some variations on that are seen throughout Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=330)|
| 0:05:34| These forms remain within our existing historic neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=334)|
| 0:05:37| So the aerial view that you see on the bottom right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=337)|
| 0:05:40| that's in Fort McGill, and that you can see a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=340)|
| 0:05:46| yeah, so you can see a small multiplex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=346)|
| 0:05:48| that's what we would call it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=348)|
| 0:05:50| And then I believe there's a quadplex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=350)|
| 0:05:53| and then also some duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=353)|
| 0:05:55| And the visual here is that these all do fit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=355)|
| 0:05:57| within the streetscape that also has single family houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=357)|
| 0:06:00| visible there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=360)|
| 0:06:02| The top right is a plan book example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=362)|
| 0:06:05| of a minimal traditional house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=365)|
| 0:06:07| So this is a housing form that originated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=367)|
| 0:06:09| in the mid to late 1930s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=369)|
| 0:06:12| and it was especially popular immediately after World War II.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=372)|
| 0:06:15| These were designed as single family houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=375)|
| 0:06:18| but they were really small units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=378)|
| 0:06:20| and I think the thing to consider here is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=380)|
| 0:06:22| they were designed to be added onto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=382)|
| 0:06:24| So here you can see this one has a side addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=384)|
| 0:06:28| out of a minimal traditional that has a dormer addition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=388)|
| 0:06:30| so it got a second story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=390)|
| 0:06:32| And then there's a rear addition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=392)|
| 0:06:33| so it could have a larger kitchen at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=393)|
| 0:06:36| These forms of housing are really prevalent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=396)|
| 0:06:39| in the TDR land use areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=399)|
| 0:06:40| A lot of the neighborhoods that are in this land use area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=400)|
| 0:06:43| have the minimal traditional housing forms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=403)|
| 0:06:46| and these are naturally supportive to additions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=406)|
| 0:06:49| and the conversion side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=409)|
| 0:06:50| So there's small input plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=410)|
| 0:06:52| These are originally one unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=412)|
| 0:06:54| but they were designed to accommodate additions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=414)|
| 0:06:56| on the sides, the rear, and in the dormers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=416)|
| 0:06:59| so that could hold another small unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=419)|
| 0:07:01| especially in the areas of these neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=421)|
| 0:07:04| that have significant slope changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=424)|
| 0:07:06| I'm thinking of Delmore's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=426)|
| 0:07:08| but the rear elevations may have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=428)|
| 0:07:11| a sort of walkout basement level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=431)|
| 0:07:12| that could easily support a rear addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=432)|
| 0:07:14| for a smaller addition and a second unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=434)|
| 0:07:18| We've had questions like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=438)|
| 0:07:19| That's the first time I remember that type being discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=439)|
| 0:07:22| I've seen the other two examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=442)|
| 0:07:25| I guess, how does that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=445)|
| 0:07:29| or Winston, can you use that name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=449)|
| 0:07:31| how does that example where it does start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=451)|
| 0:07:33| as a single family fit into the missing middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=453)|
| 0:07:37| since most of what we've talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=457)|
| 0:07:39| seems to be these being like private homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=459)|
| 0:07:42| Yeah, so I think this ties back to something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=462)|
| 0:07:44| that y'all had a lot of discussion about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=464)|
| 0:07:46| at the commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=466)|
| 0:07:47| and we've heard a lot about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=467)|
| 0:07:48| is the conversion aspect of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=468)|
| 0:07:50| So how do we retain our existing housing stock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=470)|
| 0:07:53| and the look of the existing streetscape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=473)|
| 0:07:55| while allowing these houses to accommodate more units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=475)|
| 0:07:58| if the property owners wanted to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=478)|
| 0:08:00| And one of the things is that a lot of the neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=480)|
| 0:08:03| in the TER aren't our oldest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=483)|
| 0:08:05| as in Forth and Gill and Old North| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=485)|
| 0:08:08| that have these larger houses already have them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=488)|
| 0:08:11| but there are these 1930s, 1940s neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=491)|
| 0:08:15| that were specifically designed in their origins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=495)|
| 0:08:18| to be added onto,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=498)|
| 0:08:20| and they're relatively small units right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=500)|
| 0:08:23| and then they have space to accommodate an addition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=503)|
| 0:08:27| say, to be converted into a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=507)|
| 0:08:30| So that kind of goes to that conversion side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=510)|
| 0:08:35| So in terms of the other side of precedent too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=515)|
| 0:08:39| I think the conversion aspect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=519)|
| 0:08:42| and the demolition conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=522)|
| 0:08:43| is something that y'all touched on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=523)|
| 0:08:45| and so this is really a major,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=525)|
| 0:08:47| has been a major topic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=527)|
| 0:08:48| in the historic preservation community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=528)|
| 0:08:50| how these historic neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=530)|
| 0:08:51| and how older houses can contribute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=531)|
| 0:08:53| to the nation's housing shortage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=533)|
| 0:08:55| and so this is just to indicate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=535)|
| 0:08:57| that these patterns already exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=537)|
| 0:08:59| Research study that reviewed a lot of research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=539)|
| 0:09:02| done by the National Trust for Historic Preservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=542)|
| 0:09:05| and then municipalities preservation nonprofits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=545)|
| 0:09:09| there was a study commissioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=549)|
| 0:09:10| by the Los Angeles Conservancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=550)|
| 0:09:12| that highlighted positive correlations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=552)|
| 0:09:14| between local historic districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=554)|
| 0:09:16| and then medium to higher density development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=556)|
| 0:09:19| Within the city of Los Angeles'| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=559)|
| 0:09:21| historic preservation overlay zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=561)|
| 0:09:23| 69% of their buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=563)|
| 0:09:25| provided more than one unit of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=565)|
| 0:09:28| So that's 69% of the historic districts in LA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=568)|
| 0:09:31| provide more than one unit of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=571)|
| 0:09:33| They're not just single family houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=573)|
| 0:09:35| and the report also found that in that city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=575)|
| 0:09:38| over 12,000 new housing units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=578)|
| 0:09:40| were created through adaptive reuse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=580)|
| 0:09:42| rehabilitation, and conversion of historic buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=582)|
| 0:09:45| during the last 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=585)|
| 0:09:46| so all buildings are part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=586)|
| 0:09:48| So Lindsay, when it happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=588)|
| 0:09:50| like take LA for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=590)|
| 0:09:52| are there existing homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=592)|
| 0:09:55| that are making these changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=595)|
| 0:09:57| to their residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=597)|
| 0:10:01| or are they commercial buyers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=601)|
| 0:10:03| or developers that are coming in and buying them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=603)|
| 0:10:05| and changing them and converting them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=605)|
| 0:10:08| holding on to them or selling them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=608)|
| 0:10:10| How is this process working?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=610)|
| 0:10:11| Well, I would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=611)|
| 0:10:12| and I can't speak specifically to Los Angeles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=612)|
| 0:10:15| or that specific answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=615)|
| 0:10:17| This was a relatively generalized study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=617)|
| 0:10:19| summarized by the National Trust,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=619)|
| 0:10:20| but I would say it's probably a mix of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=620)|
| 0:10:22| but I would also say in Los Angeles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=622)|
| 0:10:24| they have a different development pattern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=624)|
| 0:10:26| than we do here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=626)|
| 0:10:27| and that's probably what I was gonna hit next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=627)|
| 0:10:29| Those neighborhoods probably already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=629)|
| 0:10:31| had these types of middle housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=631)|
| 0:10:33| in their historic neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=633)|
| 0:10:36| and so it was easier for those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=636)|
| 0:10:38| they maybe were pre-existing middle housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=638)|
| 0:10:41| that have just always remained as duplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=641)|
| 0:10:43| tri-places, and quadplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=643)|
| 0:10:47| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=647)|
| 0:10:49| Yeah, I think that's just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=649)|
| 0:10:50| maybe it's hard to anticipate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=650)|
| 0:10:52| what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=652)|
| 0:10:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=653)|
| 0:10:54| But you think this is supposed to attach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=654)|
| 0:10:57| to tackle affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=657)|
| 0:10:59| and if you have this increased demand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=659)|
| 0:11:02| for developers to come in and raise prices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=662)|
| 0:11:04| and make changes to these houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=664)|
| 0:11:06| then you're really not accomplishing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=666)|
| 0:11:08| the goal that we're setting to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=668)|
| 0:11:10| Well, I wanna respond to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=670)|
| 0:11:13| but this is supposed to address affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=673)|
| 0:11:15| This is not an affordable housing strategy, per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=675)|
| 0:11:18| This is an opportunity to increase housing supply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=678)|
| 0:11:20| in a very incremental way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=680)|
| 0:11:22| what a lot of people refer to as gentle density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=682)|
| 0:11:25| over time, but it's not an affordable housing strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=685)|
| 0:11:29| There's no way to ensure that what will be built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=689)|
| 0:11:33| if this policy is passed would be affordable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=693)|
| 0:11:37| unless there's other incentives in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=697)|
| 0:11:39| to ensure that affordability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=699)|
| 0:11:42| Is that a possibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=702)|
| 0:11:44| I guess, I mean, part of the possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=704)|
| 0:11:46| is there will be new programs developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=706)|
| 0:11:48| but it's something that we can require,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=708)|
| 0:11:49| and we've been involved in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=709)|
| 0:11:51| You know, with respect to that, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=711)|
| 0:11:53| to your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=713)|
| 0:11:54| I don't think it's directly about affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=714)|
| 0:11:57| but I think it will help with a component| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=717)|
| 0:11:59| that's in more competition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=719)|
| 0:12:02| I mean, the more units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=722)|
| 0:12:03| we can get more units on the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=723)|
| 0:12:04| Just the basic supply and demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=724)|
| 0:12:05| Right, yeah, the more supply is out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=725)|
| 0:12:08| the less pressure pushing upwards on rents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=728)|
| 0:12:12| and pricing in homes, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=732)|
| 0:12:15| But that's the problem we've had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=735)|
| 0:12:17| is people are moving here, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=737)|
| 0:12:19| since 2008, we haven't had as much inventory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=739)|
| 0:12:23| hit the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=743)|
| 0:12:24| I mean, there's a lot of reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=744)|
| 0:12:25| banking, COVID, and there's a lot of increases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=745)|
| 0:12:28| but the more we increase any kind of inventory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=748)|
| 0:12:30| if it's missing middle or apartments or single family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=750)|
| 0:12:33| I mean, I think that pushes up the supply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=753)|
| 0:12:37| and eases up on pricing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=757)|
| 0:12:39| Well, thinking about the very first slide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=759)|
| 0:12:41| that Amy and Wendy showed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=761)|
| 0:12:43| which we've seen before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=763)|
| 0:12:44| but it shows that there's this bookend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=764)|
| 0:12:47| either have multi-family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=767)|
| 0:12:49| it is high-rise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=769)|
| 0:12:50| or you have single family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=770)|
| 0:12:51| and there's this whole middle block| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=771)|
| 0:12:53| that is just missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=773)|
| 0:12:54| And so it really is filling these different needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=774)|
| 0:12:58| or different stages of life and different needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=778)|
| 0:13:00| that's just hard to come by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=780)|
| 0:13:02| Yeah, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=782)|
| 0:13:03| I'm sold on the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=783)|
| 0:13:05| I'd like to see it expanded more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=785)|
| 0:13:07| even more, you know, in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=787)|
| 0:13:09| and possibly even in the town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=789)|
| 0:13:10| with the way the zoning codes work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=790)|
| 0:13:14| That's a really good segue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=794)|
| 0:13:18| That's a really good segue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=798)|
| 0:13:19| because after we talk about how it went missing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=799)|
| 0:13:22| we have why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=802)|
| 0:13:23| What are the benefits to this community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=803)|
| 0:13:25| So, real briefly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=805)|
| 0:13:26| I think when we've touched on this before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=806)|
| 0:13:28| we've sort of framed it up as,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=808)|
| 0:13:30| like what we're just discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=810)|
| 0:13:31| There are single-family houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=811)|
| 0:13:33| and there are large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=813)|
| 0:13:34| multi-unit apartment buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=814)|
| 0:13:35| but what we haven't really touched on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=815)|
| 0:13:37| is how and why,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=817)|
| 0:13:39| and that is basically the whole history of zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=819)|
| 0:13:41| So, when zoning was upheld in 1926| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=821)|
| 0:13:45| by the Supreme Court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=825)|
| 0:13:47| that basically separated single-family residential zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=827)|
| 0:13:52| from all other uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=832)|
| 0:13:54| And a specific part of that decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=834)|
| 0:13:56| recognized that dense housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=836)|
| 0:13:59| and very specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=839)|
| 0:14:00| it was apartment buildings at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=840)|
| 0:14:02| had the potential to be as much of a nuisance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=842)|
| 0:14:04| to single-family neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=844)|
| 0:14:06| as a factory or industrial use is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=846)|
| 0:14:08| So, single-family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=848)|
| 0:14:10| that Euclid versus Amber decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=850)|
| 0:14:13| which legalized and confirmed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=853)|
| 0:14:16| the appropriateness of different zoning in the nation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=856)|
| 0:14:20| which is a great thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=860)|
| 0:14:22| it also did sort of isolate single-family neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=862)|
| 0:14:25| as their own thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=865)|
| 0:14:27| So, that really made it challenging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=867)|
| 0:14:29| to build any additional units on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=869)|
| 0:14:32| In the 1930s, federal housing policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=872)|
| 0:14:35| was another aspect of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=875)|
| 0:14:37| Federal Housing Administration practices of the 1930s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=877)|
| 0:14:41| including redlining,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=881)|
| 0:14:43| which is something that has been brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=883)|
| 0:14:45| where the federal mortgage agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=885)|
| 0:14:47| would refuse to insure mortgages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| in and near black neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=889)|
| 0:14:51| This created a sort of financial separation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=891)|
| 0:14:54| but also physical separation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=894)|
| 0:14:56| of the types of neighborhoods that were constructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=896)|
| 0:14:58| Alongside these practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=898)|
| 0:15:00| they kind of went hand-in-hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=900)|
| 0:15:02| with just a general cultural triumph| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=902)|
| 0:15:04| towards the concept of the American Dream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=904)|
| 0:15:06| as a single-family house with a yard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=906)|
| 0:15:08| and a place to park your car when you got one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=908)|
| 0:15:10| So, there are a lot of factors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=910)|
| 0:15:12| that sort of led to that sort of middle form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=912)|
| 0:15:15| of housing going missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=915)|
| 0:15:17| We could talk about why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=917)|
| 0:15:19| we would want to incorporate these forms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=919)|
| 0:15:21| into NASA for a really long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=921)|
| 0:15:23| So, this slide has a lot of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=923)|
| 0:15:26| We could discuss this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=926)|
| 0:15:27| but one of the things that Commissioner Adams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=927)|
| 0:15:30| touched on was changing demographics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=930)|
| 0:15:32| and we have a lot of statistics that support these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=932)|
| 0:15:35| I would just back up and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| after this workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| we will send you guys some additional resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=939)|
| 0:15:41| We've got sort of a roundup| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=941)|
| 0:15:43| of various links and articles to read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=943)|
| 0:15:46| and we'll connect you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=946)|
| 0:15:48| with where all these came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=948)|
| 0:15:49| But a lot of this came from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=949)|
| 0:15:50| that East Tennessee Realtors State of Housing Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| So, a lot of this is specific to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=953)|
| 0:15:55| So, we talked about the statistic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=955)|
| 0:15:57| that currently 40.8% of Knoxville households| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=957)|
| 0:16:00| are single persons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=960)|
| 0:16:02| and then one in five of Knoxville residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=962)|
| 0:16:05| are age 65 years or older.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=965)|
| 0:16:07| Since early 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=967)|
| 0:16:08| Knoxville has had a positive net migration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=968)|
| 0:16:10| of approximately 22,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| So, not only do we have more people in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=973)|
| 0:16:16| but we have more households,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=976)|
| 0:16:18| and we have households of different composition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=978)|
| 0:16:20| from single families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=980)|
| 0:16:21| to families of people without children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=981)|
| 0:16:23| and that directly impacts housing demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=983)|
| 0:16:26| So, as the number of single person households,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=986)|
| 0:16:29| et cetera, increases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=989)|
| 0:16:31| there's gonna be a growing demand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=991)|
| 0:16:32| for smaller, less expensive housing options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=992)|
| 0:16:35| that cater to those living alone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=995)|
| 0:16:37| or couples,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=997)|
| 0:16:38| or options where people may wanna have a separate unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=998)|
| 0:16:41| or a relative, or a family member, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1001)|
| 0:16:45| We've also discussed, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1005)|
| 0:16:47| pretty extensively the housing options side of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1007)|
| 0:16:49| So, while it may not necessarily be affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1009)|
| 0:16:52| we are creating new options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1012)|
| 0:16:54| for smaller and more maintainable houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1014)|
| 0:16:57| and this is something that can provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1017)|
| 0:16:59| a pathway to homeownership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1019)|
| 0:17:00| if people can purchase a smaller unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| sort of build their wealth through that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| and sell that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1024)|
| 0:17:05| and then purchase something larger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1025)|
| 0:17:06| if that's what they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1026)|
| 0:17:07| This is something that can provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1027)|
| 0:17:08| a pathway to homeownership for folks in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1028)|
| 0:17:12| This increases rental options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1032)|
| 0:17:14| So, we have more small-scale mid-size family housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1034)|
| 0:17:18| So, people can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1038)|
| 0:17:19| there are more access to units to rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1039)|
| 0:17:22| in the neighborhoods where people wanna live in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1042)|
| 0:17:24| And then homeowners have the option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1044)|
| 0:17:26| to add units to generate passive income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| and support their own housing costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1049)|
| 0:17:31| There are a significant amount of environmental benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1051)|
| 0:17:34| and I can connect you guys with some studies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1054)|
| 0:17:36| but a 2010 EPA study noted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1056)|
| 0:17:39| that attached housing units use less electricity and water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1059)|
| 0:17:42| than detached housing units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1062)|
| 0:17:45| So, these smaller units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1065)|
| 0:17:46| are typically more energy efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1066)|
| 0:17:49| Also, obviously, they're being located in walkable units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1069)|
| 0:17:52| so having more housing in walkable neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1072)|
| 0:17:55| means that folks are going to drive less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1075)|
| 0:17:58| again, contributing less greenhouse gases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1078)|
| 0:18:00| It's a more sustainable form of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1080)|
| 0:18:02| Finally, this contributes to more residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1082)|
| 0:18:04| using public transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1084)|
| 0:18:06| which in turn will result in transit agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| providing more frequent service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1089)|
| 0:18:10| so that's less of a reliance on private vehicle usage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1090)|
| 0:18:13| So, there's the environmental aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1093)|
| 0:18:15| And finally, there's the equity aspect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1095)|
| 0:18:17| and that's what you can see in the chart on the bottom right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1097)|
| 0:18:19| This is from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1099)|
| 0:18:20| the East Tennessee Realtors Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1100)|
| 0:18:21| There are major racial disparities in homeownership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1101)|
| 0:18:25| and these are based on a number of factors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1105)|
| 0:18:27| from income inequality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1107)|
| 0:18:28| disparities in the mortgage market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1108)|
| 0:18:30| but then exclusionary zoning practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1110)|
| 0:18:33| And so, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1113)|
| 0:18:36| Something you said made me think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1116)|
| 0:18:38| some of the duplex-triplex options differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1118)|
| 0:18:41| I have, I think, always assumed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1121)|
| 0:18:43| that those would be rental scenarios,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| but that is not the case, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| That's not necessarily the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| So, there's nothing preventing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| again, I'm thinking about those historic farms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1132)|
| 0:18:55| It's a slide that we had to hold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1135)|
| 0:18:59| It's all correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1139)|
| 0:19:00| That those types of farms that exist currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1140)|
| 0:19:03| I've always thought of those as being rental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1143)|
| 0:19:04| so that if someone was to build a new one similar to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1144)|
| 0:19:08| that they would also be rental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| but that doesn't have to be a case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1150)|
| 0:19:11| They could be sold as individual units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1151)|
| 0:19:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1155)|
| 0:19:18| And to back to your point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1158)|
| 0:19:19| I was on a plane flying to Canada this summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1159)|
| 0:19:21| and there was a gentleman sitting next to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1161)|
| 0:19:23| and his son had just bought a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1163)|
| 0:19:25| In Canada, they have loser restrictions on zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1165)|
| 0:19:28| And his son purposely bought this duplex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1168)|
| 0:19:30| so he could live in one half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1170)|
| 0:19:32| rent out the other and support his mortgage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1172)|
| 0:19:34| which I thought was very smart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1174)|
| 0:19:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1176)|
| 0:19:41| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1181)|
| 0:19:43| Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1183)|
| 0:19:44| So, it's just additional options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1184)|
| 0:19:46| whether it's rental or homeownership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1186)|
| 0:19:49| and being able to split that is an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| I'm bringing that up because I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1191)|
| 0:19:54| I'll just go ahead and throw it out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1194)|
| 0:19:56| that there is a lot of resistance to these ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1196)|
| 0:20:00| because of the sense that there's transience in those forms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1200)|
| 0:20:05| because they're rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1205)|
| 0:20:06| So, there's an understanding that that's not necessarily the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1206)|
| 0:20:10| that these could be purchased on a balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1210)|
| 0:20:14| and that might also lower some of the resistance factors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1214)|
| 0:20:18| and fear factors about them all being rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1218)|
| 0:20:22| I would echo that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1222)|
| 0:20:23| I mean, just to back you up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1223)|
| 0:20:25| I bought a townhouse downtown in Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1225)|
| 0:20:27| I'm married.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1227)|
| 0:20:28| She's been my husband since I was a kid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1228)|
| 0:20:30| I want a place to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1230)|
| 0:20:31| It's people like me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1231)|
| 0:20:32| You don't want to buy a townhouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1232)|
| 0:20:35| And the cost would make them more saleable than rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1235)|
| 0:20:40| True.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1240)|
| 0:20:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1241)|
| 0:20:44| Is it possible to talk a little bit about board-based coding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1244)|
| 0:20:47| and have anything foreseeable future for this area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1247)|
| 0:20:52| We have two form-based codes in the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1252)|
| 0:20:55| on South Waterfront and Kendall Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1255)|
| 0:20:58| The code that we recently updated three years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1258)|
| 0:21:03| is what we consider a hybrid code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1263)|
| 0:21:05| So, there are elements of form-based in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1265)|
| 0:21:08| but it's not strictly form-based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1268)|
| 0:21:10| I mean, there is talk from time to time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1270)|
| 0:21:12| of pursuing a form-based code for certain parts of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1272)|
| 0:21:18| but there's not a lot of discussion about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1278)|
| 0:21:21| And I think that the little housing standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1281)|
| 0:21:24| draw from the concepts of form-based code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1284)|
| 0:21:28| So, the concept of a form-based code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1288)|
| 0:21:30| is regulating the building envelope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1290)|
| 0:21:32| and more design aspects than the uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1292)|
| 0:21:36| And so, we actually have a situation now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1296)|
| 0:21:39| where we are going to start reviewing buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1299)|
| 0:21:42| in these residential zonings by their building footprint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1302)|
| 0:21:45| so that there is integration from the form-based code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1305)|
| 0:21:47| that sort of works into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1307)|
| 0:21:56| So, we did want to give you guys the how,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1316)|
| 0:21:59| but what we want to do here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1319)|
| 0:22:01| is give more of a high-level review of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1321)|
| 0:22:04| since we got pretty granular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1324)|
| 0:22:06| during a general review in October| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| and we'll return in December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1328)|
| 0:22:10| and we'll go back to being granular again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1330)|
| 0:22:12| We'll really dig into the nuances of the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| So, I'm gonna go over it in a sort of high-level form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1335)|
| 0:22:18| but if folks have any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1338)|
| 0:22:20| about any of the details here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1340)|
| 0:22:22| we are happy to break those down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1342)|
| 0:22:24| and we can get into the details if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1344)|
| 0:22:26| But we were gonna give that sort of high-level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| so we can continue to have the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1348)|
| 0:22:30| to address some of the things that y'all asked for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1350)|
| 0:22:32| at the October Planning Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1352)|
| 0:22:34| So, how are we trying to allow new middle-housing forms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1354)|
| 0:22:39| in the city of Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1359)|
| 0:22:41| The proposal has a specific location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| as we've discussed pretty extensively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1363)|
| 0:22:45| the TDR land use area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1365)|
| 0:22:47| There are applicable zoning districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| and there are forms of housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1369)|
| 0:22:51| that are permitted in each of those zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| We have a section of types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1374)|
| 0:22:57| that we lay out the specific middle-housing forms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1377)|
| 0:23:00| Those are definitions that may differ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1380)|
| 0:23:02| from the base zoning code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1382)|
| 0:23:04| but the definition section in the zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1384)|
| 0:23:06| is gonna refer back to the middle-housing forms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| So, these will only apply to these specific projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1388)|
| 0:23:13| Types have an emphasis on height, scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1393)|
| 0:23:16| and design features.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1396)|
| 0:23:18| Then we have a uses section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1398)|
| 0:23:20| so that's sort of the chart that you can see on the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1400)|
| 0:23:23| We lay out which of the types are permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1403)|
| 0:23:26| based on the zoning districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1406)|
| 0:23:28| and their conformance to the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| And then we get into the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1410)|
| 0:23:33| So, there's a new table that establishes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| dimensional standards for middle-housing types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| It supersedes the dimensional standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| in table four, one of the residential codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| So, that's something that you're probably familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| Building coverage, impervious surface coverage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| setbacks, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| And the dimensional standards here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| regulate the forms by the minimum lot width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| So, we'll get back to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1434)|
| 0:23:56| when we discuss the testing that our staff have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1436)|
| 0:24:01| So, the minimum lot width,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1441)|
| 0:24:02| with or without an alley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1442)|
| 0:24:04| acknowledging that possibly for a driveway access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1444)|
| 0:24:07| There's a maximum building width and depth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1447)|
| 0:24:09| There's a setbacks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1449)|
| 0:24:11| and there's maximum height in stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1451)|
| 0:24:13| We have parking standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1453)|
| 0:24:15| and then there are design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1455)|
| 0:24:17| that are intended to guide the construction of new buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| that are similar in footprint, height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1460)|
| 0:24:22| and placement to the block,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1462)|
| 0:24:24| but allow for flexibility in design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| and generate visual interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1466)|
| 0:24:27| We're not trying to specifically prescribe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1467)|
| 0:24:30| what these houses should look like exactly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1470)|
| 0:24:32| but really the intent of the design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1472)|
| 0:24:34| is just that they are able to incorporate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| in the streetscape without being disproportionate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1477)|
| 0:24:39| or really stick out like a sore thumb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1479)|
| 0:24:43| So, the how in all of this is pretty specific,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| and it's tailored to the lots in the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1486)|
| 0:24:50| And we'll get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1490)|
| 0:24:51| I think we'll talk a little bit more about these standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1491)|
| 0:24:53| once we show you guys the results of the testing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1493)|
| 0:24:55| but is there anything on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1495)|
| 0:24:56| that anybody would like to know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1498)|
| 0:24:59| So, someone can buy two adjacent lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1499)|
| 0:25:02| and mine them to qualify for them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1502)|
| 0:25:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1506)|
| 0:25:07| Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1507)|
| 0:25:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1513)|
| 0:25:14| Other thoughts on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1514)|
| 0:25:15| We'll get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1515)|
| 0:25:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1518)|
| 0:25:19| So, another section of the code is conversions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1519)|
| 0:25:23| and this is one tactic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1523)|
| 0:25:25| that is intended to incentivize use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| of our existing housing stock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| So, standards, there are standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1529)|
| 0:25:31| that allow conversions of existing buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1531)|
| 0:25:34| to middle housing types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1534)|
| 0:25:35| via interior renovation or additions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1535)|
| 0:25:38| and the available types would correspond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1538)|
| 0:25:41| with Table 4.3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1541)|
| 0:25:42| so that's the permitted types in the zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1542)|
| 0:25:44| So, this is kind of the blanket summary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1544)|
| 0:25:46| that y'all have heard at a gender review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1546)|
| 0:25:48| in the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1548)|
| 0:25:49| I'll just kind of summarize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1549)|
| 0:25:51| These have design standards that are relatively simple,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1551)|
| 0:25:54| but they guide where the additions can be placed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1554)|
| 0:25:56| so you're not gonna have a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| where someone's building an addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1558)|
| 0:25:59| on the front of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1559)|
| 0:26:00| The additions are for the side and the rear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1560)|
| 0:26:02| Dormers can allow for additional height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1562)|
| 0:26:04| being a half story,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| but again, these design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1566)|
| 0:26:08| for additions would stress compatibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1568)|
| 0:26:10| in height and scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1570)|
| 0:26:12| And then, the framework we've given before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1572)|
| 0:26:15| I think it can be easier and quicker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1575)|
| 0:26:17| to build an addition than removing a house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| and constructing a new unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1579)|
| 0:26:21| It can be less expensive than building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1581)|
| 0:26:23| an entire new house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1583)|
| 0:26:24| and it's definitely more sustainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| So, the benefit here is that it conserves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| all that embodied energy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1589)|
| 0:26:30| and there's less construction waste going to a landfill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1590)|
| 0:26:33| That's sort of the why that we've discussed before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| but one thing we heard was a lot of discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1595)|
| 0:26:37| on this topic at the Planning Commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| and at Council Workshops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1599)|
| 0:26:40| and we did want to kind of unpack this further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1600)|
| 0:26:44| because we wanted to discuss it in a little more detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1604)|
| 0:26:47| So, some of the aspects of conversions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1607)|
| 0:26:50| Conversions are already permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1610)|
| 0:26:52| within the base zoning via the special use process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1612)|
| 0:26:56| but there are fewer design guardrails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1616)|
| 0:26:58| and there are more parking requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| So, for example, in the RN1 or the RN2 zoning district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1620)|
| 0:27:04| a property owner can already convert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1624)|
| 0:27:06| their single family house to a duplex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1626)|
| 0:27:09| but outside of the middle housing standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1629)|
| 0:27:12| they may be able to achieve this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1632)|
| 0:27:14| through means that are less compatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1634)|
| 0:27:16| with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1636)|
| 0:27:17| So, they could have a one story house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1637)|
| 0:27:18| like that minimal traditional I showed in the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1638)|
| 0:27:20| and build a two story addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| that sort of towers over it on the rear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1642)|
| 0:27:25| or other elements that are somewhat incompatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1645)|
| 0:27:28| with the streetscape,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1648)|
| 0:27:29| and then they would also be required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1649)|
| 0:27:30| to add at least two parking spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| and then that would be four parking spaces on that site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1652)|
| 0:27:35| which is a lot of pavement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1655)|
| 0:27:37| and generally going to make these projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| a lot more difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| The other element that I think Adam was going to hit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| originally the Historic Preservation Planner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| is the concept of conversions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1668)|
| 0:27:49| is now officially supported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1669)|
| 0:27:51| by federal historic preservation policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1671)|
| 0:27:53| So, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1673)|
| 0:27:56| is the federal agency that oversees historic preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1676)|
| 0:28:00| They released a policy statement in September| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1680)|
| 0:28:04| on housing and historic preservation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1684)|
| 0:28:05| how historic neighborhoods could support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| the housing crisis that our nation has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1687)|
| 0:28:10| and they very specifically referenced this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| in policy statement four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1692)|
| 0:28:13| so they say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1693)|
| 0:28:14| public serving institutions should promote zoning codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1694)|
| 0:28:17| that encourage greater density of housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1697)|
| 0:28:19| in tandem with preserving historic buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1699)|
| 0:28:21| and legalize housing in historic neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1701)|
| 0:28:24| where it's now limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1704)|
| 0:28:25| Many zoning codes were put into place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1705)|
| 0:28:27| at a time when urban density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| was all too often a negative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1708)|
| 0:28:29| and something to be legislated against,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1709)|
| 0:28:31| but increasing density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1711)|
| 0:28:33| in existing residential neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1713)|
| 0:28:35| is a potential solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1715)|
| 0:28:36| to address the shortfall in housing supply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| and changes should be seriously explored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1718)|
| 0:28:42| And then they say, real specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1722)|
| 0:28:43| consideration should be given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1723)|
| 0:28:45| to allowing and incentivizing density without demolition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1725)|
| 0:28:49| through conversion of historic single family dwellings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1729)|
| 0:28:51| to multifamily dwellings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| and then they also acknowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1733)|
| 0:28:54| the need for compatible infill construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| of multifamily housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1737)|
| 0:28:58| on vacant parcels in historic district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| So, I think this is important to hit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| because there are, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| people have concerns about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1744)|
| 0:29:05| the effect on historic neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1745)|
| 0:29:07| but this overarching historic preservation policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1747)|
| 0:29:09| from the federal to the non-profit end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| really supports this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1751)|
| 0:29:12| recognizes that these neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| are supported to these forms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1754)|
| 0:29:16| Another point is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| some of these conversions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| that have already been completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1760)|
| 0:29:21| in the early to mid-20th century| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1761)|
| 0:29:23| contributed to the preservation of historic houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1763)|
| 0:29:26| and not so effectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1766)|
| 0:29:27| This was a point that a Park Ridge resident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1767)|
| 0:29:30| shared with Cheryl,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1770)|
| 0:29:31| and she was with someone from Knox Heritage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| they said, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1773)|
| 0:29:34| some of the houses in the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1774)|
| 0:29:35| probably wouldn't have made it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1775)|
| 0:29:38| had they not been able to hold multiple units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| at some point in their history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1780)|
| 0:29:41| So, I have an image of Fort Sanders on the screen here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1781)|
| 0:29:44| which I know sometimes is a challenging example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1784)|
| 0:29:47| because it can be a dusty situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| but it's indicative of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1789)|
| 0:29:50| So, from the 1910s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| when actually my great-great-grandmother| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1792)|
| 0:29:54| had a house on Louisville Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1794)|
| 0:29:56| she rented out individual rooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1796)|
| 0:29:57| as a boarding house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1797)|
| 0:29:58| to the 1980s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1798)|
| 0:30:00| when we wildly overestimated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1800)|
| 0:30:02| the people that were gonna come for the World's Fair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1802)|
| 0:30:04| and we cut this up into apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1804)|
| 0:30:05| The fact that a lot of these houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1805)|
| 0:30:07| are able to still exist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1807)|
| 0:30:09| because we could change the insides of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1809)|
| 0:30:11| to accommodate additional housing units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1811)|
| 0:30:14| However, on the flip side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1814)|
| 0:30:17| now we're working with contemporary building codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1817)|
| 0:30:19| so we have that benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1819)|
| 0:30:20| This is going to ensure safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1820)|
| 0:30:23| as opposed to the haphazard sort of cut-up apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| that I think a lot of us would envision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| when we think about the things particularly done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1828)|
| 0:30:30| in the 70s and 80s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1830)|
| 0:30:32| But they'll ensure safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1832)|
| 0:30:36| require separation requirements and duplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| sprinklers and triplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1838)|
| 0:30:41| and accessibility requirements and quadplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1841)|
| 0:30:43| and we have additional research completed on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| Brian has sort of done a survey of the codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1846)|
| 0:30:48| and we can kind of talk about this further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1848)|
| 0:30:50| if people have concerns about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| But the point here is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1852)|
| 0:30:54| these new building codes that we're working with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| they also may make conversions challenging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| and somewhat cost-prohibitive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1858)|
| 0:31:00| if you're stepping up a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1860)|
| 0:31:02| Someone would really have to work pretty hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1862)|
| 0:31:05| to accommodate a triplex or a quadplex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1865)|
| 0:31:07| in one of these single-family houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1867)|
| 0:31:08| just because they will have to sprinkler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| provide accessibility requirements, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1870)|
| 0:31:13| So that's safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1873)|
| 0:31:14| and it's also sort of a protection part right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| Does anybody have thoughts or questions on conversions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| Well, I think that was one of the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| at least I think it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1884)|
| 0:31:25| they were out of Fort Sanders and Fort McNeil areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| At the meeting, they were upset about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1888)|
| 0:31:31| they were okay with building new ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1891)|
| 0:31:34| but where they were having a rub was the conversions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1894)|
| 0:31:37| And I'm just going by memory here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| but I think they were saying that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1899)|
| 0:31:42| gosh, we just converted them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1902)|
| 0:31:44| two single-family away from the density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1904)|
| 0:31:47| and they felt like that was better for the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1907)|
| 0:31:50| And now you're kind of wanting to go back to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| And I'm not saying I'm for it or against it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| I'm just saying that's sort of feedback, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| at the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1917)|
| 0:31:58| one of the reasons it got slowed down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1918)|
| 0:32:00| I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1920)|
| 0:32:01| so I just voted that for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1921)|
| 0:32:04| Well, I appreciate what Lindsay said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1924)|
| 0:32:06| about the kind of political perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1926)|
| 0:32:08| that these houses wouldn't even exist today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1928)|
| 0:32:11| had they not had the chock-a-block sort of treatment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1931)|
| 0:32:16| that was terrible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1936)|
| 0:32:17| but it actually meant that the structure remained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1937)|
| 0:32:21| I hadn't thought about it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1941)|
| 0:32:24| And the fact that you were saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1944)|
| 0:32:28| it's going to work really hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1948)|
| 0:32:30| to get to a triplex or quadruplex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1950)|
| 0:32:33| with all the sprinkler and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1953)|
| 0:32:35| that, too, I think is a mitigating factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| A duplex seems a lot less intense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1958)|
| 0:32:40| I would think, for a fourth of Gil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1960)|
| 0:32:42| or something beyond that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| because you might even have to have the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1965)|
| 0:32:49| I know there are guidelines here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1969)|
| 0:32:51| to add a half-story or something to that nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1971)|
| 0:32:54| to get what you needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1974)|
| 0:32:56| I just question, when we were talking about it in that meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1976)|
| 0:33:01| how much the neighbors that were bringing up those issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1981)|
| 0:33:05| understood about these two ideas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1985)|
| 0:33:08| the increased safety codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1988)|
| 0:33:11| and then that the buildings are still here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1991)|
| 0:33:14| because of some of those activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1994)|
| 0:33:17| At least in student housing, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| you're seeing a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=1999)|
| 0:33:20| Everything is ran by the roof now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2000)|
| 0:33:22| It's not even like...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| You've got a three-veteran, two-guy home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2004)|
| 0:33:27| standard West Knoxville kind of Knox boxy thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2007)|
| 0:33:30| But especially in these areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2010)|
| 0:33:32| they just chop them up inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2012)|
| 0:33:35| They'll have one kitchen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2015)|
| 0:33:36| and they can rent these things for $1,000 or $1,500 per room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2016)|
| 0:33:41| So I don't know what that is considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2021)|
| 0:33:44| Is it still considered one house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2024)|
| 0:33:47| I don't know how that's viewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2027)|
| 0:33:50| And also, a question about that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2030)|
| 0:33:53| We've had a lot of discussions about ADUs lately as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2033)|
| 0:33:58| Can you do both?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2038)|
| 0:33:59| Can you do the duplex in front and put an ADU in the back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2039)|
| 0:34:02| Or three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2042)|
| 0:34:04| Just think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2044)|
| 0:34:07| I mean, I can think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| It's like, oh, we just converted these back to single-family residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| We just got to restore it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| Why is that good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| I mean, what was wrong with multi-unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2057)|
| 0:34:21| single-family converted houses to begin with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| I don't think there's anything wrong with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2064)|
| 0:34:26| I think it's a part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| The perception of we just fixed it back to the single-family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2068)|
| 0:34:31| I think, is kind of flawed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2071)|
| 0:34:34| Because the entire...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| Take Fort McGill, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2076)|
| 0:34:38| The deterioration of those homes on the exterior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2078)|
| 0:34:41| isn't because they were multi-family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| There were wider economic trends hitting inner-city areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2083)|
| 0:34:48| with the interstate being disrupted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| It wasn't because they were multi-family that they deteriorated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2090)|
| 0:34:54| It was other economic forces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| I would argue that the resistance of, oh, they can be converted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2096)|
| 0:35:00| and then they're going to become dilapidated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| is really just not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| I think it feeds into the transience factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| That sentiment that was articulated about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2107)|
| 0:35:12| oh, now it's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| That it wasn't as much about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2114)|
| 0:35:17| now it's single-family, therefore not bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2117)|
| 0:35:21| But it's single-family, so someone is invested here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2121)|
| 0:35:24| and is going to stay here and keep it this way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| as opposed to if it's owned by one person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2126)|
| 0:35:30| who's a distant landlord,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| and they're not concerned about the welfare of the students there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2132)|
| 0:35:36| That's what they move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| I didn't take it to mean that it had to be single-family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| to be good, but I took it to mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| that's the only safety mechanism that the neighborhood has had success with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2142)|
| 0:35:46| in having a home be restorative care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2146)|
| 0:35:49| I think we're just dealing with the impotent reality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2149)|
| 0:35:52| that people's perception of multi-family homes in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2152)|
| 0:35:55| while the Fort is a great example of what can be done with historic homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2155)|
| 0:35:59| anybody from Fort McGill, Old North, looking at the Fort is going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2159)|
| 0:36:02| oh, God, I don't want that to be my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2162)|
| 0:36:05| I think we just have to deal with the reality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2165)|
| 0:36:08| that people automatically associate that kind of construction with the Fort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2168)|
| 0:36:12| which is what it is, and it's great for UT, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| but it's not going to work everywhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2174)|
| 0:36:16| but it's not going to be that way everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| But I think that's people's mindset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| If you go through the Fort now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2180)|
| 0:36:22| and you have John Holmes that's fixed how many properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2182)|
| 0:36:25| that are multi-family that are in historic homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2185)|
| 0:36:28| I think that's from the exterior,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| that's going to be able to go in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| and there are a lot of units in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| I think the number of bedrooms is different than what we're talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2195)|
| 0:36:46| Cutting off a house and adding additional bedrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2206)|
| 0:36:48| is not what we would refer to as middle housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2208)|
| 0:36:51| There's a distinction there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| I don't believe the Fort is the best example of what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2213)|
| 0:36:58| I think it also, going back to it's missing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2218)|
| 0:37:01| we don't have a lot of great examples of what this looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2221)|
| 0:37:07| I think the idea, if I may interject a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2227)|
| 0:37:10| with conversions is that there would be individual fully housed units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2230)|
| 0:37:17| It wouldn't be specifically rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2237)|
| 0:37:21| We wouldn't allow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| It would have to be its own contained specific unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2243)|
| 0:37:27| i.e. back in the kitchen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| It doesn't have to have multiple bedrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| it could be an efficiency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| but it would be its own unit versus individual rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2254)|
| 0:37:39| Yes, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2259)|
| 0:37:47| Amy's going to touch on some process aspects now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2267)|
| 0:37:51| which I think is another topic that we got pretty into in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2271)|
| 0:37:57| I think it's important to note that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2277)|
| 0:38:01| using the proposed middle housing standards is voluntary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2281)|
| 0:38:05| In all the zoning districts covered by the middle housing standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2285)|
| 0:38:09| applicants may opt instead to follow the base zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2289)|
| 0:38:13| and the special use review process that might apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2293)|
| 0:38:17| Administrative variations provide relief from standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2297)|
| 0:38:20| due to existing conditions on the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2300)|
| 0:38:23| provided that all the other standards are met,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| such as lot size, quarter size, setbacks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2305)|
| 0:38:28| design standards that can achieve creative design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2308)|
| 0:38:33| Previous iterations of the code did not permit variances under Article 16.3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2313)|
| 0:38:39| to the middle housing section of the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| The revised proposal to be heard at a December meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2321)|
| 0:38:44| will allow consideration of variances related to parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2324)|
| 0:38:48| We've heard a lot of discussion around parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2328)|
| 0:38:50| no challenges associated with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2330)|
| 0:38:52| Can you say that again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2332)|
| 0:38:54| Previous iterations of the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| the one that's currently before you, Paul,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2336)|
| 0:38:59| did not permit any variances under Article 16.3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2339)|
| 0:39:04| That was just because of the BZA process being removed or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2344)|
| 0:39:09| It was to allow for...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| Because this is optional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| This is not required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| You don't have to pursue the middle housing standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2355)|
| 0:39:19| You can always just utilize the base zone standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2359)|
| 0:39:24| Pursuing this other option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2364)|
| 0:39:26| there's additional standards that fall into place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2366)|
| 0:39:28| The bar is set a little bit higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| if you want to add creative flex on your lot or track legs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2370)|
| 0:39:35| The bar is set higher if you do the middle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2375)|
| 0:39:38| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| But doesn't it seem like it's looser with the landscape buffer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2380)|
| 0:39:46| It's allowing more options for property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2386)|
| 0:39:51| to utilize their property in different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2391)|
| 0:39:55| But when they move forward with, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2395)|
| 0:39:58| construction of hypothetically a new structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2398)|
| 0:40:02| such as a duplex in this TDR area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2402)|
| 0:40:06| if they follow this middle housing design process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2406)|
| 0:40:11| middle housing process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2411)|
| 0:40:13| and they have design and dimensional standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2413)|
| 0:40:15| that don't specifically exist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2415)|
| 0:40:18| it is a little bit more...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2418)|
| 0:40:20| What the product would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| would actually potentially have to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2422)|
| 0:40:26| a little bit more review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2429)|
| 0:40:30| For instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2430)|
| 0:40:32| Lindsay and I touched on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2432)|
| 0:40:34| but there's more emphasis on the height, the scale, the design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2434)|
| 0:40:37| the compatibility with the surrounding neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2437)|
| 0:40:40| those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2440)|
| 0:40:42| Building width and depth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2442)|
| 0:40:43| which is something that we do not typically regulate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2443)|
| 0:40:47| in just building a duplex in the RN2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2447)|
| 0:40:50| or through the existing special use process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| There are not guardrails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| Well, there are in terms of setbacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| and building coverage and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| but the dimensional standards also regulate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| the footprints of the houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2461)|
| 0:41:03| the maximum footprint of the house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| so dwelling that can be built on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2465)|
| 0:41:08| So, going back to middle housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2468)|
| 0:41:11| it's intended to be house-scale buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2471)|
| 0:41:14| and so these standards are designed to ensure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2474)|
| 0:41:16| that they remain house-scale buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2476)|
| 0:41:18| There's lots of places that you can build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2478)|
| 0:41:20| a multi-unit building that would be out of context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2480)|
| 0:41:24| That's not the intent of the middle housing standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2484)|
| 0:41:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2486)|
| 0:41:27| This is one thing that may need to be cleared out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2487)|
| 0:41:31| We don't have a lot of good examples of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| Like, we're struggling here to point to something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2493)|
| 0:41:36| that is really an apples-to-an-apple,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2496)|
| 0:41:38| and we have examples that are not brain-like procedures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2498)|
| 0:41:41| and I think that is one reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2501)|
| 0:41:44| why the current designation of the TDR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2504)|
| 0:41:49| for this image makes a lot of sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2509)|
| 0:41:53| because it has to be able to see good examples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2513)|
| 0:41:57| so that it can grow from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2517)|
| 0:41:59| To me, that seems like a good rationale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2519)|
| 0:42:01| for why there's been a border drawn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2521)|
| 0:42:04| as opposed to just going ahead to the entire city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2524)|
| 0:42:09| because people just don't understand what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2529)|
| 0:42:12| We've got some good examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2532)|
| 0:42:18| So I want to touch on appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2538)|
| 0:42:21| Is any person, and you all know this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2541)|
| 0:42:24| but any person can appeal a planning staff decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2544)|
| 0:42:28| to this body, and then any decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2548)|
| 0:42:31| that the planning commission makes is appealable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| So if it's in the city, it's gonna be appealable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| to city council, and if it's in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2555)|
| 0:42:38| it will be either appealable to the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2558)|
| 0:42:40| or the BCA, so I just wanted to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2560)|
| 0:42:43| So there are different steps, checks and balances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2563)|
| 0:42:47| that will not go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2567)|
| 0:42:50| Planning staff, if this is passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2570)|
| 0:42:52| will take the lead on development review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2572)|
| 0:42:55| of projects that take advantage of the rental housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2575)|
| 0:42:59| We have precedent for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| for how we run reviews for E-Inn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2581)|
| 0:43:04| established neighborhoods, downtown Knoxville Edge District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2584)|
| 0:43:08| the R-4 zoning districts, along with the design review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2588)|
| 0:43:11| of the district zoning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2591)|
| 0:43:13| as well as in-built housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2593)|
| 0:43:16| We'll have a standard application form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2596)|
| 0:43:18| and require supporting documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2598)|
| 0:43:21| We will provide ongoing staff assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| I won't say that we do that for any projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2603)|
| 0:43:25| but again, specifically for things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| that have additional standards in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| we want to make sure that we make the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| as easy as possible and both the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2612)|
| 0:43:34| and the community members understand what's happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2614)|
| 0:43:37| and what's allowed and what's not allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2617)|
| 0:43:40| We'll provide public notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| and then we also are committed to making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2622)|
| 0:43:44| to, Commissioner Adams' point, collecting data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2624)|
| 0:43:47| and monitoring this over time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2627)|
| 0:43:50| see what the impacts are, the effects are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2630)|
| 0:43:52| and if it does make sense to potentially expand it further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2632)|
| 0:43:59| Any questions about the process as proposed currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2639)|
| 0:44:06| Are you gonna talk about VZAs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| Is there something they weren't allowed to do with VZAs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2648)|
| 0:44:13| Yes, so for the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2653)|
| 0:44:16| The variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2656)|
| 0:44:17| The variances, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| There's what we call administrative variations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2659)|
| 0:44:21| which can be related to the standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| based on existing conditions of the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| but in terms of varying...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2665)|
| 0:44:32| It's not like you can go in and ask for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2672)|
| 0:44:35| and I might ask Christina to jump in on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2675)|
| 0:44:38| The intent is, you can, this is an optional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| so if this doesn't work for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| say the site's not big enough for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| to do a duplex or a triplex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| this is not intended to just allow you to go to a VZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2687)|
| 0:44:50| and say, we still want to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2690)|
| 0:44:52| Well, you can, you probably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2692)|
| 0:44:53| you might be able to do that with a VZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2693)|
| 0:44:54| so that would be the default.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2694)|
| 0:44:56| You still are allowed to utilize your property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2696)|
| 0:44:58| without requesting a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| The one thing that we are proposing to add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2700)|
| 0:45:02| is variances for parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| because we know that's a significant challenge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| in particular in our older neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2706)|
| 0:45:08| of providing accommodation for required parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2708)|
| 0:45:11| due to some constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| So that would be like a setback, for example?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| So if the setback is five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| and you want to do missing middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| a quadplex, let's say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2719)|
| 0:45:21| and you're like, oh, my hardship is the lot is too narrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2721)|
| 0:45:25| you can't request a variance of like two for the setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2725)|
| 0:45:29| Not two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2729)|
| 0:45:30| Yes, this particular development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2730)|
| 0:45:33| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2733)|
| 0:45:34| We don't want the variances to become something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| that people use to increase density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2736)|
| 0:45:39| or like you said, go farther into a setback requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2739)|
| 0:45:44| which may become out of context with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2744)|
| 0:45:48| That's the main concern there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2748)|
| 0:45:49| And so that's why, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2749)|
| 0:45:51| with the middle housing standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2751)|
| 0:45:54| and dimensional requirements that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| just like Amy said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2756)|
| 0:45:57| you can use those for middle housing developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2757)|
| 0:46:00| and that's how we're going to encourage it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2760)|
| 0:46:01| because there's a little bit more leeway there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| But if that doesn't work for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| you still have the option of just going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2766)|
| 0:46:08| with the base dimensional requirements and standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2768)|
| 0:46:11| We just don't want there to be a way around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| the higher level of flexibility, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2774)|
| 0:46:19| for lack of a better word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2779)|
| 0:46:20| that the middle housing standards provide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2780)|
| 0:46:23| by going even farther to get the variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2783)|
| 0:46:26| and take it more to an extreme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2786)|
| 0:46:28| We're trying to get away from those, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2788)|

| 0:46:33| We're trying to stay in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| Yeah, so creating structures that again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2795)|
| 0:46:38| are not house scale buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2798)|
| 0:46:40| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2800)|
| 0:46:41| Say you wanted to build something that is a building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| you're like, you know, I can't make, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2803)|
| 0:46:47| I can't pull a number up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2807)|
| 0:46:48| I can't make a 35 foot wide building work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2808)|
| 0:46:51| or a 40 foot wide duplex, 45 foot wide four blocks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2811)|
| 0:46:56| I need it to be 55 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2816)|
| 0:46:58| What we're trying, they couldn't go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| So again, that's, they could not go to TCA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2821)|
| 0:47:04| to increase the scale that we have set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2824)|
| 0:47:06| in these dimensional standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| But they could go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2828)|
| 0:47:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2834)|
| 0:47:16| Can you explain a couple times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2836)|
| 0:47:20| that they could use their property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2840)|
| 0:47:23| So they, using the general code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2843)|
| 0:47:28| Under the base zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2848)|
| 0:47:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2849)|
| 0:47:30| Right, so they can do whatever is allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2850)|
| 0:47:33| in the base zone according to the uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| and the dimensional requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| and all those standards that are included there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| They can still opt for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| because the zoning hasn't changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2861)|
| 0:47:44| We're just saying that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2864)|
| 0:47:45| if you are in the TDR area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2865)|
| 0:47:48| and you have a lot that accommodates this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2868)|
| 0:47:51| and you can meet all the requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2871)|
| 0:47:53| in the middle housing code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2873)|
| 0:47:54| you could do that if you wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2874)|
| 0:47:57| But you have the option either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2877)|
| 0:48:03| Sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2883)|
| 0:48:09| We also want to provide an opportunity to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2889)|
| 0:48:15| to address the concerns and feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2895)|
| 0:48:17| provided that October planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2897)|
| 0:48:20| related to outreach and engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2900)|
| 0:48:24| So I'm gonna run through a few slides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2904)|
| 0:48:27| As I mentioned, Cheryl's here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2907)|
| 0:48:29| and her office has been leading the public engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2909)|
| 0:48:33| And I want to touch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2913)|
| 0:48:34| kind of go back a little bit further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2914)|
| 0:48:36| to before this started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2916)|
| 0:48:37| before we had these standards drafted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2917)|
| 0:48:39| As you all remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2919)|
| 0:48:40| back in September of 2022,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2920)|
| 0:48:43| OPTICOS, the consultant that we hired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2923)|
| 0:48:48| it was just a collaboration between the planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2928)|
| 0:48:50| the East End State Real Estate Association, and the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2930)|
| 0:48:53| came in and did what was called a middle housing scam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2933)|
| 0:48:55| Just looked at our code and our plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2935)|
| 0:48:58| and provided some recommendations for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2938)|
| 0:49:00| In October, we had a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2940)|
| 0:49:03| We presented at your agenda review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2943)|
| 0:49:06| an overview of that scam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2946)|
| 0:49:09| We had representatives from OPTICOS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2949)|
| 0:49:11| at the agenda review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2951)|
| 0:49:13| And then there was also, in the spring, in March,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2953)|
| 0:49:16| there were two workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2956)|
| 0:49:18| There was one at the East End State Realtors Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| that also included OPTICOS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2960)|
| 0:49:22| And then there was a city council workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2962)|
| 0:49:24| That's where the formal proposal was given to staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2964)|
| 0:49:28| to pursue standards for middle housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2968)|
| 0:49:32| and how that would apply in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2972)|
| 0:49:35| In September of this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2975)|
| 0:49:36| we had a city council workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| And then, of course, today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| There's been a number of meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| Neighborhood Association, Farm Profits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2982)|
| 0:49:44| There's been a number of one-on-one meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2984)|
| 0:49:46| that Ms. Paul and her team have undertaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2986)|
| 0:49:48| And there's two community open houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2988)|
| 0:49:51| which I know some of you attended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2991)|
| 0:49:52| There are quite a few people who came out for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2992)|
| 0:49:55| around 250 folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2995)|
| 0:49:57| These are some additional groups and organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2997)|
| 0:49:59| that have been engaged throughout this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=2999)|
| 0:50:04| And these are some neighborhood meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| And Cheryl, I don't know if there's anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3006)|
| 0:50:07| you want to touch on here or provide an overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3007)|
| 0:50:10| I would be happy to take questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3010)|
| 0:50:11| I attended almost all of these myself, personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3011)|
| 0:50:14| There's a couple that I had to divide and conquer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3014)|
| 0:50:18| at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3018)|
| 0:50:19| But for the most part, I have attended all of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3019)|
| 0:50:24| We do continue to have folks reach out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3024)|
| 0:50:26| to the mayor's office and my office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3026)|
| 0:50:29| to ask questions, wanting clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3029)|
| 0:50:33| They want to know, how does this affect my property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3033)|
| 0:50:37| How does this affect my neighbor's property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3037)|
| 0:50:39| And how does it affect my neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3039)|
| 0:50:41| And those are the three things that they most want to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3041)|
| 0:50:44| And those are very individualized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3044)|
| 0:50:47| engagement opportunities that we take very seriously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3047)|
| 0:50:51| and have attempted to make sure we're giving everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3051)|
| 0:50:54| the answers to the questions that they're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3054)|
| 0:50:57| Most of the time, they're satisfied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3057)|
| 0:51:00| But as you all are very aware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3060)|
| 0:51:02| some people don't like the answer that they get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3062)|
| 0:51:06| But for the most part, folks are really pleased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3066)|
| 0:51:11| to see that this is being methodical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| that we work with the planning staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| to be intentional about the approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3075)|
| 0:51:17| that we've taken with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3077)|
| 0:51:18| And for the most part, they applaud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3078)|
| 0:51:22| It was a very small meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3082)|
| 0:51:24| On Monday night, they applauded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3084)|
| 0:51:27| It was like 15 people there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3087)|
| 0:51:30| And they were like, yay!| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3090)|
| 0:51:33| But I mean, it's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3093)|
| 0:51:35| It's very exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3095)|
| 0:51:36| This was a group of neighborhoods in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3096)|
| 0:51:39| And they were really pleased about the approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3099)|
| 0:51:42| that we've taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3102)|
| 0:51:43| So I'll be happy to entertain any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3103)|
| 0:51:45| that you all have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3105)|
| 0:51:47| Any questions or comments about the community outreach?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3107)|
| 0:51:50| Again, that came up as a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3110)|
| 0:51:52| during the planning commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3112)|
| 0:51:54| There was interest in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3114)|
| 0:51:56| The team continued to do more outreach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3116)|
| 0:51:59| Cheryl, in your meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3119)|
| 0:52:02| you know, people are scared of change often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3122)|
| 0:52:07| So have they ever brought up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3127)|
| 0:52:10| or have you discussed with them other options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| that could help what they would see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3132)|
| 0:52:14| as protect the integrity of their neighborhoods?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3134)|
| 0:52:16| Like expand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3136)|
| 0:52:17| Were you asking them to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3137)|
| 0:52:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3138)|
| 0:52:19| But like adding new neighborhood conservation overlays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3139)|
| 0:52:23| or historic overlays?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3143)|
| 0:52:26| They should see newer neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3146)|
| 0:52:28| that are a little more organized and savvy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3148)|
| 0:52:33| with understanding zoning and use, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3153)|
| 0:52:38| They have, there have been people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3158)|
| 0:52:40| that have had some conversation about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| do we need to pursue this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| What will be the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| I have handed out Lindsay's name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3166)|
| 0:52:49| and email address more than once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3169)|
| 0:52:51| as a great resource to support them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3171)|
| 0:52:54| But also have had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3174)|
| 0:52:59| making sure that if their neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3179)|
| 0:53:02| is gonna take it on to do something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| because that is a pretty significant undertaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3184)|
| 0:53:07| to really make sure that they understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3187)|
| 0:53:10| and Lindsay is great about helping them understand this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3190)|
| 0:53:13| but since I have the opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3193)|
| 0:53:16| sometimes in that moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3196)|
| 0:53:18| with a group of people to send that message| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3198)|
| 0:53:22| is let's talk with your city council representative as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3202)|
| 0:53:26| Let's bring that person into the fold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3206)|
| 0:53:28| and the process as you initiate having these conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3208)|
| 0:53:33| And so far, I don't know if anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3213)|
| 0:53:35| is actually pursuing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3215)|
| 0:53:36| I don't think Lindsay's received any calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3216)|
| 0:53:38| that I'm trying to make sure that they do understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3218)|
| 0:53:41| there is a process that they can go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3221)|
| 0:53:44| to create a development of protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3224)|
| 0:53:47| if that's something that they decide to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3227)|
| 0:53:50| I actually would clarify to the early person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3230)|
| 0:53:52| from your commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3232)|
| 0:53:53| but they know what they had asked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3233)|
| 0:53:55| was additional design review protections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3235)|
| 0:53:58| So like in historic district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3238)|
| 0:53:59| or neighborhood conservation overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3239)|
| 0:54:01| which some people may think about change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3241)|
| 0:54:05| and new buildings being built on vacant lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3245)|
| 0:54:07| and think is there more that can be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3247)|
| 0:54:10| to review how they look at their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3250)|
| 0:54:12| So that's what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3252)|
| 0:54:16| Any other questions or comments about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3256)|
| 0:54:20| Thank you, Sharon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3260)|
| 0:54:21| I'm going to turn it over to Lindsay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3261)|
| 0:54:23| So I guess my only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3263)|
| 0:54:25| I really like this idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3265)|
| 0:54:27| I don't know if I have a warranty committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3267)|
| 0:54:29| but the one discussion about demolishing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3269)|
| 0:54:33| a couple of houses in order to accomplish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3273)|
| 0:54:36| a larger scale legal housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3276)|
| 0:54:38| like maybe they,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3278)|
| 0:54:41| how does that happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3281)|
| 0:54:43| Would they,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3283)|
| 0:54:44| they would have to buy two lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3284)|
| 0:54:46| They would have to go through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3286)|
| 0:54:48| And this is someone who doesn't have an overlay, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3288)|
| 0:54:51| The kind of overlay they couldn't demolish?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3291)|
| 0:54:54| So properties that have a historic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3294)|
| 0:54:59| or a neighborhood conservation overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3299)|
| 0:55:02| demolition is reviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3302)|
| 0:55:03| by the historic zoning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3303)|
| 0:55:06| And I will say that folks proposing the demolition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3306)|
| 0:55:09| are expected to provide a substantial amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3309)|
| 0:55:13| of information to support why they could not retain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3313)|
| 0:55:15| and preserve that house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3315)|
| 0:55:16| And I can give you so many examples,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3316)|
| 0:55:18| including when the city most recently proposed a demolition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3318)|
| 0:55:21| The historic zoning commission said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3321)|
| 0:55:23| So that's where the demolition review comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3323)|
| 0:55:27| Properties that are in the infill housing overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| do not have a demolition review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3329)|
| 0:55:31| as part of that process right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3331)|
| 0:55:33| We have another form of guardrail for demolition review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3333)|
| 0:55:39| The historic preservation planner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3339)|
| 0:55:42| is the title reference in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3342)|
| 0:55:44| Review every demolition permit that's pulled in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3344)|
| 0:55:47| for historic significance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3347)|
| 0:55:49| And there is a 60 day delay of demolition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3349)|
| 0:55:52| that's intended to mitigate the loss of a historic structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3352)|
| 0:55:55| So those are for historic buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3355)|
| 0:55:57| that are locally significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| but may not have formal designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3359)|
| 0:56:01| And that just allows additional time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3361)|
| 0:56:03| for conversations with the property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3363)|
| 0:56:05| or advocacy organizations like us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3365)|
| 0:56:07| You know, which get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3367)|
| 0:56:09| Mitigation and documentation of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3369)|
| 0:56:11| before it's removed is what typically happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3371)|
| 0:56:14| So there are multiple layers of review of demolition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3374)|
| 0:56:17| That's not to say that someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3377)|
| 0:56:19| could not do what you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3379)|
| 0:56:21| So someone could buy some of the adjacent lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3381)|
| 0:56:23| and houses on them and demolish them if there weren't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3383)|
| 0:56:27| if they weren't in a historic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3387)|
| 0:56:29| or a neighborhood conservation overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3389)|
| 0:56:31| Will it be financially feasible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3391)|
| 0:56:34| and effective for them to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3394)|
| 0:56:37| Maybe not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3397)|
| 0:56:38| I don't necessarily have that data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3398)|
| 0:56:40| I'm not a contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3400)|
| 0:56:41| I don't know that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3401)|
| 0:56:43| But they could technically do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3403)|
| 0:56:45| But they could do that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3405)|
| 0:56:46| In the absence of the middle housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3406)|
| 0:56:48| This does not impact that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3408)|
| 0:56:51| This does not impact whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3411)|
| 0:56:56| a property owner makes a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3416)|
| 0:56:59| to demolition something on their property or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3419)|
| 0:57:03| It just doesn't have any impact on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3423)|
| 0:57:05| Does it have an impact on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3425)|
| 0:57:07| This is a question for you about what you heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3427)|
| 0:57:10| from all of these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3430)|
| 0:57:13| Because it seems like the impact that it could have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3433)|
| 0:57:16| is that there's now more of an incentive to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3436)|
| 0:57:20| That because you could build something larger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3440)|
| 0:57:23| or something that housed more persons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| that there could be a desire there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3445)|
| 0:57:27| Was that something that you saw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3447)|
| 0:57:29| neighbors expressing concern about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3449)|
| 0:57:31| And if so, how did that die off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3451)|
| 0:57:34| It did come up more than once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3454)|
| 0:57:37| Most certainly, it came up at our community outreach events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3457)|
| 0:57:42| as well as a topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3462)|
| 0:57:46| It's one of those things that is a little hard for us to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3466)|
| 0:57:50| as we said earlier, I don't have a crystal ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3470)|
| 0:57:54| I cannot always predict the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3474)|
| 0:57:56| We do not feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3476)|
| 0:57:59| One of the reasons to have the conversion standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3479)|
| 0:58:01| is to prevent demolition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3481)|
| 0:58:03| That is the primary focus and the reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| to have it as a considered best practice across the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3485)|
| 0:58:08| to have conversion standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3488)|
| 0:58:11| So we did some research on our side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3491)|
| 0:58:14| because there's been such a heavy lift| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3494)|
| 0:58:16| on the part of the planning team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3496)|
| 0:58:18| to not just do some online research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3498)|
| 0:58:21| but literally make some phone calls to some cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3501)|
| 0:58:23| that have implemented different zoning changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3503)|
| 0:58:27| related to middle housing because you can only find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3507)|
| 0:58:29| so much online about what's actually happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3509)|
| 0:58:33| And so getting on the phone with several cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3513)|
| 0:58:36| across the southeast has been really great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3516)|
| 0:58:39| for helping us to identify what's actually happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3519)|
| 0:58:43| now that this is in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3523)|
| 0:58:46| And they're just not seeing demolitions happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3526)|
| 0:58:49| What they're seeing is more infill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3529)|
| 0:58:54| not an official infill overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| but infill lots being utilized for middle housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3536)|
| 0:59:02| That's what is happening more traditionally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3542)|
| 0:59:05| across the southeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3545)|
| 0:59:07| And the bad news is no one's tracking it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3547)|
| 0:59:12| No one is tracking exactly what's happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3552)|
| 0:59:14| in their municipality or in any capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3554)|
| 0:59:17| which is something we fully intend to change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3557)|
| 0:59:20| when we should have the opportunity to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3560)|
| 0:59:23| We can't definitely do significant data tracking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3563)|
| 0:59:26| But so what we're getting is from those city officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3566)|
| 0:59:31| their anecdotal response to what they're seeing happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3571)|
| 0:59:36| and what they're approving through plans review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3576)|
| 0:59:39| what they're seeing happen through their zoning process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3579)|
| 0:59:43| et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3583)|
| 0:59:44| So while we don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3584)|
| 0:59:48| and I mean, just in fairness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3588)|
| 0:59:50| demolitions are happening now in the city of Boxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3590)|
| 0:59:54| to build new housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3594)|
| 0:59:56| It is happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3596)|
| 0:59:57| It does happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3597)|
| 0:59:58| This is not specifically going to prevent that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3598)|
| 1:00:02| I think whether the money works out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3602)|
| 1:00:04| because somebody who's going to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| it's going to be about whether they can cancel this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3606)|
| 1:00:10| whether their parking lot is going to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3610)|
| 1:00:13| to make this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3613)|
| 1:00:14| But that's what it's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3614)|
| 1:00:17| I'm going to pose a hypothetical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3617)|
| 1:00:18| that I think Amy's kind of going with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3618)|
| 1:00:21| It would be like, so Oakland-Lincoln Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3621)|
| 1:00:24| 250 foot wide lots that are currently single family homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3624)|
| 1:00:28| zoned R and 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3628)|
| 1:00:30| So under this proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3630)|
| 1:00:32| the biggest building that could be done is a quad, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3632)|
| 1:00:36| In R and 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3636)|
| 1:00:37| So what is the planning staff review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3637)|
| 1:00:41| if someone comes in and buys 250 foot wide lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3641)|
| 1:00:44| demolishes them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3644)|
| 1:00:45| they're still limited to a maximum of 45 foot wide building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3645)|
| 1:00:51| on a 400 foot wide lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3651)|
| 1:00:54| But would that be reviewed as if all the other homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3654)|
| 1:00:58| around are still single family residences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3658)|
| 1:01:01| or a duplex?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3661)|
| 1:01:02| Does the staff review allow denial of a quad in that city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3662)|
| 1:01:08| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3668)|
| 1:01:12| Yes, I think it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3672)|
| 1:01:14| Potentially, I mean, the staff can't deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3674)|
| 1:01:17| It's out of context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3677)|
| 1:01:18| It's not in keeping with the adopted code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3678)|
| 1:01:22| It's out of context with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3682)|
| 1:01:24| It's not house scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3684)|
| 1:01:26| Yes, but I also can't imagine a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3686)|
| 1:01:28| where someone would buy 250 foot wide lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3688)|
| 1:01:31| go to the effort of demolishing the single family houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3691)|
| 1:01:35| on those that are selling for a pretty decent deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3695)|
| 1:01:38| at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3698)|
| 1:01:39| and then not building two quad places on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3699)|
| 1:01:42| Combining the one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3702)|
| 1:01:43| one right in the middle seems like that would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3703)|
| 1:01:46| that would give you less of a financial benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3706)|
| 1:01:49| than building two of the middle housing forms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3709)|
| 1:01:51| that you could build on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3711)|
| 1:01:53| Because a lot of things can be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3713)|
| 1:01:55| I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3715)|
| 1:01:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3716)|
| 1:01:57| Whichever one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3717)|
| 1:01:58| Requirements, 55 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3718)|
| 1:02:01| 55 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3721)|
| 1:02:02| That brings us to the testing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3722)|
| 1:02:04| and some of the modifications that we've been in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3724)|
| 1:02:07| Let me turn this to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3727)|
| 1:02:09| Could you give us the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3729)|
| 1:02:11| and the answer next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3731)|
| 1:02:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3732)|
| 1:02:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3733)|
| 1:02:14| I'm actually going to go over to Lindsay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3734)|
| 1:02:16| who's going to go over the testing that's not done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3736)|
| 1:02:20| Actually, that brings us to another good segue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3740)|
| 1:02:26| One of the other things that we heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3746)|
| 1:02:28| at the Planning Commission meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3748)|
| 1:02:29| was that commissioners and people were concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3749)|
| 1:02:32| that this stuff had not been tested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3752)|
| 1:02:34| And we went through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3754)|
| 1:02:36| so in this postponement period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3756)|
| 1:02:38| we had the opportunity to go through a testing period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3758)|
| 1:02:41| for all of the dimensional standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3761)|
| 1:02:43| So Samuel in our office really took the lead on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3763)|
| 1:02:46| and being relatively new to our office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3766)|
| 1:02:49| we were really excited to have him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3769)|
| 1:02:50| because he has really extensive architectural design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3770)|
| 1:02:53| and SketchUp and GIS skills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3773)|
| 1:02:55| so we got to make use of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3775)|
| 1:02:56| And so if I'm talking at any point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3776)|
| 1:02:58| and you want to clarify or jump in or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3778)|
| 1:03:00| let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3780)|
| 1:03:02| So basically the process involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3782)|
| 1:03:04| a 3D visualization on SketchUp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3784)|
| 1:03:06| And what Samuel went through and did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3786)|
| 1:03:09| was test the minimum lot width| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3789)|
| 1:03:11| for each of these dimensional standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3791)|
| 1:03:13| and then test that as it compared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3793)|
| 1:03:15| to the maximum building depth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3795)|
| 1:03:18| We can pull up that actual chart itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3798)|
| 1:03:20| and discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3800)|
| 1:03:22| So what he wanted to make sure was that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3802)|
| 1:03:24| the buildings would basically work on the lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| We had to set some basic parameters for the testing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3806)|
| 1:03:29| so we did an average lot depth of 120 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3809)|
| 1:03:34| Now often we think about that 50 by 150 feet wide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3814)|
| 1:03:37| or deep, 50 feet wide by 150 feet deep lot as a standard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3817)|
| 1:03:42| but what Samuel found when looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3822)|
| 1:03:44| the few existing middle housing situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3824)|
| 1:03:49| that we have in the TDR land use area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3829)|
| 1:03:51| was that they actually were on lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3831)|
| 1:03:52| even more shallow than that 150.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3832)|
| 1:03:55| So we wanted to see if they could even work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3835)|
| 1:03:56| on something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3836)|
| 1:03:58| We set typical front setbacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3838)|
| 1:04:00| and averaged story heights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3840)|
| 1:04:02| and then tested scenarios with and without the alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3842)|
| 1:04:05| And we'll run through these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3845)|
| 1:04:07| and we can show you guys this kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3847)|
| 1:04:09| But basically the findings were that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3849)|
| 1:04:11| these dimensional standards worked within the test lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3851)|
| 1:04:15| The main issue that we found| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3855)|
| 1:04:18| is that the maximum building width| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3858)|
| 1:04:22| is not always possible with the minimum lot width,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3862)|
| 1:04:26| which when you think about that a little bit more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3866)|
| 1:04:29| that's actually okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3869)|
| 1:04:30| If someone is buying a lot that is say 45 feet wide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3870)|
| 1:04:36| or 45 feet wide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3876)|
| 1:04:39| and they may not have to accommodate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3879)|
| 1:04:42| the maximum building width,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3882)|
| 1:04:43| they can go smaller than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3883)|
| 1:04:44| So that encourages people to continue to build buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3884)|
| 1:04:48| that are compatible with the streetscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3888)|
| 1:04:50| The other one that we'll find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3890)|
| 1:04:51| that you'll see in some of these examples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3891)|
| 1:04:54| that I'm gonna show you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3894)|
| 1:04:55| is that parking is a significant factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3895)|
| 1:04:57| Even with the reductions of one to one dwelling unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3897)|
| 1:05:00| or one space per dwelling unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3900)|
| 1:05:02| obviously parking makes some of these challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3902)|
| 1:05:05| So people may not always be developing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3905)|
| 1:05:08| the maximum building width| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3908)|
| 1:05:09| and the maximum building depth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3909)|
| 1:05:13| So we have some examples of the testing results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3913)|
| 1:05:17| We went through and did both options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3917)|
| 1:05:20| with or without an alley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3920)|
| 1:05:21| and showed the parking configurations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3921)|
| 1:05:25| and how the access would work there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3925)|
| 1:05:28| Just some examples to show you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3928)|
| 1:05:30| Our stacked duplex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3930)|
| 1:05:33| and then we have a fourplex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3933)|
| 1:05:35| where I wanted to call out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3935)|
| 1:05:36| we actually tested a reduced minimum lot width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3936)|
| 1:05:38| So a lot of the feedback we heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3938)|
| 1:05:40| from in particular architects in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3940)|
| 1:05:44| was that the few fourplexes that exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3944)|
| 1:05:48| are actually not a lot smaller than a 55 foot wide lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3948)|
| 1:05:50| and they were like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3950)|
| 1:05:51| why can't you do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3951)|
| 1:05:52| Why can't you make it smaller?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3952)|
| 1:05:53| So we tested from a smaller lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3953)|
| 1:05:56| and we found that that did actually work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3956)|
| 1:05:58| So that will most likely be incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3958)|
| 1:06:00| into the revised dimensional standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3960)|
| 1:06:02| in front of Dwelling December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3962)|
| 1:06:06| Yeah, so that's something that's a benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3966)|
| 1:06:08| We've been able to make some additions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3968)|
| 1:06:10| to the dimensional standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3970)|
| 1:06:11| and some people can speak to this too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3971)|
| 1:06:13| We also had to really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3973)|
| 1:06:15| it made us really think about our parking standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3975)|
| 1:06:18| There were some revisions that had to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3978)|
| 1:06:19| that will be made to the parking standards section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3979)|
| 1:06:22| In particular, there's a section of the code right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3982)|
| 1:06:26| that for properties with an alley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3986)|
| 1:06:28| a duplex can work back out into an alley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3988)|
| 1:06:31| but that triplex and fourplex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3991)|
| 1:06:32| which used to fit into that multifamily kind of bucket,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3992)|
| 1:06:36| could not, but a townhouse could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=3996)|
| 1:06:40| So what we will be proposing is that a triplex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4000)|
| 1:06:43| and a fourplex can back out into an alley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4003)|
| 1:06:45| so that allows people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4005)|
| 1:06:46| and incentivizes people using this alley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4006)|
| 1:06:49| as opposed to having to orient it off the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4009)|
| 1:06:52| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4012)|
| 1:06:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4014)|
| 1:06:55| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4015)|
| 1:06:56| Was accessible parking considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4016)|
| 1:06:59| in this study with triplexes and fourplexes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4019)|
| 1:07:03| Well, I can partly repeat that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4023)|
| 1:07:07| But I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4027)|
| 1:07:09| it can be pretty difficult because multifamily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4029)|
| 1:07:12| needs to be looked at more closely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4032)|
| 1:07:14| than what we actually do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4034)|
| 1:07:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4036)|
| 1:07:17| I have a few questions that I can weigh on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4037)|
| 1:07:21| but that is something that I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4041)|
| 1:07:23| needs to be a consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4043)|
| 1:07:27| But we can talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4047)|
| 1:07:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4048)|
| 1:07:29| To just calculate the impervious surface area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4049)|
| 1:07:34| with parking in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4054)|
| 1:07:48| Because the original zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4068)|
| 1:07:50| impervious area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4070)|
| 1:07:52| is still in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4072)|
| 1:07:55| or does this have a different amount?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4075)|
| 1:07:57| This may have a different amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4077)|
| 1:08:01| Impervious area covers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4081)|
| 1:08:03| The dimensional standards in Table 4.1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4083)|
| 1:08:05| those are superseded by the dimensional standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4085)|
| 1:08:08| in the middle housing code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4088)|
| 1:08:09| if you were working within this framework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4089)|
| 1:08:11| So that includes building and impervious coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4091)|
| 1:08:14| But the new standards don't have coverage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4094)|
| 1:08:18| so by not having it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4098)|
| 1:08:19| it doesn't mean it falls to the original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4099)|
| 1:08:21| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4101)|
| 1:08:22| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4102)|
| 1:08:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4103)|
| 1:08:24| Is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4104)|
| 1:08:25| It is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4105)|
| 1:08:29| We can keep talking about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4109)|
| 1:08:30| and we'll share these with you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4110)|
| 1:08:32| afterwards too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4112)|
| 1:08:33| so you have the capacity to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4113)|
| 1:08:35| do the impervious map or whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4115)|
| 1:08:40| So we tested all of the forms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4120)|
| 1:08:41| I'm just kind of going through like a two, four, six, eight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4121)|
| 1:08:44| just for convenience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4124)|
| 1:08:45| I don't think we necessarily need to do those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4125)|
| 1:08:47| but we tested townhouses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4127)|
| 1:08:49| and then we also went up to the multiplex aspect here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4129)|
| 1:08:56| Some of the examples,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4136)|
| 1:08:57| it really did make us recognize revisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4137)|
| 1:09:00| that needed to be made to the parking standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4140)|
| 1:09:02| but also some minor things to the dimensional standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4142)|
| 1:09:05| One of the things with the townhouses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4145)|
| 1:09:06| that Samuel pointed out was, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4146)|
| 1:09:11| attempting to max out some of these units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4151)|
| 1:09:13| In particular with the townhouses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4153)|
| 1:09:15| it would make for relatively narrow units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4155)|
| 1:09:17| Again, that's not necessarily a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4157)|
| 1:09:19| because that means that someone can just do one less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4159)|
| 1:09:22| and have a wider unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4162)|
| 1:09:24| So that's another element that we found there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4164)|
| 1:09:28| Were there other items or issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4168)|
| 1:09:29| that you think we should bring up here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4169)|
| 1:09:32| I think we covered that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4172)|
| 1:09:33| Initially, we tried without breaking our data standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4173)|
| 1:09:37| for practicing purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4177)|
| 1:09:39| and we realized that that makes it challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4179)|
| 1:09:42| Then we decided that having that position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4182)|
| 1:09:45| to have more people involved here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4185)|
| 1:09:48| And engineering, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4188)|
| 1:09:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4191)|
| 1:09:52| Oh, yeah, we didn't just make it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4192)|
| 1:09:55| Did all of these use the dimensional standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4195)|
| 1:09:59| for parking, like the 26-foot drive-by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4199)|
| 1:10:01| all of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4201)|
| 1:10:02| Yeah, in all of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4202)|
| 1:10:03| except for the multiplex that I used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4203)|
| 1:10:05| because it's just hard to fit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4205)|
| 1:10:07| within the minimum location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4207)|
| 1:10:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4210)|
| 1:10:11| But it is a 56-feet drive-by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4211)|
| 1:10:13| So on that one, it did not include?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4213)|
| 1:10:17| So multiplex, as you see on the left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4217)|
| 1:10:19| I think it has 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4219)|
| 1:10:21| It's 24 feet, not 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4221)|
| 1:10:24| So in the minimum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4224)|
| 1:10:26| we cannot pursue this parking layout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4226)|
| 1:10:31| It has to be different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4231)|
| 1:10:33| and I guess that would make it more challenging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4233)|
| 1:10:35| to have a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4235)|
| 1:10:38| And that was one of the reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4238)|
| 1:10:39| why we went back and made a revision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4239)|
| 1:10:41| allowing for parking variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4241)|
| 1:10:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4243)|
| 1:10:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4245)|
| 1:10:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4247)|
| 1:10:48| Did you say that there was no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4248)|
| 1:10:49| impervious restrictions on these lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4249)|
| 1:10:52| so that they don't have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4252)|
| 1:10:54| there's no standards on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4254)|
| 1:10:57| so they could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4257)|
| 1:11:00| connect the whole parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4260)|
| 1:11:02| the whole lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4262)|
| 1:11:04| And if we're going to do parking variances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4264)|
| 1:11:06| would you consider adding some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4266)|
| 1:11:08| impervious guidelines on there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4268)|
| 1:11:12| so they can reduce their parking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4272)|
| 1:11:17| I just hate to think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4277)|
| 1:11:19| they could get away with not having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4279)|
| 1:11:21| any green space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4281)|
| 1:11:24| But if they're getting a variance for parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4284)|
| 1:11:25| it's pretty much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4285)|
| 1:11:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4286)|
| 1:11:27| Yeah, so they could put more land space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4287)|
| 1:11:29| and green space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4289)|
| 1:11:31| than having to feel like they've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4291)|
| 1:11:33| eight spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4293)|
| 1:11:38| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4298)|
| 1:11:39| Which is the real motivation behind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4299)|
| 1:11:42| the idea of a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4302)|
| 1:11:46| And reducing it to one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4306)|
| 1:11:47| two parking spaces per unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4307)|
| 1:11:49| But we've already said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4309)|
| 1:11:50| yeah, one per unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4310)|
| 1:11:51| which is half of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4311)|
| 1:11:54| is currently required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4314)|
| 1:11:56| So, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4316)|
| 1:11:58| And from a triplex up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4318)|
| 1:12:00| we do have the requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4320)|
| 1:12:02| of a minimum five feet setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4322)|
| 1:12:06| off the property lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4326)|
| 1:12:09| And where there are landscape buffers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4329)|
| 1:12:12| applicable in the parking code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4332)|
| 1:12:14| they are reduced to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4334)|
| 1:12:16| they can be reduced to five feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4336)|
| 1:12:18| but there will be some landscaping around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4338)|
| 1:12:20| Another planner in the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4340)|
| 1:12:22| has brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4342)|
| 1:12:23| and we hope to bring something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4343)|
| 1:12:24| in front of you guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4344)|
| 1:12:26| references to the tree canopy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4346)|
| 1:12:28| This is a planner that's going to be involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4348)|
| 1:12:29| in the Urban Forestry Master Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4349)|
| 1:12:31| And so we'd like to bring something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4351)|
| 1:12:33| that is related to preservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4353)|
| 1:12:35| of existing trees on the property as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4355)|
| 1:12:37| So these are elements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4357)|
| 1:12:38| that we are still considering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4358)|
| 1:12:39| and kind of working through at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4359)|
| 1:12:45| So, there's not anything about impervious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4365)|
| 1:12:50| that could be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4370)|
| 1:12:52| because you're still working through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4372)|
| 1:12:54| the consideration of landscaping?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4374)|
| 1:12:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4377)|
| 1:12:58| We do not currently have anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4378)|
| 1:13:01| for impervious requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4381)|
| 1:13:05| It's one of those things that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4385)|
| 1:13:07| well, we philosophically get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4387)|
| 1:13:11| It isn't always practical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4391)|
| 1:13:13| with this particular type of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4393)|
| 1:13:15| And the geographic area that we're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4395)|
| 1:13:19| has adverse loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4399)|
| 1:13:21| And so it's one of those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4401)|
| 1:13:22| that is not necessarily encouraged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4402)|
| 1:13:27| We think we can't justify it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4407)|
| 1:13:30| We also have side, front, and rear setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4410)|
| 1:13:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4412)|
| 1:13:33| And there's still a regulation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4413)|
| 1:13:35| of the building width on the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4415)|
| 1:13:37| You can't just pave over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4417)|
| 1:13:39| and build over the entire lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4419)|
| 1:13:41| That would not be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4421)|
| 1:13:43| The parking also has five foot setbacks as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4423)|
| 1:13:46| so the parking can go to the edges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4426)|
| 1:13:48| But one of the things that I looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4428)|
| 1:13:50| that took a lot of lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4430)|
| 1:13:52| and put together a bunch of data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4432)|
| 1:13:55| and realized that under current impervious requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4435)|
| 1:14:01| about 51% of the Rn2, Rn3, Rn4 lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4441)|
| 1:14:13| in the zip code that I was looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4453)|
| 1:14:16| or sorry, the Rn2 under the current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4456)|
| 1:14:19| impervious area restrictions would only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4459)|
| 1:14:23| if they were doing a triplex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4463)|
| 1:14:25| with the amount of parking that they would have to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4465)|
| 1:14:28| it would only leave 630 square feet on average| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4468)|
| 1:14:33| left per building footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4473)|
| 1:14:35| So it makes sense because the impervious area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4475)|
| 1:14:37| on that's like 30%, I think, in Rn2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4477)|
| 1:14:41| So there's definitely, it makes sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4481)|
| 1:14:45| to remove that with still having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4485)|
| 1:14:48| the setbacks in there as a protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4488)|
| 1:14:52| I'm not trying to shortchange this conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4492)|
| 1:14:54| because we need to do this very badly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4494)|
| 1:14:56| but just a question about when the adjustments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4496)|
| 1:14:59| and changes that are being made and have been made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4499)|
| 1:15:03| when those will be available for our body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4503)|
| 1:15:05| and the public to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4505)|
| 1:15:09| We hope to have them filled, fair to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4509)|
| 1:15:11| I mean, I don't think that we're making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4511)|
| 1:15:12| any major changes to what's been proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4512)|
| 1:15:16| Primarily just parking related aspects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4516)|
| 1:15:19| Again, we have recognized that some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4519)|
| 1:15:22| of these forms can fit within the minimum lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4522)|
| 1:15:25| that's in particular the fourplex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4525)|
| 1:15:27| and possibly the multiplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4527)|
| 1:15:29| We want to make sure that we take into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4529)|
| 1:15:31| comments that we made today, but also feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4531)|
| 1:15:34| that we share on what you've been hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4534)|
| 1:15:36| about the individuals and the groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4536)|
| 1:15:41| When you show the updated version,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4541)|
| 1:15:44| is it possible to clearly indicate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4544)|
| 1:15:47| where changes have been made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4547)|
| 1:15:49| Like a red line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4549)|
| 1:15:50| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4550)|
| 1:15:52| What was the reason for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4552)|
| 1:15:56| with this one specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4556)|
| 1:15:58| the with an alley and without an alley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4558)|
| 1:16:01| both being the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4561)|
| 1:16:02| Before that, if that works better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4562)|
| 1:16:06| in this case, would it also work better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4566)|
| 1:16:08| in the other zones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4568)|
| 1:16:10| I think we just chose to test it on the two foot lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4570)|
| 1:16:16| because we heard that pushback about the lot width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4576)|
| 1:16:21| On the specific housing form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4581)|
| 1:16:24| So the answer to your second question is maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4584)|
| 1:16:29| But we do want to recognize that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4589)|
| 1:16:34| if you're having this input directly on that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4594)|
| 1:16:38| If there is an alley, then they have to use that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4598)|
| 1:16:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4600)|
| 1:16:43| So the one without the alley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4603)|
| 1:16:45| the setback, is that going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4605)|
| 1:16:47| on the other side of that drive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4607)|
| 1:16:48| Or is that drive considered a setback?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4608)|
| 1:16:52| Is there going to be green space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4612)|
| 1:16:53| on the other side of that driveway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4613)|
| 1:16:55| Or can the driveway be within the site setback?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4615)|
| 1:16:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4618)|
| 1:17:04| Did we interrupt that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4624)|
| 1:17:06| Because the question was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4626)|
| 1:17:08| is there landscaping required?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4628)|
| 1:17:10| On the other side of the driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4630)|
| 1:17:11| Is the driveway going to be 5%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4631)|
| 1:17:13| Yeah, that's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4633)|
| 1:17:15| Because the parking needs to be 5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4635)|
| 1:17:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4637)|
| 1:17:19| So the driveway does not need to be 5%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4639)|
| 1:17:21| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4641)|
| 1:17:24| So in this instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4644)|
| 1:17:26| that driveway actually needs to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4646)|
| 1:17:28| when it got to the parking area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4648)|
| 1:17:30| then have a setback and curve into the parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4650)|
| 1:17:34| Since the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4654)|
| 1:17:36| It looks like the middle one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4656)|
| 1:17:37| where the driveway runs all the way along the side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4657)|
| 1:17:39| The parking area, I would assume,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4659)|
| 1:17:42| is considered where the stalls are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4662)|
| 1:17:45| as well as the driveway behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4665)|
| 1:17:48| So with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4668)|
| 1:17:50| would you actually be able to put a driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4670)|
| 1:17:52| along the side of the property line all the way back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4672)|
| 1:17:54| or would it need a setback to reach the parking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4674)|
| 1:17:57| Historically, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4677)|
| 1:17:59| So it's an amazing parking stall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4679)|
| 1:18:06| Can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4686)|
| 1:18:07| Excuse me, Brian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4687)|
| 1:18:08| That is currently out of focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4688)|
| 1:18:12| I got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4692)|
| 1:18:13| I got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4693)|
| 1:18:14| Jumping back to the impervious area discussion real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4694)|
| 1:18:18| Have there been any discussions with city engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4698)|
| 1:18:21| about the impervious side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4701)|
| 1:18:23| I mean, only mainly from a stormwater run perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4703)|
| 1:18:27| I mean, if we're going so impervious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4707)|
| 1:18:30| then it's going to create more flow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4710)|
| 1:18:33| faster flow into the existing system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4713)|
| 1:18:37| I know somewhere, as I've read it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| I don't remember what it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4719)|
| 1:18:40| but do we know how many lots are available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4720)|
| 1:18:43| There was a number in RE2, RE3, and RE4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4723)|
| 1:18:46| There's actually X amount of vacant lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4726)|
| 1:18:48| that could be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4728)|
| 1:18:50| So it may be an exciting question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4730)|
| 1:18:52| It might be so small anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4732)|
| 1:18:54| But theoretically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4734)|
| 1:18:55| if they're coming to convert everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4735)|
| 1:18:57| and build out the remaining lots with the basic middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4737)|
| 1:19:01| how does that affect stormwater run?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4741)|
| 1:19:04| That's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4744)|
| 1:19:08| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4748)|
| 1:19:10| Did you all have that conversation with city engineering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4750)|
| 1:19:12| I believe that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4752)|
| 1:19:13| Did you all have that conversation with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4753)|
| 1:19:15| We've had conversations with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4755)|
| 1:19:17| but it's still an uncertain scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4757)|
| 1:19:23| We sort of feel like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4763)|
| 1:19:25| based on what we can see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4765)|
| 1:19:27| and what we see as those vacant lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4767)|
| 1:19:29| that you're referencing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4769)|
| 1:19:31| it's still, I don't want to sound like a broken record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4771)|
| 1:19:34| but it still appears to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4774)|
| 1:19:36| that this is really going to be very incremental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4776)|
| 1:19:39| and that this is not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4779)|
| 1:19:41| and that's not what is happening across the country either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4781)|
| 1:19:44| but it's absorbable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4784)|
| 1:19:47| with our current infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4787)|
| 1:19:50| And we also have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4790)|
| 1:19:52| going out to the cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4792)|
| 1:19:54| you have lots of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4794)|
| 1:19:56| the topics are not limited to just the thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4796)|
| 1:19:58| that you are there to present about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4798)|
| 1:20:00| so we get lots of other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4800)|
| 1:20:02| You may extend that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4802)|
| 1:20:03| Capacity is one of the things that has also come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4803)|
| 1:20:06| We sat down with KPB three times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4806)|
| 1:20:09| to go over the geographic area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4809)|
| 1:20:12| to talk about their capacity as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4812)|
| 1:20:15| and they have a lot of confidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4815)|
| 1:20:18| about their capacity to be able to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4818)|
| 1:20:22| Yeah, and again, I'm not saying I have a problem with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4822)|
| 1:20:25| but I'm just kind of approaching the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4825)|
| 1:20:27| As it is incrementally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4827)|
| 1:20:29| it will incrementally increase the stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4829)|
| 1:20:32| Right, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4832)|
| 1:20:33| Excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4833)|
| 1:20:34| That's more of a compliment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4834)|
| 1:20:39| Well, and so we will share the package with you guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4839)|
| 1:20:44| and then if you have additional questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4844)|
| 1:20:46| you can reach out to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4846)|
| 1:20:49| I have some questions about the parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4849)|
| 1:20:51| but I can wait if there's another step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4851)|
| 1:20:55| or something else to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4855)|
| 1:20:57| We have one more topic to cover,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4857)|
| 1:21:00| and then we can definitely do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4860)|
| 1:21:02| some broader parking conversations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4862)|
| 1:21:04| but also it would be beneficial for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4864)|
| 1:21:06| We want to hear that from you, for sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4866)|
| 1:21:09| and if that has to be individually or in a group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4869)|
| 1:21:11| that's good too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4871)|
| 1:21:12| because those are good specific ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4872)|
| 1:21:14| Do you, I mean, is that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4874)|
| 1:21:16| Yeah, we wanted to cover a hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4876)|
| 1:21:19| that came up as a topic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4879)|
| 1:21:22| which you all wanted us to take a look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4882)|
| 1:21:24| What has been going on with our communities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4884)|
| 1:21:27| What have you all seen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4887)|
| 1:21:28| Cheryl's already touched on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4888)|
| 1:21:29| but Arsenal has a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4889)|
| 1:21:33| Yeah, so that was one of the topics we heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4893)|
| 1:21:36| and we've done a pretty extensive review via research,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4896)|
| 1:21:40| but also then, as Cheryl was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4900)|
| 1:21:42| we direct conversations with other municipalities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4902)|
| 1:21:45| and I have a spreadsheet of research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4905)|
| 1:21:47| that has a lot of links,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4907)|
| 1:21:49| so you can really go as deep into this as you want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4909)|
| 1:21:51| and we'll share this with you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4911)|
| 1:21:53| We wanted to just touch on a couple of the aspects of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4913)|
| 1:21:56| and some of the data that's available associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4916)|
| 1:21:59| So there are two real landmark decisions in middle housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4919)|
| 1:22:03| and these are the ones you may have heard about on the news,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4923)|
| 1:22:05| and they occurred in Minneapolis and in Portland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4925)|
| 1:22:08| in 2020 and then in 2021, respectively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4928)|
| 1:22:13| and we're just touching on these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4933)|
| 1:22:15| as these are sort of the initial ones that happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4935)|
| 1:22:17| and these are ones that were really big programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4937)|
| 1:22:19| that happened citywide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4939)|
| 1:22:20| and that's not what we're proposing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4940)|
| 1:22:24| Minneapolis accomplished theirs via a comprehensive plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4944)|
| 1:22:27| and then a code that responded to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4947)|
| 1:22:29| They allowed up to triplexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4949)|
| 1:22:31| in all residential zoning districts citywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4951)|
| 1:22:35| This also included amendments to the parking code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4955)|
| 1:22:38| regulations for lot combinations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4958)|
| 1:22:40| and subdivisions in lower-density districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4960)|
| 1:22:42| and then a built form overlay district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4962)|
| 1:22:44| which has development review design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4964)|
| 1:22:48| that are very location-specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4968)|
| 1:22:50| In Portland, they instituted a new code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4970)|
| 1:22:53| which increased just blanket over the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4973)|
| 1:22:55| an increase of allowable units per lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4975)|
| 1:22:57| based on the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4977)|
| 1:22:59| They also had design and dimensional standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4979)|
| 1:23:02| The point of these two is that you hear about them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4982)|
| 1:23:05| a lot in the news,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4985)|
| 1:23:06| and you hear a lot of their information cited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4986)|
| 1:23:08| because these were the major citywide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4988)|
| 1:23:10| sort of groundbreaking ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4990)|
| 1:23:11| but they are really multifaceted projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4991)|
| 1:23:15| so there is a new comprehensive plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4995)|
| 1:23:17| but there's also code amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4997)|
| 1:23:19| and they're really sort of a big,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=4999)|
| 1:23:22| overarching thing that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5002)|
| 1:23:24| Because these were two of the earliest adopters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5004)|
| 1:23:27| of citywide policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5007)|
| 1:23:28| they have data that's really easily accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5008)|
| 1:23:32| The first one, Minneapolis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5012)|
| 1:23:34| they have reported this construction data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5014)|
| 1:23:36| from 2020 to 2022,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5016)|
| 1:23:38| and you can see there how many duplexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5018)|
| 1:23:41| and triplexes were permitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5021)|
| 1:23:43| and it's really surprising,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5023)|
| 1:23:45| but also not surprising how small of a number that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5025)|
| 1:23:48| It's 64 duplexes and 21 triplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5028)|
| 1:23:51| Obviously, the most common type was a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5031)|
| 1:23:54| Portland does an annual report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5034)|
| 1:23:56| so their most recent one had construction data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5036)|
| 1:23:59| from the fiscal year 2022,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5039)|
| 1:24:01| August 21 to July 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5041)|
| 1:24:04| That was 34 duplexes permitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5044)|
| 1:24:07| and then surprisingly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5047)|
| 1:24:08| the most common type was four plexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5048)|
| 1:24:10| There were 204,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5050)|
| 1:24:12| and then just to compare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5052)|
| 1:24:13| there were 78 single-family houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5053)|
| 1:24:15| that were permitted in that year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5055)|
| 1:24:18| There are other municipalities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5058)|
| 1:24:20| and I can connect you guys with these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5060)|
| 1:24:22| Other municipalities have reporting practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5062)|
| 1:24:24| that we really will want to draw from as a model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5064)|
| 1:24:27| Raleigh and Durham, North Carolina,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5067)|
| 1:24:29| have monthly reports online,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5069)|
| 1:24:31| and then I believe it's Durham| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5071)|
| 1:24:33| that makes an annual report to their legislative body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5073)|
| 1:24:36| so there's a lot of framework that we can draw from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5076)|
| 1:24:39| for how we present this information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5079)|
| 1:24:41| to you guys and to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5081)|
| 1:24:44| The kind of takeaways from some of the data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5084)|
| 1:24:46| if you'll review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5086)|
| 1:24:47| is, again, it's incremental change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5087)|
| 1:24:50| Even adopting these policies citywide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5090)|
| 1:24:53| does not necessarily make them more cost-effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5093)|
| 1:24:56| Affordable doesn't deal with all of the other factors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5096)|
| 1:24:58| that come into these issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5098)|
| 1:24:59| that have kind of led to this housing situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5099)|
| 1:25:02| so it is incremental change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5102)|
| 1:25:04| Also, extenuating circumstances can delay a rollout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5104)|
| 1:25:07| so that Minneapolis's data that started in January of 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5107)|
| 1:25:11| obviously, it was affected by the pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5111)|
| 1:25:13| by construction material costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5113)|
| 1:25:15| by all sorts of extenuating circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5115)|
| 1:25:18| And then, finally, a lot of the things that we found| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5118)|
| 1:25:20| were just that a clear and efficient review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5120)|
| 1:25:22| and approval process is critical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5122)|
| 1:25:24| so that goes back to the process slides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5124)|
| 1:25:26| that Amy was breaking down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5126)|
| 1:25:27| how having staff that are invested and empowered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5127)|
| 1:25:32| and having documentation available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5132)|
| 1:25:35| Some of you will enjoy some research found| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5135)|
| 1:25:37| that in Spokane, Washington,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5137)|
| 1:25:39| they have a specific new housing support team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5139)|
| 1:25:41| that you can schedule little calls with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5141)|
| 1:25:43| to talk to planners or plans reviewers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5143)|
| 1:25:45| about how to work with your property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5145)|
| 1:25:47| so we have a lot of inspiration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5147)|
| 1:25:49| for how we even support folks working on these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5149)|
| 1:25:53| We did a peer review of sort of comparable cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5153)|
| 1:25:56| in the southeast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5156)|
| 1:25:57| the ones that have adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5157)|
| 1:25:59| or are working through these Texas zoning code changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5159)|
| 1:26:01| and I can share it with you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5161)|
| 1:26:03| They all have really good websites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5163)|
| 1:26:05| but both Raleigh and Durham in 2019| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5165)|
| 1:26:08| and then 21 and 22 allow duplexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5168)|
| 1:26:10| in all single-family zoning districts at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5170)|
| 1:26:13| Durham has more tiered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5173)|
| 1:26:15| both of them have tiered allowances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5175)|
| 1:26:16| based on the zoning districts or proximity to transit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5176)|
| 1:26:19| and they have really good documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5179)|
| 1:26:21| on monitoring and reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5181)|
| 1:26:24| Arlington, Virginia is kind of in progress right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5184)|
| 1:26:27| but the proposal and what was adopted by their council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5187)|
| 1:26:29| was to allow it to six units in zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5189)|
| 1:26:32| Obviously, Arlington has a different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5192)|
| 1:26:34| being close to D.C.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5194)|
| 1:26:35| has a really different situation than Nassau| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5195)|
| 1:26:38| or even Raleigh or Durham,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5198)|
| 1:26:40| but they have these design and dimensional standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5200)|
| 1:26:43| to ensure compatible scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5203)|
| 1:26:44| and then we talk about Memphis a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5204)|
| 1:26:46| and the building code amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5206)|
| 1:26:47| that have been sort of underway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5207)|
| 1:26:48| to permit these structures under the residential code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5208)|
| 1:26:52| Memphis does a really good job of prioritizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5212)|
| 1:26:54| what they've been doing lately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5214)|
| 1:26:55| or they've wrapped up as a major comprehensive plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5215)|
| 1:26:58| and they really prioritize middle housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5218)|
| 1:27:01| in that comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5221)|
| 1:27:04| Also, there are a lot of municipalities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5224)|
| 1:27:06| that we see cited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5226)|
| 1:27:07| especially when we were working with Opticos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5227)|
| 1:27:09| We hear some about Greenville, Chattanooga, Ashland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5229)|
| 1:27:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5232)|
| 1:27:13| In the Raleigh example where you say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5233)|
| 1:27:15| that there are additional allowances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5235)|
| 1:27:17| what does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5237)|
| 1:27:18| Well, so there are other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5238)|
| 1:27:20| you can do more intense forms of housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5240)|
| 1:27:23| with additional units in areas that are close to transit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5243)|
| 1:27:26| and I think they did this one alongside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5246)|
| 1:27:28| a rollout of a bigger transit program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5248)|
| 1:27:31| so they sort of coincided it with this map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5251)|
| 1:27:33| and they said, okay, when you're by this stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5253)|
| 1:27:35| and this stop and this stop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5255)|
| 1:27:36| you may be able to talk to a quadplex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5256)|
| 1:27:38| or a sixplex, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5258)|
| 1:27:39| Okay, which does seem very liberal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5259)|
| 1:27:41| Yeah, yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5261)|
| 1:27:44| A lot of cities have completed studies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5264)|
| 1:27:46| is what we found.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5266)|
| 1:27:47| We kind of tried to look at our real immediate neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5267)|
| 1:27:49| Chattanooga, Asheville, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5269)|
| 1:27:51| and a lot of them are more in the study process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5271)|
| 1:27:54| and so, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5274)|
| 1:27:56| Knoxville is sort of moving closer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5276)|
| 1:27:58| to the Durham and Raleigh side of having policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5278)|
| 1:28:01| but we are starting, in a smaller scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5281)|
| 1:28:03| having a specific target area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5283)|
| 1:28:05| as opposed to adopting this citywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5285)|
| 1:28:07| There is a lot, in terms of the research at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5287)|
| 1:28:10| we'll share it with you guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5290)|
| 1:28:11| but it is a bottomless well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5291)|
| 1:28:12| We could not have reviewed every municipality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5292)|
| 1:28:15| that has adopted this kind of code changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5295)|
| 1:28:18| and so there's a lot to take away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5298)|
| 1:28:20| in terms of best practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5300)|
| 1:28:21| but we hope that we can kind of keep engaging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5301)|
| 1:28:24| with comparable cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5304)|
| 1:28:26| especially as we look for recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5306)|
| 1:28:29| on implementation and review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5309)|
| 1:28:31| and we can always find a way to share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5311)|
| 1:28:33| those additional results with you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5313)|
| 1:28:38| Close out here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5318)|
| 1:28:39| and if you have any more discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5319)|
| 1:28:41| Any questions about that period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5321)|
| 1:28:46| I do want to bring up something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5326)|
| 1:28:47| before we close it down and open up to more Q&A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5327)|
| 1:28:50| is last night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5330)|
| 1:28:53| City Council did pass a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5333)|
| 1:28:55| requesting Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5335)|
| 1:28:57| to consider an R and 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5337)|
| 1:29:01| as part of this proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5341)|
| 1:29:03| so I will share with you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5343)|
| 1:29:05| that I don't know that we will be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5345)|
| 1:29:07| to provide an in-depth analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5347)|
| 1:29:09| of what that looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5349)|
| 1:29:10| We can say how many properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5350)|
| 1:29:11| are zoned R and 1 in the TDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5351)|
| 1:29:14| claims classification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5354)|
| 1:29:16| how many are vacant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5356)|
| 1:29:17| how many overall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5357)|
| 1:29:19| but that is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5359)|
| 1:29:20| that you have been asked to deliberate on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5360)|
| 1:29:23| Just in the TDR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5363)|
| 1:29:24| Just in the TDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5364)|
| 1:29:27| With R and 1 being probably the biggest barrier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5367)|
| 1:29:31| to housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5371)|
| 1:29:34| did we look at Nashville's urban zone overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5374)|
| 1:29:37| because they removed apartment buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5377)|
| 1:29:41| in those traditional neighborhood areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5381)|
| 1:29:45| I did not specifically research that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5385)|
| 1:29:48| Seemingly, with success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5388)|
| 1:29:52| Yeah, that's a good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5392)|
| 1:29:53| I would like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5393)|
| 1:29:56| What was the name of that zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5396)|
| 1:29:58| Urban?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5398)|
| 1:29:59| It's the urban zoning overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5399)|
| 1:30:01| Oh, the urban zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5401)|
| 1:30:02| Nashville's urban zone overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5402)|
| 1:30:07| And they drew a circle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5407)|
| 1:30:09| around or within the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5409)|
| 1:30:11| similar to ours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5411)|
| 1:30:12| with those traditional neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5412)|
| 1:30:15| and removed apartment buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5415)|
| 1:30:18| Yes, we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5418)|
| 1:30:19| I would definitely like to incorporate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5419)|
| 1:30:21| into our appeal review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5421)|
| 1:30:27| Anything else, Tom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5427)|
| 1:30:28| For the other cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5428)|
| 1:30:30| like Minneapolis and Portland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5430)|
| 1:30:31| when they said the number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5431)|
| 1:30:34| four places that will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5434)|
| 1:30:37| did their numbers say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5437)|
| 1:30:39| as a percentage of parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5439)|
| 1:30:42| or like the scales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5442)|
| 1:30:44| how does it scale compared to ours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5444)|
| 1:30:46| We have extra for ours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5446)|
| 1:30:47| so 12%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5447)|
| 1:30:48| No, those specific reports did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5448)|
| 1:30:51| give a percentage of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5451)|
| 1:30:54| overall built environment in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5454)|
| 1:30:57| They were reviewing permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5457)|
| 1:30:58| that were pulled back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5458)|
| 1:31:00| Would it be possible to get back to that report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5460)|
| 1:31:03| and look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5463)|
| 1:31:05| of these duplex, duplex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5465)|
| 1:31:08| and compare to the analysis claim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5468)|
| 1:31:10| that we can figure out duplex perplex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5470)|
| 1:31:12| versus single main percentage wise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5472)|
| 1:31:15| but cross| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5475)|
| 1:31:19| one scale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5479)|
| 1:31:20| I guess my point is just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5480)|
| 1:31:22| if you drew up 204 fourplexes in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5482)|
| 1:31:25| that would be a much bigger percentage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5485)|
| 1:31:27| than Fort Worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5487)|
| 1:31:30| Just to help put the numbers in perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5490)|
| 1:31:31| Yeah, I think it's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5491)|
| 1:31:33| to keep it in perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5493)|
| 1:31:34| These cities are much larger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5494)|
| 1:31:37| The situations are just different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5497)|
| 1:31:40| Our context is very different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5500)|
| 1:31:41| What we can provide you all with is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5501)|
| 1:31:44| how many duplexes have been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5504)|
| 1:31:46| We have that data at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5506)|
| 1:31:50| I say come to the special use process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5510)|
| 1:31:52| so we can share that kind of data with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5512)|
| 1:31:54| What's been happening in the last few years here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5514)|
| 1:31:56| since we updated the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5516)|
| 1:32:01| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5521)|
| 1:32:02| Just thinking on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5522)|
| 1:32:05| request for planning commissions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5525)|
| 1:32:07| to look at RN1 in TBR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5527)|
| 1:32:12| because I feel like the assessment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5532)|
| 1:32:15| of how much RN1 there was in TBR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5535)|
| 1:32:19| was quite small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5539)|
| 1:32:20| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5540)|
| 1:32:21| There's 51 vacant lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5541)|
| 1:32:24| Do we have the data on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5544)|
| 1:32:26| It's a very small percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5546)|
| 1:32:27| It's under, I would say under 4%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5547)|
| 1:32:29| as a total acreage zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5549)|
| 1:32:32| RN1 in TBR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5552)|
| 1:32:34| Is it vacant property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5554)|
| 1:32:35| No, it's total RN1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5555)|
| 1:32:39| When you compare it to RN2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5559)|
| 1:32:41| there's many more properties than RN2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5561)|
| 1:32:47| I'd say it's 2%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5567)|
| 1:32:50| It's vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5570)|
| 1:32:51| No, vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5571)|
| 1:32:53| Oh, it is vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5573)|
| 1:32:54| Yeah, that is vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5574)|
| 1:32:59| One of the RN1 in those areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5579)|
| 1:33:02| is also LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5582)|
| 1:33:05| Well, in some of the areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5585)|
| 1:33:08| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5588)|
| 1:33:09| That would not be what you've been asked to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5589)|
| 1:33:11| So it's just RN1 in a traditional neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5591)|
| 1:33:17| But that might explain why there's not as much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5597)|
| 1:33:20| as it would seem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5600)|
| 1:33:24| RN1 is 6.7% of the land area in TBR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5604)|
| 1:33:31| Compared to RN2, which is 62.7%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5611)|
| 1:33:35| So I just bring it up because I think the proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5615)|
| 1:33:38| that was written is trying to include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5618)|
| 1:33:42| the largest areas for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5622)|
| 1:33:45| So the addition of RN1 in this case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5625)|
| 1:33:48| is interesting because it's a very small portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5628)|
| 1:33:56| So we'll be asking all for guidance on whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5636)|
| 1:33:58| or not you want that included in your proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5638)|
| 1:34:01| And what I would anticipate is that we would need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5641)|
| 1:34:02| to go back, and if you all wanted to say yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5642)|
| 1:34:05| we want this included, we would come back with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5645)|
| 1:34:09| modifications to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5649)|
| 1:34:14| the development types that would be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5654)|
| 1:34:16| Does that mean that if in December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5656)|
| 1:34:22| Planning Commission said, yes, we do want you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5662)|
| 1:34:25| to include this, we do want you to include RN1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5665)|
| 1:34:29| in this proposal, that we would be delaying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5669)|
| 1:34:33| the actuality of the door?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5673)|
| 1:34:36| That's a very good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5676)|
| 1:34:37| We would recommend that you not delay it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5677)|
| 1:34:39| We recommend, I mean, that you go ahead and send it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5679)|
| 1:34:41| I'm not asking for delay, I'm asking would it delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5681)|
| 1:34:44| That would be up to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5684)|
| 1:34:46| Whether or not you wanted to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5686)|
| 1:34:47| we want to postpone this for you to add RN1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5687)|
| 1:34:50| or we want to go ahead and send this forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5690)|
| 1:34:51| as it's currently proposed and we want you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5691)|
| 1:34:53| to amend it to add RN1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5693)|
| 1:34:57| And that amendment could happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5697)|
| 1:34:59| at the City Council stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5699)|
| 1:35:01| It could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5701)|
| 1:35:05| So that the RN1 would likely only be allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5705)|
| 1:35:09| to have up to five months, or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5709)|
| 1:35:13| Theoretically, or in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5713)|
| 1:35:19| Yeah, you all could weigh in on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5719)|
| 1:35:22| and direct us as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5722)|
| 1:35:25| It seemed like a lot of the concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5725)|
| 1:35:28| from people who are at the meeting in support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5728)|
| 1:35:31| that had concerns, were about the coverage and parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5731)|
| 1:35:35| And RN1 being one of those wanting to include that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5735)|
| 1:35:40| even if it is a small percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5740)|
| 1:35:42| But then also the parking minimums seem to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5742)|
| 1:35:45| a concern with a lot of the supporters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5745)|
| 1:35:48| who wanted to get a closer look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5748)|
| 1:35:52| Another reason I was saying I had more questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5752)|
| 1:35:55| about the parking is really in regards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5755)|
| 1:35:59| to standards for accessible parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5759)|
| 1:36:03| If you do a triplex or a quadplex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5763)|
| 1:36:10| you'd have to have accessible parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5770)|
| 1:36:11| which would, the minimum dimension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5771)|
| 1:36:14| of accessible parking is five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5774)|
| 1:36:16| If you just have one, you have to do a van,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5776)|
| 1:36:18| so the minimum dimension is 16 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5778)|
| 1:36:20| which would take up a large majority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5780)|
| 1:36:23| of most of the parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5783)|
| 1:36:25| So for example, if you have alley parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5785)|
| 1:36:28| because of that width, to fit within the majority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5788)|
| 1:36:35| anything 50 feet or less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5795)|
| 1:36:38| any of the lots that are 50 feet wide or less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5798)|
| 1:36:40| once you take out 10 feet for the side setbacks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5800)|
| 1:36:43| 16 feet for the accessible parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5803)|
| 1:36:48| you're left over with a little less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5808)|
| 1:36:51| than three parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5811)|
| 1:36:53| And so that, I think, is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5813)|
| 1:36:55| that we need to take a closer look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5815)|
| 1:36:58| hopefully before December and see if maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5818)|
| 1:37:00| there's alternatives to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5820)|
| 1:37:02| And then also, I don't know if there could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5822)|
| 1:37:05| dimensional variations to the parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5825)|
| 1:37:09| like the four standards overlay allows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5829)|
| 1:37:11| for smaller job aisles and more narrow parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5831)|
| 1:37:15| Maybe that's a solution to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5835)|
| 1:37:17| but I think that it makes more sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5837)|
| 1:37:20| to make the parking a little bit more flexible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5840)|
| 1:37:23| Because also, the allowance of a variance for parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5843)|
| 1:37:28| I do wonder if, you have to say you have a hardship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5848)|
| 1:37:33| if you're doing a quadplex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5853)|
| 1:37:35| and you can't get the standard parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5855)|
| 1:37:38| could DZA not say, well, you could do a triplex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5858)|
| 1:37:42| this isn't preventing you from leaving the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5862)|
| 1:37:45| So no, you can't have a variance on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5865)|
| 1:37:48| Yes, the DZA could say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5868)|
| 1:37:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5870)|
| 1:37:51| Yeah, because the definition for legal hardships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5871)|
| 1:37:54| is really clear from the statute case law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5874)|
| 1:37:56| and then also our city code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5876)|
| 1:37:58| That has to be something inherent in the property itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5878)|
| 1:38:01| within the dirt, if you think of it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5881)|
| 1:38:04| It can't be, I've over-designed this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5884)|
| 1:38:07| so therefore I need a variance on the parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5887)|
| 1:38:10| or this isn't financially feasible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5890)|
| 1:38:12| so therefore that's my hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5892)|
| 1:38:14| It has to be something inherent about the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5894)|
| 1:38:16| whether that's topography, a simple and weird space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5896)|
| 1:38:19| that drives the design in a different direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5899)|
| 1:38:21| that requires an exception,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5901)|
| 1:38:23| whether it's kind of a wonky shaped lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5903)|
| 1:38:26| something along those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5906)|
| 1:38:27| It has to be inherent in the property itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5907)|
| 1:38:30| So let's take that to the real applicability of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5910)|
| 1:38:34| because it seems like most of these lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5914)|
| 1:38:36| won't have those unique challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5916)|
| 1:38:41| So adding this variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5921)|
| 1:38:43| what would be a reason to approve the variance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5923)|
| 1:38:47| Well, the DZA is always tasked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5927)|
| 1:38:49| with first finding that hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5929)|
| 1:38:51| So if they are coming forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5931)|
| 1:38:53| and they don't have any of those exceptional circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5933)|
| 1:38:56| then no, there wouldn't be any cause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5936)|
| 1:38:58| to legally support the granting of that variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5938)|
| 1:39:01| However, we do have those administrative deviations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5941)|
| 1:39:04| that are included,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5944)|
| 1:39:05| and I don't know if you want to go back to that slide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5945)|
| 1:39:08| but there are those included as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5948)|
| 1:39:11| where that can just go through staff approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5951)|
| 1:39:13| It doesn't have to go to the DZA planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5953)|
| 1:39:15| or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5955)|
| 1:39:17| But the parking would have to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5957)|
| 1:39:20| If it's not included in the list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5960)|
| 1:39:22| of the administrative variations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5962)|
| 1:39:25| then it would have to go for a variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5965)|
| 1:39:27| but again, a variance is only allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5967)|
| 1:39:29| in the parking context for real housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5969)|
| 1:39:32| So are they found by the same standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5972)|
| 1:39:35| as the DZA, the staff, on approving the variance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5975)|
| 1:39:39| On approving the administrative deviations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5979)|
| 1:39:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5981)|
| 1:39:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5982)|
| 1:39:43| So...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5983)|
| 1:39:44| Well, it's on your side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5984)|
| 1:39:45| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5985)|
| 1:39:46| Design standards, I don't want to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5986)|
| 1:39:49| If you all want me to read it out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5989)|
| 1:39:51| or I can highlight it and send it to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5991)|
| 1:39:53| it's in section 4.16,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5993)|
| 1:39:55| but I can share those with you if that's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5995)|
| 1:39:57| But it doesn't cover parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5997)|
| 1:39:59| It doesn't cover parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=5999)|
| 1:40:00| I do agree with you that the accessible parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6000)|
| 1:40:03| is something that we need to have a conversation about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6003)|
| 1:40:05| For sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6005)|
| 1:40:06| Yeah, because...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6006)|
| 1:40:07| I appreciate you bringing that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6007)|
| 1:40:08| One thing, I was very gung-ho last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6008)|
| 1:40:11| and then with the delay, I was like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6011)|
| 1:40:13| well, I'll take this time to take a closer look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6013)|
| 1:40:15| at some of the things I've heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6015)|
| 1:40:17| So what I did was export,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6017)|
| 1:40:22| pull the tax records for all the vacant parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6022)|
| 1:40:25| in a 37917 zip code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6025)|
| 1:40:29| which covers North Knoxville within the perimeter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6029)|
| 1:40:32| So it's not counting Kansansville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6032)|
| 1:40:35| and parts of East Knoxville that would be affected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6035)|
| 1:40:37| but most of these dimensions are similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6037)|
| 1:40:40| So I exported that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6040)|
| 1:40:42| and with the help of an intern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6042)|
| 1:40:45| added in the dimensions of all of those parcels that we pulled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6045)|
| 1:40:49| and also the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6049)|
| 1:40:51| just to kind of get a good picture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6051)|
| 1:40:53| of what would actually be applicable here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6053)|
| 1:40:57| And from that data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6057)|
| 1:40:59| NTDR, RN2, RN3, RN4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6059)|
| 1:41:04| I found that I think about 52% of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6064)|
| 1:41:09| are 50 feet or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6069)|
| 1:41:11| And then also for the quadplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6071)|
| 1:41:14| that might also include some of the port parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6074)|
| 1:41:18| that are 60 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6078)|
| 1:41:20| and what are the whole quadplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6080)|
| 1:41:23| But the point being,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6083)|
| 1:41:25| that would really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6085)|
| 1:41:27| if these parking standards are required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6087)|
| 1:41:30| 50% of these either could not be triplexes or duplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6090)|
| 1:41:35| or they would have to have very large parking lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6095)|
| 1:41:38| And again, with the additional standards of a parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6098)|
| 1:41:42| like this, if you look out here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6102)|
| 1:41:44| to have a double-stacked parking aisle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6104)|
| 1:41:48| drive aisle with parking spaces on each side perpendicular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6108)|
| 1:41:51| that is 60 feet of width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6111)|
| 1:41:55| So you can't do that straight on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6115)|
| 1:41:58| like we talked about with that one example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6118)|
| 1:42:00| where you made the drive aisle too small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6120)|
| 1:42:03| And if you have to come in and maneuver sideways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6123)|
| 1:42:06| it takes up a lot of the lot space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6126)|
| 1:42:08| So I do think that the parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6128)|
| 1:42:10| just by nature of how much space we need for vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6130)|
| 1:42:14| is going to be a lot more restrictive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6134)|
| 1:42:18| than even with the lowered standards for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6138)|
| 1:42:22| So that's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6142)|
| 1:42:23| What's your solution for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6143)|
| 1:42:25| No parking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6145)|
| 1:42:26| No parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6146)|
| 1:42:27| Or at least, would you all consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6147)|
| 1:42:30| I think there's one recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6150)|
| 1:42:32| within the Court of Appellate Treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6152)|
| 1:42:35| We actually intended to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6155)|
| 1:42:38| we didn't really talk about that today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6158)|
| 1:42:41| but that, it's on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6161)|
| 1:42:44| It's what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6164)|
| 1:42:45| It's coming back into our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6165)|
| 1:42:47| What will be in front of you in December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6167)|
| 1:42:49| will include a 30% reduction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6169)|
| 1:42:51| within a quarter mile of transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6171)|
| 1:42:54| Will you say that one more time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6174)|
| 1:42:56| Yeah, say that from the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6176)|
| 1:42:58| You're talking about 30% reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6178)|
| 1:43:00| That's what our code currently allows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6180)|
| 1:43:03| is if you are, that's not something new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6183)|
| 1:43:06| it's our code currently allows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6186)|
| 1:43:07| if you are within a quarter mile of transit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6187)|
| 1:43:10| you can have a 30% reduction in parking requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6190)|
| 1:43:15| And we exempted that because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6195)|
| 1:43:18| in the proposal we put forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6198)|
| 1:43:20| we exempted that initially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6200)|
| 1:43:22| because we were taking parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6202)|
| 1:43:24| from the original requirement of two per unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6204)|
| 1:43:28| down to one per unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6208)|
| 1:43:29| We were already cutting it in half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6209)|
| 1:43:31| Well, now, we're putting it back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6211)|
| 1:43:35| So instead of exempting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6215)|
| 1:43:38| not allowing that additional 30% reduction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6218)|
| 1:43:41| we will be allowing that 30% reduction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6221)|
| 1:43:43| in the proposal that you will see before you do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6223)|
| 1:43:46| Well, what is your hesitation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6226)|
| 1:43:48| What is your hesitation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6228)|
| 1:43:52| I was just asking if Commissioner Hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6232)|
| 1:43:54| was considering or discussing something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6234)|
| 1:43:57| more than that 30%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6237)|
| 1:43:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6239)|
| 1:44:00| Do you want to speak on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6240)|
| 1:44:02| Remove it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6242)|
| 1:44:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6244)|
| 1:44:05| So, I'd like to throw out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6245)|
| 1:44:08| we've looked at it since this day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6248)|
| 1:44:10| We looked at the most current data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6250)|
| 1:44:12| for the city of Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231115?start=6252)|
