| 0:01:41| All right, seeing none, I'm asking Ms. Oster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=101)|
| 0:01:45| to please lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=105)|
| 0:01:49| Please rise and offer the proper salute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=109)|
| 0:01:54| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=114)|
| 0:01:59| and to the republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=119)|
| 0:02:02| one nation under God, indivisible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=122)|
| 0:02:05| with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=125)|
| 0:02:17| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=137)|
| 0:02:18| If I may have a moment of privilege, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=138)|
| 0:02:21| before we even set the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=141)|
| 0:02:24| We've had a difficult few days with the death of a local sheriff's deputy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=144)|
| 0:02:32| and also with the outbreak of the war in Israel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=152)|
| 0:02:37| Times have been very difficult in our country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=157)|
| 0:02:40| and I have asked our resident pastor, Commissioner Beeler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=160)|
| 0:02:45| if he'd be kind enough to please bring a few words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=165)|
| 0:02:49| just about what our most recent happenings have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=169)|
| 0:02:54| and lead us in prayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=174)|
| 0:02:56| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=176)|
| 0:02:59| Thank you, Madam Chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=179)|
| 0:03:01| and I would also take a moment to acknowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=181)|
| 0:03:07| that one of our own from the Gibbs community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=187)|
| 0:03:11| Specialist Jeremy Evans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=191)|
| 0:03:13| passed away in a military training accident in Alaska,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=193)|
| 0:03:18| and we want to remember his family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=198)|
| 0:03:21| and certainly honor him for his service to our country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=201)|
| 0:03:25| and keep them in our prayers as they grieve his loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=205)|
| 0:03:30| Just in thinking over the past couple of days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=210)|
| 0:03:32| about a few words to say in advance of our meeting tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=212)|
| 0:03:38| the Lord really impressed on my heart a scripture passage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=218)|
| 0:03:42| from Ezekiel chapter 22,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=222)|
| 0:03:46| and this is the Lord speaking through the prophet Ezekiel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=226)|
| 0:03:50| and this is what he says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=230)|
| 0:03:51| He says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=231)|
| 0:04:12| Officer Tucker Blakely was that man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=252)|
| 0:04:16| He stood in the gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=256)|
| 0:04:18| He stood between us and the violent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=258)|
| 0:04:23| He stood between the poor and needy and their oppressors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=263)|
| 0:04:27| He stood between the innocent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=267)|
| 0:04:29| and those who would have robbed them of their innocence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=269)|
| 0:04:32| And so as we think on this day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=272)|
| 0:04:34| about those who stand in the gap every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=274)|
| 0:04:38| and sacrifice their own safety on our behalf,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=278)|
| 0:04:43| may we never forget the ultimate sacrifice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=283)|
| 0:04:47| that Officer Blakely gave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=287)|
| 0:04:49| Would you join me in a word of prayer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=289)|
| 0:04:55| Father, I come to you just simply as a mouthpiece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=295)|
| 0:04:58| and thank you for the life of Tucker Blakely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=298)|
| 0:05:03| and thank you, God, for the way he lived it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=303)|
| 0:05:07| Thank you for the example that he was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=307)|
| 0:05:09| Thank you for his courage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=309)|
| 0:05:10| Thank you for his honor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=310)|
| 0:05:12| and all that he meant to those around him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=312)|
| 0:05:16| And Lord, we confess that we feel so inadequate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=316)|
| 0:05:21| in moments like this to offer any kind of help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=321)|
| 0:05:24| and so we simply lift his family to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=324)|
| 0:05:28| God, we lift up his wife, his son, his parents, siblings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=328)|
| 0:05:34| all those who loved him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=334)|
| 0:05:35| all the friends who loved him so dearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=335)|
| 0:05:37| We pray, God, that your grace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=337)|
| 0:05:39| would offer a supernatural comfort to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=339)|
| 0:05:43| a supernatural peace to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=343)|
| 0:05:45| in these days and weeks and months and even years ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=345)|
| 0:05:50| And, Father, let grief somehow dig a deeper place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=350)|
| 0:05:55| for love to flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=355)|
| 0:05:58| And, Father, we pray for his brothers and sisters in blue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=358)|
| 0:06:03| Lord, give them courage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=363)|
| 0:06:05| and help them to stand strong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=365)|
| 0:06:08| in the face of anxiety and confusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=368)|
| 0:06:12| and even sometimes fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=372)|
| 0:06:13| I pray, God, you would be their rock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=373)|
| 0:06:15| and you'd be the rock they stand on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=375)|
| 0:06:17| and the one who goes before them in every situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=377)|
| 0:06:21| And, Father, we lift up our sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=381)|
| 0:06:24| Father, I pray as he deals with those who are his people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=384)|
| 0:06:29| that you would help him lead with strength.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=389)|
| 0:06:33| God, help him lead with vision and courage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=393)|
| 0:06:37| and confidence, boldness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=397)|
| 0:06:41| Give him grace to lead as you'd have him lead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=401)|
| 0:06:46| And I ask you for all these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=406)|
| 0:06:48| and I thank you in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=408)|
| 0:06:50| In Jesus' name, amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=410)|
| 0:06:52| And amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=412)|
| 0:06:58| Thank you. Thank you for those words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=418)|
| 0:07:12| Hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=432)|
| 0:07:18| Mayor Jacobs, I appreciate you walking in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=438)|
| 0:07:21| I just recognized elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=441)|
| 0:07:23| and didn't want to overlook you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=443)|
| 0:07:25| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=445)|
| 0:07:27| All right, moving on to amendments to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=447)|
| 0:07:33| We have deferrals for item 27, 36, and 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=453)|
| 0:07:45| We have no withdrawals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=465)|
| 0:07:47| Our non-consent are currently 1 through 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=467)|
| 0:07:55| 21, 22, 52, 53, and 54.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=475)|
| 0:08:10| Item number 2 will be a presentation next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=490)|
| 0:08:18| And we've also had a request to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=498)|
| 0:08:22| not off of the consent agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=502)|
| 0:08:26| but if you will make a note of item 15 under education consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=506)|
| 0:08:32| we are going to also have a brief discussion after item 54,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=512)|
| 0:08:41| just a short discussion about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=521)|
| 0:08:46| Do I need to repeat any of these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=526)|
| 0:08:52| Commissioner Beeler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=532)|
| 0:08:54| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=534)|
| 0:08:56| Commissioner Schoonmaker's item, did it still need to be pulled off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=536)|
| 0:08:59| I believe it was 27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=539)|
| 0:09:01| Did you read 27?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=541)|
| 0:09:02| If you did, I missed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=542)|
| 0:09:03| Yes, 27 has been deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=543)|
| 0:09:04| That one does still need to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=544)|
| 0:09:06| It's been deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=546)|
| 0:09:07| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=547)|
| 0:09:08| It's been deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=548)|
| 0:09:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=549)|
| 0:09:11| Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=551)|
| 0:09:12| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=552)|
| 0:09:13| On item number 15,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=553)|
| 0:09:16| should the contingent from Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=556)|
| 0:09:19| stay to the end of the meeting so that that item can be heard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=559)|
| 0:09:23| Or do we want to have it during the regular agenda format?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=563)|
| 0:09:29| What's your preference, Commissioner Frazier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=569)|
| 0:09:33| I would hate for our folks from the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=573)|
| 0:09:37| having to stay until the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=577)|
| 0:09:40| If we could just pull it from consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=580)|
| 0:09:42| and have just a discussion, no motion or anything, just a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=582)|
| 0:09:45| All right, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=585)|
| 0:09:46| If there's no objection then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=586)|

| 0:12:00| at noon, to return a petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=720)|
| 0:12:03| Do not return one at 12.01, because you will be late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=723)|
| 0:12:05| Eighteen individuals have picked up thus far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=725)|
| 0:12:08| so we have had a busy first day of petitions being picked up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=728)|
| 0:12:13| Early voting will begin on Valentine's Day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=733)|
| 0:12:15| so you can take your sweetie or loved one to early vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=735)|

| 0:12:19| And it will run through February the 27th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=739)|
| 0:12:21| Election Day will be Super Tuesday, March the 5th, 2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=741)|
| 0:12:25| I just want to share two other quick pieces of business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=745)|
| 0:12:27| that I thought both the Commission as well as members of the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=747)|
| 0:12:30| may be interested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=750)|
| 0:12:32| First off, I will go ahead and tell everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=752)|
| 0:12:34| there will be a number of polling place changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=754)|
| 0:12:38| Election Day polling place changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=758)|
| 0:12:40| forthcoming from the Election Commission at its November 17th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=760)|
| 0:12:44| As always, the public is invited to attend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=764)|
| 0:12:47| and we will publicize those changes in as many places as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=767)|
| 0:12:50| including notifying each active voter if a change affects them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=770)|
| 0:12:54| And although I am not at liberty to discuss all of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=774)|
| 0:12:56| because I'm still in negotiations with some folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=776)|
| 0:12:59| I will tell you that because of the Town of Farragut's building closing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=779)|
| 0:13:03| for construction, that will be one that we're looking at alternative spots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=783)|
| 0:13:07| and actually one from Madam Chair Terry Hill's suggestion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=787)|
| 0:13:11| we will be suggesting that we move from Carnes Middle to Carnes Elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=791)|
| 0:13:15| because of ADA issues and basically making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=795)|
| 0:13:17| that we can get folks in and out of that place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=797)|
| 0:13:20| And then lastly, as we always do before large elections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=800)|
| 0:13:24| the Election Commission will be recruiting Election Day workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=804)|
| 0:13:27| for the 2024 election cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=807)|
| 0:13:29| I believe this is a good opportunity for community members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=809)|
| 0:13:32| interested in how elections operate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=812)|
| 0:13:34| and particularly those individuals skeptical of the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=814)|
| 0:13:37| to get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=817)|
| 0:13:39| I have many people working for me that were previously weary of the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=819)|
| 0:13:42| because of something they read online or something they saw on cable news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=822)|
| 0:13:46| I would ask that you please share with your constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=826)|
| 0:13:48| the opportunity to be a poll worker if the opportunity arises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=828)|
| 0:13:53| And with that, I thank you for your time very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=833)|
| 0:13:55| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=835)|
| 0:13:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=836)|
| 0:13:57| I've allowed Mr. Davis to do this because I believe he has a date with the judge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=837)|
| 0:14:01| for, was it an anniversary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=841)|
| 0:14:03| 24 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=843)|
| 0:14:05| Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=845)|
| 0:14:06| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=846)|

| 0:14:09| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=849)|
| 0:14:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=850)|
| 0:14:11| Moving on with our, well, before we move on with the regular agenda items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=851)|
| 0:14:16| as we had briefly discussed, item 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=856)|
| 0:14:20| If Madam Clerk, you would read that, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=860)|
| 0:14:24| Item number 15, R-23-10-209,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=864)|

| 0:14:38| located in Farragut at a cost of $4,892,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=878)|
| 0:14:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=884)|
| 0:14:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=885)|
| 0:14:46| And as a discussion item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=886)|
| 0:14:47| is there someone from the schools that could step forward for just a moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=887)|
| 0:14:50| please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=890)|
| 0:15:05| Would you state your name and residence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=905)|
| 0:15:07| Garfield Adams, Oak Ridge, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=907)|
| 0:15:10| Madam Chair, County Commissioners, good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=910)|
| 0:15:12| Yes, Mr. Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=912)|
| 0:15:14| I deeply apologize that I didn't give you a heads up on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=914)|
| 0:15:18| I think it will be relatively painless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=918)|
| 0:15:21| But on that, I'll turn the floor to Commissioner Frazier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=921)|
| 0:15:28| and then I have a comment also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=928)|
| 0:15:30| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=930)|
| 0:15:31| And thank you, Mr. Garfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=931)|
| 0:15:33| And also, I don't know if Mr. McPherson is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=933)|
| 0:15:35| but thank you all for your communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| First, I'm really glad that Knox County Schools is addressing the enrollment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=938)|
| 0:15:41| pressures in the Farragut schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=941)|
| 0:15:44| For as long as I've lived here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=944)|
| 0:15:46| there's been a discussion about overcapacity in the Farragut schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=946)|
| 0:15:50| So thank you all for addressing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=950)|
| 0:15:52| But on that note, I had a couple of questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=952)|
| 0:15:55| and just wanted to hear from you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=955)|
| 0:15:58| First, I wanted to ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=958)|
| 0:15:59| have there been any meetings that bring Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=959)|
| 0:16:03| Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=963)|
| 0:16:04| and even the Town of Farragut to the table to discuss the project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=964)|
| 0:16:08| If not, I would really like to see that happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=968)|
| 0:16:12| because it then leads to my next question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=972)|
| 0:16:16| Having been one of those community advocates for a new school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=976)|
| 0:16:21| I don't want us to have another Mill Creek scenario,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=981)|
| 0:16:24| in that Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=984)|
| 0:16:27| you kind of went forward with the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=987)|
| 0:16:30| and Knox County government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=990)|
| 0:16:33| we were kind of left holding the tab for a lot of multimillion dollar road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=993)|
| 0:16:37| improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=997)|
| 0:16:38| And so I really want to make sure that those conversations are being had on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=998)|
| 0:16:42| the front end versus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1002)|
| 0:16:44| and I know we're just in a preliminary phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1004)|
| 0:16:47| but I still think those discussions are important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1007)|
| 0:16:50| So if you could just address that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1010)|
| 0:16:51| and then I have a couple of more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1011)|
| 0:16:53| Certainly, Madam Chair, Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| First, I'd like to thank Commissioner Schoonmaker for all of his diligent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1016)|
| 0:16:59| hard work working directly with Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1019)|
| 0:17:01| and also our board member, Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1021)|
| 0:17:04| They've been very helpful in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1024)|
| 0:17:06| We've had several meetings with Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1026)|
| 0:17:09| We've worked with them hand in hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1029)|
| 0:17:11| I would also like to thank Chris Caldwell and Jim Snowden for all of their due| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1031)|
| 0:17:15| diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1035)|
| 0:17:16| We've also met with the town of Farragut on several occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1036)|
| 0:17:19| And so they have been an active participant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1039)|
| 0:17:23| as we've been searching for land for the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1043)|
| 0:17:26| It seems like, well, it has been roughly two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| So they have been very involved in moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1049)|
| 0:17:33| Moving forward, and I don't know if you were alluding to the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1053)|
| 0:17:37| but moving forward, we will certainly involve the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1057)|
| 0:17:40| We will certainly involve Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1060)|
| 0:17:42| We will certainly involve the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1062)|
| 0:17:45| And our board, what they will receive are several proposals in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1065)|
| 0:17:49| presentation that they can make a sound decision once we get the input from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1069)|
| 0:17:56| community members, the schools themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1076)|
| 0:18:00| and also the town of Farragut and Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| Do you know what type of school this will be and what the enrollment numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1083)|
| 0:18:08| might be and what enrollment numbers you hope to relieve from the Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1088)|
| 0:18:13| schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1093)|
| 0:18:14| I mean, will it be an elementary school, middle school, high school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1094)|
| 0:18:18| What are the discussions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1098)|
| 0:18:21| So there is no decision on what school this will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1101)|
| 0:18:24| The sense of urgency was securing land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1104)|
| 0:18:27| Currently, and I can share the numbers with you if you'd like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1107)|
| 0:18:30| but currently we are at capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1110)|
| 0:18:34| What we have found ourselves, the situation we have found ourselves in is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1114)|
| 0:18:38| temporary capacity, which we like to call learning cottages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1118)|
| 0:18:42| And so it's temporary, but we have been using that as permanent capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1122)|
| 0:18:47| So the goal is to alleviate capacity and remove portables from the actual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1127)|
| 0:18:55| school sites and ensure that we have capacity for future growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1135)|
| 0:19:00| We do have projected numbers as well, but the current numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1140)|
| 0:19:03| as they stand, we are over capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1143)|
| 0:19:06| Over capacity in elementary, middle, high school, all three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1146)|
| 0:19:10| Because the intermediate and the middle school are in one school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1150)|
| 0:19:16| we're at the point of over capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1156)|
| 0:19:19| So what we're looking at is, and that's because of the learning cottages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1159)|
| 0:19:25| so what we're looking at is what do we need for capacity for the middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1165)|
| 0:19:28| school, the elementary, and the primary as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1168)|
| 0:19:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1172)|
| 0:19:33| I appreciate you all being proactive in trying to secure the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1173)|
| 0:19:35| I'm just curious as to, I feel like you have to have some sort of idea of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1175)|
| 0:19:41| the student grade population that you hope to serve or to relieve the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1181)|
| 0:19:45| pressure from the existing schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1185)|
| 0:19:48| Also, I had reached out to Mr. McPherson and he gave me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1188)|
| 0:19:52| you were at the very preliminary stage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1192)|
| 0:19:54| but if you have any idea of what the operational budget will be for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1194)|
| 0:19:59| school, that's something that I think would be very interesting to know on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1199)|
| 0:20:06| this side of things before really trudging forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1206)|
| 0:20:09| even if it's just kind of a ballpark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1209)|
| 0:20:12| And then I did learn that the schools are paying for the property from bond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1212)|
| 0:20:15| proceeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1215)|
| 0:20:16| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1216)|
| 0:20:17| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1217)|
| 0:20:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1218)|
| 0:20:19| And then the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1219)|
| 0:20:21| This location really is just to reduce pressures from Farragut schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1221)|
| 0:20:26| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1226)|
| 0:20:28| This, well, we looked at several different locations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1228)|
| 0:20:32| roughly 24, I believe, different locations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1232)|
| 0:20:36| and this was the most suitable site to build a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1236)|
| 0:20:40| However, it is in an ideal location for the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1240)|
| 0:20:44| You said you looked at how many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1244)|
| 0:20:45| Roughly 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1245)|
| 0:20:46| 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1246)|
| 0:20:47| Were those all just in Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1247)|
| 0:20:49| or were they in sort of the west-northwest area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1249)|
| 0:20:52| We looked at the west-northwest area as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1252)|
| 0:20:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1254)|
| 0:20:55| Because I remember when we were advocating for Hardin Valley Middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1255)|
| 0:20:58| School and also the Gibbs Middle School that so much growth is extending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1258)|
| 0:21:01| west towards Watt Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1261)|
| 0:21:03| and at that time those studies showed that the Watt Road area were really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1263)|
| 0:21:07| ideal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1267)|
| 0:21:08| Has that location, that area been considered at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1268)|
| 0:21:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1273)|
| 0:21:14| Yes, we certainly looked at that area as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1274)|
| 0:21:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| Is it budgetary constraints as far as the amount of property or acreage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1277)|
| 0:21:20| that you need versus the allocation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1280)|
| 0:21:23| Suitable land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1283)|
| 0:21:24| Suitable land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1284)|
| 0:21:25| Suitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1285)|
| 0:21:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1286)|
| 0:21:27| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1287)|
| 0:21:28| And then do you have any idea what the target enrollment would be for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1288)|
| 0:21:30| the new school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1290)|
| 0:21:31| It would depend on what school that would be, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1291)|
| 0:21:34| So you could look at several different options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1294)|
| 0:21:37| You could look at a mega elementary school for 2,500 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1297)|
| 0:21:40| You could look at an elementary school from anywhere from 1,200 to 1,600| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1300)|
| 0:21:43| students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1303)|
| 0:21:44| You could look at a middle school for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1304)|
| 0:21:46| they currently have roughly 1,500 students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| so you would have a middle school for either 1,600 to 1,800 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1308)|
| 0:21:53| Thank you so much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1313)|
| 0:21:54| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1314)|
| 0:21:55| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1315)|
| 0:21:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1316)|
| 0:21:57| Thank you, Powerfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1317)|
| 0:21:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1318)|
| 0:21:59| Appreciate that very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1319)|
| 0:22:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1320)|
| 0:22:01| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1321)|
| 0:22:02| Hold on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1322)|
| 0:22:03| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1323)|
| 0:22:04| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1324)|
| 0:22:05| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1325)|
| 0:22:07| Let's see if it's working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1327)|
| 0:22:08| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1328)|
| 0:22:11| Mr. Adams, I just wanted to echo your statement about my counterpart in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1331)|
| 0:22:15| 5th District School Board member, Susan Horn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1335)|
| 0:22:18| because she really needs to be acknowledged for the time and effort that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1338)|
| 0:22:23| she put in behind the scenes to secure this property for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1343)|
| 0:22:28| Schools and to get it at a discount as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1348)|
| 0:22:33| There was just, she worked extremely hard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1353)|
| 0:22:37| and she's been a great asset to the community on the Knox County School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1357)|
| 0:22:42| Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1362)|
| 0:22:43| so I just wanted to make sure she got the lion's share of the credit on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1363)|
| 0:22:47| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1367)|
| 0:22:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1370)|
| 0:22:51| Thank you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1371)|
| 0:22:52| Appreciate the update very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1372)|

| 0:23:27| seconded by Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1410)|

| 0:23:44| Item number 3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1424)|
| 0:23:45| presentation of the quarterly Fire and Technical Rescue Committee report by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1425)|
| 0:23:50| Director Brent Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1430)|
| 0:23:56| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1436)|
| 0:23:59| Brent Seymour, 1630 Huron Street, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1439)|
| 0:24:06| This is a quarterly update on our fire and rescue agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1446)|
| 0:24:10| that are providing service inside Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1450)|
| 0:24:13| As you can see on the overhead, that's our breakdown of our run data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1453)|
| 0:24:18| about just under 4,000 medical calls for July, August, and September,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1458)|
| 0:24:23| about 1,700 what we consider other responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1463)|
| 0:24:28| So your lift assist, your hazardous materials calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1468)|
| 0:24:32| anything really that doesn't constitute a medical emergency or a fire emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1472)|
| 0:24:38| And then your fire department responses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| or your fire responses were about 595 there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1480)|
| 0:24:44| But you can also see the graph there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| just under 4,000 responses countywide for those three months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1486)|
| 0:24:51| were emergency medical calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1491)|
| 0:24:54| So our agencies are out here, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1494)|
| 0:24:57| handling the medical emergencies, dealing with the issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1497)|
| 0:25:00| stabilizing those patients, awaiting transport, and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1500)|
| 0:25:04| So the presentation you heard earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1504)|
| 0:25:07| these folks are a part of that presentation as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1507)|
| 0:25:10| and doing the job that they do out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1510)|
| 0:25:13| And sometimes they go unsung,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1513)|
| 0:25:15| so just acknowledging our paramedics and our EMTs on the engines out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1515)|
| 0:25:21| answering those medical calls as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1521)|
| 0:25:23| and helping those folks get the help they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1523)|
| 0:25:26| They're really doing a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1526)|
| 0:25:28| And to back that up, our agencies did a little over 4,000 hours of training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1528)|
| 0:25:32| in the last 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1532)|
| 0:25:34| I know when we see them out doing some type of rescue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1534)|
| 0:25:37| or a car wreck or something like that, they make it look easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1537)|
| 0:25:41| Well, they make those look easy because of the training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| that they have to put into that on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1543)|
| 0:25:47| And that's why they seem to go so seamless and so smooth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1547)|
| 0:25:51| because of what they're out there doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| And to recognize some of our fire departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1555)|
| 0:25:57| Obviously, many of you have heard we had a tornado incident back in August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1557)|
| 0:26:03| that affected our Carnes community greatly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1563)|
| 0:26:05| and also other West Knox County communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1565)|
| 0:26:09| but the primary area of touchdown was in the Carnes community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1569)|
| 0:26:15| You know, a 3.8-mile-wide path,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1575)|
| 0:26:18| high wind speeds, level crossing apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1578)|
| 0:26:21| was one of the main areas of damage that you folks have been given in a presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1581)|
| 0:26:27| But we want to recognize our Carnes Fire Department right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1587)|
| 0:26:30| They handled that incident swiftly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1590)|
| 0:26:32| They put the right amount of resources on the scene in the right amount of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1592)|
| 0:26:36| to mitigate that incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1596)|
| 0:26:37| One of the things that we have practiced before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1597)|
| 0:26:41| obviously we've done exercises in our EOC that involve weather issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1601)|
| 0:26:47| One of the things we don't practice often| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1607)|
| 0:26:51| is the fact that a weather event or any event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1611)|
| 0:26:55| completely tasks a single agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| You know, usually when we exercise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| you'll pull a little piece from this agency, a little piece from that agency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1620)|
| 0:27:03| and we work out the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1623)|
| 0:27:06| One of the reasons that our Carnes firefighters did so well right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1626)|
| 0:27:11| that completely tasked that department as a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1631)|
| 0:27:15| because of the destruction in that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1635)|
| 0:27:18| And they handled that superior with really limited or no issues at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1638)|
| 0:27:25| Obviously we had an after-action report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1645)|
| 0:27:27| and we went back and talked about things that we'd like to do different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| No finger-pointing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| It was, hey, if we had one of these or if we had one of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| or if somebody could have did this, we think it would have went better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1654)|
| 0:27:38| So that was a really good communication on that after-action report for our Carnes folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1658)|
| 0:27:43| Knox County Rescue, big things happening there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1663)|
| 0:27:47| We launched a SAR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1667)|
| 0:27:49| You'll see SAR, Search and Rescue Team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1669)|
| 0:27:51| Now, that team is, I'll give you an example of a mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1671)|
| 0:27:56| Someone gets lost on House Mountain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1676)|
| 0:27:59| and they can't find their way back to the trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1679)|
| 0:28:02| You have an elderly person maybe that walks away from an assisted living facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1682)|
| 0:28:08| and wanders into the woods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1688)|
| 0:28:10| Depending on where they are, that may be a huge task to go find those folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1690)|
| 0:28:18| and especially retrieve them from an area where they may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1698)|
| 0:28:21| So that's a team that we are very proud of in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1701)|
| 0:28:24| They are working hand-in-hand with the Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1704)|
| 0:28:28| They're working hand-in-hand with Knoxville Police Department's SAR team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1708)|
| 0:28:31| and even have been contacted by the National Park Service to do training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1711)|
| 0:28:37| and have other resources available should something like that occur in the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1717)|
| 0:28:42| So we're very excited about that team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1722)|
| 0:28:45| and having Knox County represented in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1725)|
| 0:28:49| We're tickled about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1729)|
| 0:28:52| You'll see Rural Metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1732)|
| 0:28:57| The picture there represents a team on House Mountain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1737)|
| 0:29:01| Again, kind of the SAR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1741)|
| 0:29:03| We knew where this person was who had an ankle injury,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1743)|
| 0:29:06| so those folks that are trained in that type of activity actually went up the trail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1746)|
| 0:29:11| and brought that individual down and transported that person for treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1751)|
| 0:29:19| Several projects going on at Rural Metro as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1759)|
| 0:29:26| One of the biggest things we're proud of, and I'm proud of it too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1766)|
| 0:29:29| because that's the community I live in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1769)|
| 0:29:32| Rural Metro has taken delivery of a new fire truck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1772)|
| 0:29:35| and as I spoke with Captain Bagwell earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1775)|
| 0:29:37| that truck will be put into service one week from today in the Gibbs community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1777)|
| 0:29:42| So that's my neighborhood, so I'm pretty fired up about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1782)|
| 0:29:45| In my former life, I actually worked at that firehouse up there several times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1785)|
| 0:29:50| and that's a really good group of folks up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1790)|
| 0:29:53| They really do a great job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| and that's a well-deserved community for a brand-new fire truck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1795)|
| 0:29:59| that will also put a piece into the reserve fleet for Rural Metro| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1799)|
| 0:30:04| to take a little bit of the strain off some of the operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1804)|
| 0:30:08| Our Seymour folks, very honorable mention for Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1808)|
| 0:30:14| The chaplain at Seymour, Adam Linsenbigler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1814)|
| 0:30:17| was presented with one of the state awards for his service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1817)|
| 0:30:21| doing his chaplain duties for Seymour Fire Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1821)|
| 0:30:25| Very proud of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1825)|
| 0:30:26| It was the only volunteer department to be recognized at that event statewide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1826)|
| 0:30:33| and that came right out of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| So we're pretty proud of that, excited for that, excited for Adam,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1835)|
| 0:30:40| and those folks are doing really good things down there in Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1840)|
| 0:30:43| One of the big things about October, it's Fire Prevention Month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1843)|
| 0:30:47| so you'll see a lot of, if you haven't already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1847)|
| 0:30:50| you'll see a lot of fire prevention activities going on around the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1850)|
| 0:30:54| We have several open houses that have been going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1854)|
| 0:30:57| and are continuing to go on over the next couple of weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1857)|
| 0:31:00| so I encourage you to get out to one of those in your community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1860)|
| 0:31:03| and visit and show the support there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1863)|
| 0:31:08| And there's a lot of education events going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1868)|
| 0:31:11| and this is really one of the times of year that fire departments get out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1871)|
| 0:31:14| and make contact and do, we do life-changing work every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1874)|
| 0:31:19| but this is really where you get out and you impact folks in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1879)|
| 0:31:23| maybe teach a life lesson, save somebody's life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| five years down the road you'll never know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| But an education component that someone hears at an open house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1888)|
| 0:31:31| or a public education event really does great work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1891)|
| 0:31:35| and most of the time goes unnoticed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| because obviously we never hear a year down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| that something we learned at a fire station open house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| helped us get out of our house fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1903)|
| 0:31:46| So again, just be cognizant of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1906)|
| 0:31:49| get out and visit some open houses in your communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1909)|
| 0:31:52| because one of the things we would ask, as you guys do every time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1912)|
| 0:31:55| is when you're out talking to your constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| just encourage them to support the fire departments in their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1917)|
| 0:32:01| I tried to be a little shorter than the 2.30 report you got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1921)|

| 0:32:24| So it's my understanding that Mr. Hamby was elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1944)|
| 0:32:27| to the Emergency Medical Service, the EMS board for the state, for a term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1947)|

| 0:32:38| So go 28, get some ice cream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1958)|

| 0:32:43| so they may have about 1,000 people there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1963)|
| 0:32:46| It was well attended last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=1966)|

| 0:35:34| on our Knox County Ethics Commission Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2134)|
| 0:35:39| I believe that you all have the resumes in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2139)|
| 0:35:46| I had been asked, and I'm happy to do it, and we'll also go over it again next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2146)|
| 0:35:52| for the board members and also for the candidates, about the procedure that will be used since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2152)|
| 0:35:58| we have two nominees, and this is, in fact, the way it will proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2158)|
| 0:36:05| The clerk will call the roll, and as your name is called, you may nominate a candidate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2165)|
| 0:36:10| or pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2170)|
| 0:36:11| Once we have gone down the roll, the chair will look for a motion to cease nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2171)|
| 0:36:17| The clerk will again call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2177)|
| 0:36:20| This time, you will say the name of the candidate in which you would like to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2180)|
| 0:36:25| If a candidate receives a majority, that person will be appointed to the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2185)|
| 0:36:31| If there is no majority, the candidate with the lowest number of votes will drop off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2191)|
| 0:36:36| and we will repeat the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2196)|
| 0:36:40| Madam Chair, I have a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2200)|
| 0:36:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2204)|

| 0:37:09| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2229)|
| 0:37:10| I just wanted a quick clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2230)|
| 0:37:12| We will appoint each seat separately, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2232)|
| 0:37:15| We'll have a vote for the first one, then we'll start the whole process over, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2235)|
| 0:37:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2240)|

| 0:37:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2243)|
| 0:37:25| Are there any more comments or questions on the procedure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2245)|
| 0:37:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2251)|
| 0:37:34| As you all have noticed, we have Ms. Sharon sitting in for Drusilla tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2254)|
| 0:37:40| She has been out this week, so there's been perhaps a glitch or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2260)|
| 0:37:46| I cannot say for certain that every person that sent in an application for the Ethics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2266)|
| 0:37:54| Committee was notified that they could be here tonight and that they could also speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2274)|
| 0:38:02| So as I call these names, I'm inviting them forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2282)|
| 0:38:07| I'll give them three minutes to speak and open the floor to any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2287)|
| 0:38:15| If a candidate is not here tonight, please keep in mind it may be because they were not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2295)|
| 0:38:22| appropriately notified about it, but they will be given a chance to speak next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2302)|
| 0:38:28| Is there any objection to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2308)|
| 0:38:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2312)|

| 0:38:51| If you'd please come forward and state your name and residence, and we will give you three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2331)|
| 0:38:56| minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2336)|
| 0:38:57| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2337)|
| 0:38:58| Thank you, Madam Chair, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2338)|
| 0:39:00| My name is Dr. Jesse R. Cragwell, and I live at 10368 Harrison Springs Lane at Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2340)|
| 0:39:06| 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2346)|
| 0:39:08| And good afternoon, and again, thank you for considering me for the Ethics Committee vacancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2348)|
| 0:39:12| I've applied essentially for two primary reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2352)|
| 0:39:15| The first is I believe that transparency, accountability, and due process are essential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2355)|
| 0:39:19| functions of an effective democratic government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2359)|
| 0:39:22| When citizens are aware of government officials and what they're doing, then they're more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2362)|
| 0:39:25| confident in the decisions that are being made on their behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2365)|
| 0:39:29| However, when public officials operate outside of those established parameters, the mechanisms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2369)|
| 0:39:34| of accountability then serve to protect the institution of government and ensure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2374)|
| 0:39:38| individuals don't abuse those powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2378)|
| 0:39:39| And that's where I believe this committee comes into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2379)|
| 0:39:43| As a citizen, I believe that I can help ensure public employees conduct themselves according| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2383)|
| 0:39:47| to the policies and the procedures that are supposed to govern their behavior in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2387)|
| 0:39:52| And I also believe that it's important that we ensure due process, which is to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2392)|
| 0:39:57| that there is equitable treatment of all individuals, regardless of their position within society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2397)|
| 0:40:02| But then secondly, and more personally, the reason why I'm applying is that I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2402)|
| 0:40:05| I'm somewhat confident in applying for one of these vacancies because I, too, am a public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2405)|
| 0:40:09| servant, serving as both a federal employee and a state employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2409)|
| 0:40:12| As a professor of political science at Pellissippi State Community College, I fully understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2412)|
| 0:40:16| the need for people to trust those who have been elected or those who have been appointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2416)|
| 0:40:21| into public positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2421)|
| 0:40:22| But similarly, as a 20-year veteran in the United States military, I'm intimately aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2422)|
| 0:40:27| of the complexities and the difficulties that are associated with stewarding power that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2427)|
| 0:40:32| is granted to individuals in the public sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2432)|
| 0:40:34| And so by serving on this committee, I believe that I can provide a necessary service to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2434)|
| 0:40:38| both the people of the county, but also the institutions of government that govern our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2438)|
| 0:40:42| daily lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2442)|
| 0:40:43| And so with that, I welcome any questions that you have regarding my qualifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2443)|
| 0:40:46| or my interest in this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2446)|
| 0:40:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2449)|
| 0:40:50| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2450)|
| 0:40:51| Do we have any questions of this candidate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2451)|
| 0:40:56| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2456)|
| 0:40:57| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2457)|
| 0:41:00| Mr. Cragwell, are you on social media, or any type of media?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2460)|
| 0:41:05| Simply to the extent, one social media that I have is Instagram.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2465)|
| 0:41:10| Yeah, well, part of being part of that, to me, part of the ethics of media is that under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2470)|
| 0:41:18| your social media, or anyone's social media, or blogs, or whatever, you've got to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2478)|
| 0:41:25| to sit up here and judge somebody else in your social media, your blogs, your things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2485)|
| 0:41:32| like that come into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2492)|
| 0:41:34| And I just wanted to see if you had one, I want to know what it is, so I can go and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2494)|
| 0:41:38| look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2498)|
| 0:41:39| Full disclosure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2499)|
| 0:41:40| Well, Instagram is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2500)|
| 0:41:41| Full disclosure, it's an Instagram account that I record videos of me scaring my children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2501)|
| 0:41:46| I do not post anything outside of those videos, so there is no public communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2506)|
| 0:41:52| It is, I scare my kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2512)|
| 0:41:54| That's my Instagram handle, so it's out there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2514)|
| 0:41:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2519)|
| 0:42:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2523)|
| 0:42:04| Thank you, madam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2524)|
| 0:42:06| Thank you, madam chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2526)|
| 0:42:08| Dr. Cragwell, have you lived at your current address for almost 10 years now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2528)|
| 0:42:15| Yes, sir, it'll actually be 10 years in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2537)|
| 0:42:18| And I noticed you have a very, very extensive educational background in political science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2538)|
| 0:42:25| You teach classes in political science, undergraduate courses, and American government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2545)|
| 0:42:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2552)|
| 0:42:34| Everyone sitting here today is an elected official in Knox County, and it's, we wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2554)|
| 0:42:41| be sitting in our position if people didn't go to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2561)|
| 0:42:45| And so I'm a little perplexed when the Knox County Election Commission sent me the background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2565)|
| 0:42:51| on your voting record, and it shows for the last 10 years, you've not voted in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2571)|
| 0:42:58| at all, and it says you just registered to vote at Ball Camp Elementary School on June| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2578)|
| 0:43:05| of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2585)|
| 0:43:06| That's correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2586)|
| 0:43:07| Is there a reason for somebody that knows government and political science why you would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2587)|
| 0:43:12| not want to exercise your right to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2592)|
| 0:43:15| Well, I completely understand that, and I think that that's a very fair question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2595)|
| 0:43:19| The reason why I have not voted is because I believe that the commission that I took| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2599)|
| 0:43:22| as an officer in the United States Army requires me to uphold the laws that have been commissioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2602)|
| 0:43:27| over me by the officers that are appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| And for personal reasons, I've chosen not to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2610)|
| 0:43:33| It's not that I don't advocate for those individuals to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| I also think that it's important for me to be impartial in the classroom and for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2615)|
| 0:43:38| very same ability that you have to look at my voting record, so can my students do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2618)|
| 0:43:44| and I want to make sure that they can't ever see me as being advocating one political side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2624)|
| 0:43:47| or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2627)|
| 0:43:48| It doesn't mean that I don't have personal opinions, I just don't feel that it's required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| that I need to advocate or that I need to express those reasons in the public sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2630)|
| 0:43:56| or for voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2636)|
| 0:43:57| So, that's a personal decision that I've made, it's not something that I disagree with, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2637)|
| 0:44:01| just something that, as I've been an officer in the United States Army, I think that it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2641)|
| 0:44:04| important for me to be above reproach and to not give the side of impartiality for one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2644)|
| 0:44:09| side or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2649)|
| 0:44:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2650)|
| 0:44:11| And then, when did you leave the armed services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| I'm still in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2653)|
| 0:44:14| Still in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2654)|
| 0:44:15| Yeah, I'm a lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserve right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2655)|
| 0:44:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2657)|
| 0:44:21| Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| Mr. Quagwall, thank you for being here and for putting your name in the hat for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2665)|
| 0:44:29| appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2669)|
| 0:44:30| I do have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2670)|
| 0:44:33| Please describe an instance where a decision you made may not have been the popular decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2673)|
| 0:44:40| but was the right decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2680)|
| 0:44:43| Is that in my current position or just in general?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2683)|
| 0:44:47| In general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2687)|
| 0:44:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2688)|
| 0:44:49| You can use it how you wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2689)|
| 0:44:50| Well, right now, I've actually had to go through a situation where I serve as the chair of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2690)|
| 0:44:53| a subcommittee that's responsible for reviewing all of the learning outcomes for social and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2693)|

| 0:45:03| And there are a number of individuals within several colleges that felt that it was important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2703)|
| 0:45:08| for us to advocate for learning outcomes that actually deviate from what the Tennessee Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2708)|
| 0:45:13| of Regents has required us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2713)|
| 0:45:16| It was the less popular decision because it was forcing us, or at least encouraging us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2716)|
| 0:45:20| to go against the policies that were established over us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2720)|
| 0:45:23| And so, I had to make the decision that we weren't going to address a number of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2723)|
| 0:45:26| issues because of the position that I had in the subcommittee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2726)|
| 0:45:30| And so, despite the fact that there were some strong calls for us to make some changes to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2730)|
| 0:45:37| the learning outcomes because of the policies that are in place that do govern our institution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2737)|
| 0:45:41| and do govern the work on our subcommittee, I felt that it was important for me to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2741)|
| 0:45:45| sure that I did not break or violate any of those rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2745)|
| 0:45:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2749)|
| 0:45:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2750)|
| 0:45:51| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2751)|
| 0:45:52| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2752)|
| 0:45:53| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2753)|
| 0:45:54| Thank you for your service to our country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2754)|
| 0:45:55| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2755)|
| 0:46:00| What do you think the most important role is, if you were selected to be part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2760)|
| 0:46:06| Ethics Committee, what do you think the most important element of your position will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2766)|
| 0:46:12| over a four-year period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2772)|
| 0:46:15| I think there's a difference between the letter of the law and the spirit of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2775)|
| 0:46:19| And I know that there are a lot of legal policies and procedures that have been put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2779)|
| 0:46:22| in place and ensuring that when we look at a particular issue or when we look at what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2782)|
| 0:46:28| the role of this committee is supposed to fulfill, there are going to be instances where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2788)|
| 0:46:32| we have to make hard decisions where we're trying to understand the intent behind what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2792)|
| 0:46:35| was being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2795)|
| 0:46:36| So, I think that it's important for us to understand and allow due process to be carried| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2796)|
| 0:46:40| out to ensure that these individuals are given the opportunity to present their case and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2800)|
| 0:46:48| also to ensure that what they're doing and the performance that they're, or the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2808)|
| 0:46:53| to perform their positions, that they're again adhering to these policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2813)|
| 0:46:56| So I think that we also have to remember there is the letter of the law, that these policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2816)|
| 0:47:00| and these procedures are governing the work that you do and the work of a number of public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2820)|
| 0:47:04| citizens, or public officials, but at the same time, there's the spirit behind that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2824)|
| 0:47:08| and we just have to remember to keep that fine, delicate balance in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2828)|
| 0:47:11| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2831)|
| 0:47:12| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2832)|
| 0:47:16| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2836)|

| 0:47:46| I've tried to stay away, I would introduce myself, but I didn't want to spread the joy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2866)|
| 0:47:50| to all of you guys and gals tonight, so I didn't have a speech prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2870)|
| 0:47:54| I didn't know I was supposed to do that, but regardless, I'll do what I do best, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2874)|
| 0:47:58| is talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2878)|
| 0:47:59| I put in for the Ethics Committee because I believe, I echo his sentiments, the gentleman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2879)|
| 0:48:04| that came before me, I believe in fair and transparent government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2884)|
| 0:48:08| I also believe that elected officials, both elected and appointed, as well as the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2888)|
| 0:48:13| falling under their purview, should be held accountable and do have a responsibility to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2893)|
| 0:48:18| the people on which they serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2898)|
| 0:48:21| That's one of the primary reasons that I chose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2901)|
| 0:48:24| I also believe in impartial and fair transparency, as far as any accusations may go, as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2904)|
| 0:48:31| if someone were to receive an ethics complaint, I believe that we need to be fair and just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2911)|
| 0:48:36| to those people as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2916)|
| 0:48:38| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2918)|
| 0:48:42| Do we have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2922)|
| 0:48:44| Mr. Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2924)|
| 0:48:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2927)|
| 0:48:50| I thought you were going to defer to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2930)|
| 0:48:55| Ms. Gibson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2935)|
| 0:48:57| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2937)|
| 0:48:58| You have probably one of the most amazing track records as far as a voter registration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2938)|
| 0:49:05| card that I've ever seen in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2945)|
| 0:49:08| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2948)|
| 0:49:09| The record stopped back when you were 21 years old, but I don't believe you've missed a county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2949)|
| 0:49:15| primary or a county general or a presidential election since you were 21 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2955)|
| 0:49:23| So that's very impressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2963)|
| 0:49:24| I just wanted you to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2964)|
| 0:49:26| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2966)|
| 0:49:27| And it's because I lived out of state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2967)|
| 0:49:28| That means a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2968)|
| 0:49:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2969)|
| 0:49:30| Well, we appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2970)|
| 0:49:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2971)|

| 0:49:36| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2976)|
| 0:49:37| I believe that was four years ago, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2977)|
| 0:49:38| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2978)|
| 0:49:42| Same question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2982)|
| 0:49:43| Social media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2983)|
| 0:49:44| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2984)|
| 0:49:45| As an ethics member, you're going to sit in judgment, and it's kind of hard to judge if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2985)|
| 0:49:51| you're judging people on social media any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2991)|
| 0:49:54| Are you on social media?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2994)|
| 0:49:56| And if so, explain which ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2996)|
| 0:49:58| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2998)|
| 0:49:59| I'm on a lot of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3001)|
| 0:50:05| But the Snapchat is, like, I'll echo him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3005)|
| 0:50:07| I stalk my children, and I also only post videos of my cats with amazing music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3007)|
| 0:50:13| But it's under my real name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3013)|
| 0:50:15| I have nothing to hide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3015)|
| 0:50:16| I'm fully, I'm an open book, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3016)|
| 0:50:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3018)|
| 0:50:22| Commissioner Lee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3022)|
| 0:50:25| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3025)|
| 0:50:28| I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3028)|
| 0:50:29| You retired from the sheriff's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3029)|
| 0:50:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3032)|
| 0:50:35| You look too young to retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3035)|
| 0:50:37| I did take an early retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3037)|
| 0:50:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3039)|
| 0:50:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3040)|
| 0:50:41| I did almost 22 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3041)|
| 0:50:42| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3042)|
| 0:50:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3043)|
| 0:50:44| 22 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3044)|
| 0:50:45| Thank you for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3045)|
| 0:50:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3046)|
| 0:50:49| Commissioner Durrett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3049)|
| 0:50:51| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3051)|
| 0:50:53| Ms. Gibson, I'll ask the same question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3053)|
| 0:50:55| Please describe an instance where a decision you've made may not have been the popular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3055)|
| 0:51:00| decision, but was the right one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3060)|
| 0:51:04| Going back to being an employee of the sheriff's office for almost 22 years, I had an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3064)|
| 0:51:08| to serve as the employee representative for the Merit System Council of the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3068)|
| 0:51:13| Sheriff's Office, which basically is the governing body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3073)|
| 0:51:17| You know, because Tennessee is an at-will state, we can't have unions or anything, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3077)|
| 0:51:21| the Knox County Sheriff's Office has the Merit System Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3081)|
| 0:51:25| I was selected, actually, by Commissioner Jay to serve on that with one other employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3085)|
| 0:51:30| And basically, we worked on some policy and procedure updates and some rules and some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3090)|
| 0:51:35| regulations that we wanted to take a look at and maybe change or get rid of, or change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3095)|
| 0:51:41| the language in some of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3101)|
| 0:51:43| Long story short, I voted for the employees rather than how certain other people wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3103)|
| 0:51:52| me to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3112)|
| 0:51:53| It was the right vote for the employees, and I stand by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3113)|
| 0:51:57| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3117)|

| 0:52:01| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3121)|
| 0:52:02| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3122)|

| 0:52:07| on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3127)|
| 0:52:08| We didn't always see eye-to-eye, but we worked together closely along with the other committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3128)|
| 0:52:12| members, and it was productive and helpful, I think, in the long run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3132)|
| 0:52:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3137)|
| 0:52:18| It was very educational.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3138)|
| 0:52:19| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3139)|
| 0:52:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3140)|
| 0:52:21| And hard stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3141)|
| 0:52:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3142)|
| 0:52:23| You have been around Knox County politics for, I mean, if you've been part of the Sheriff's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3143)|
| 0:52:31| Office, then you've been around Knox County politics for 20-plus years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3151)|
| 0:52:34| And on this role as an Ethics Committee member, you're essentially going to sit in judgment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3154)|
| 0:52:40| of some folks who may be the elected officials that you served alongside with or know very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3160)|
| 0:52:48| closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3168)|
| 0:52:49| How would you approach that if you had a close relationship or if you had to sit in judgment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3169)|
| 0:52:59| of somebody that you did work alongside with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3179)|
| 0:53:01| As I previously stated, I'm always transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3181)|
| 0:53:05| I'm an open book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3185)|
| 0:53:06| But one of my mottos and how I was raised is I don't judge somebody based on your opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3186)|
| 0:53:11| or the opinion of others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3191)|
| 0:53:12| I judge somebody based on the facts and circumstances as they're presented to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3192)|
| 0:53:17| And as I'm a researcher by nature, so I will dig into something as much as I can in order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3197)|
| 0:53:22| to discover the facts and circumstances behind the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3202)|
| 0:53:25| And that's where my judgment will fall, not based on the opinions or the talk of anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3205)|
| 0:53:31| else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3211)|
| 0:53:32| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3212)|
| 0:53:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3214)|
| 0:53:35| Commissioner Oster?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3215)|
| 0:53:38| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3218)|
| 0:53:40| Thank you, Crystal, for your service to the Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3220)|
| 0:53:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3223)|
| 0:53:44| And for somebody who's sitting up here on commission now that sat with you on the Merit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3224)|
| 0:53:50| Council, I saw you make the hard decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3230)|
| 0:53:54| And, you know, it's always easy for people to show good character and leadership when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3234)|
| 0:54:00| it's easy, but it's not when it's tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3240)|
| 0:54:03| And that's where you really see who somebody is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3243)|
| 0:54:06| So I can speak personally to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3246)|
| 0:54:09| I've always been impressed with your spunk and determination and to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3249)|
| 0:54:15| And I think because we're kind of same wavelength with the spunk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3255)|
| 0:54:21| But I appreciate you reaching out to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3261)|
| 0:54:24| I also sit on the Ethics Committee, and I feel like it is extremely important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3264)|
| 0:54:30| And I feel like people need to take it extremely serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3270)|
| 0:54:35| And sort of kind of echoing Commissioner Jay, even though him and I didn't always see eye| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3275)|
| 0:54:43| to eye on the Merit Council, I think I saw what you did to do the work that needed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3283)|
| 0:54:51| be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3291)|
| 0:54:52| And so I just wanted to applaud you in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3292)|
| 0:54:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3295)|
| 0:54:56| And just kind of thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3296)|
| 0:54:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3298)|

| 0:55:02| Commissioner Lee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3302)|
| 0:55:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3305)|
| 0:55:08| Seeing no other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3308)|
| 0:55:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3310)|
| 0:55:11| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3311)|

| 0:55:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3314)|
| 0:55:16| The next candidate is Marcus Hilliard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3316)|
| 0:55:23| Mr. Hilliard, your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3323)|
| 0:55:25| You have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3325)|
| 0:55:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3327)|
| 0:55:28| Marcus Hilliard, 1106 Glory Maple Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3328)|
| 0:55:33| Good evening, Madam Chair and Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| I could sit up here and spout a host of reasons for why I'm interested in serving on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3335)|
| 0:55:39| committee, but I'll give you my top three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| Civic engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3341)|
| 0:55:42| I moved back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3342)|
| 0:55:43| I went to school at Tennessee from 2005 to 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3343)|
| 0:55:46| And I moved my wife and I back here a couple years ago, and I wanted to become more involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3346)|
| 0:55:51| in a community in a way that I felt I could truly help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3351)|
| 0:55:54| And this sounds like the perfect opportunity for me to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3354)|
| 0:55:57| I understand and realize the importance of being more than just a living citizen in Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3357)|
| 0:56:01| County, and the chance to throw my hat in the ring to potentially serve on this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3361)|
| 0:56:04| to me was a no-brainer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3364)|
| 0:56:06| Second, the importance of ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3366)|
| 0:56:08| It's incredibly critical as morality and fairness and justice are at the bedrock of our foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3368)|
| 0:56:13| In my professional life, I serve as an athletics administrator at UT, and ethics is important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3373)|
| 0:56:18| as we serve a host of different constituency groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3378)|
| 0:56:20| So we got fans, donors, student-athletes, coaches, campus leaders, a lot of opinions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3380)|
| 0:56:24| a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3384)|
| 0:56:26| So making sure we are carrying ourselves to the highest standard and having that level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3386)|
| 0:56:30| of accountability is more than just lip service to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3390)|
| 0:56:32| As it relates to this committee, we owe it to everyone in the community to hold our elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3392)|
| 0:56:36| officials and employees at the highest ethical standard, no different than we would hold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3396)|
| 0:56:40| ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3400)|
| 0:56:41| I'd love to be a part of a group that ensures that we're doing everything possible to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3401)|
| 0:56:45| sure we're adhering to the right ethical standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3405)|
| 0:56:47| And finally, but last but certainly not least, serving others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3407)|
| 0:56:50| My mom was a long-time educator, and my dad was a long-time college football coach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3410)|
| 0:56:54| And so at our heart and our bedrock of our family, we're serving people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3414)|
| 0:56:59| So that's where the foundation of serving leadership in my mind and my heart comes from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3419)|
| 0:57:03| The essence of this committee, I believe, is to serve the community by ensuring that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3423)|
| 0:57:06| accountability is set in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3426)|
| 0:57:08| I feel I could add a unique perspective to the already great work this committee is currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3428)|
| 0:57:12| doing, given my unique background and experiences as an athletics administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3432)|
| 0:57:16| And last but certainly not least, I have no ulterior goals or motives here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3436)|
| 0:57:21| I appreciate all the work that you all do, but I have absolutely no desire to run for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3441)|
| 0:57:24| public office or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3444)|
| 0:57:26| I'm honestly just a Knox County citizen who would like to do my part, serve my community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3446)|
| 0:57:31| and give back to the community that has done a lot for me in such a short part of the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3451)|
| 0:57:35| of my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3455)|
| 0:57:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3456)|
| 0:57:37| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3457)|
| 0:57:39| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3459)|
| 0:57:41| Commissioner Spoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3461)|
| 0:57:43| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3463)|
| 0:57:46| I was impressed when I pulled your voting record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3466)|
| 0:57:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3470)|
| 0:57:51| Because I noticed that when you were here as a student at the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3471)|
| 0:57:56| you went and voted, which was great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3476)|
| 0:57:59| And just so that you know, this is not anything that you did wrong, but because you moved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3479)|
| 0:58:06| and you were in Orlando and Durham and all that, they purged your voting records because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3486)|
| 0:58:13| obviously he had moved away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3493)|
| 0:58:16| But what impressed me the most is when you moved back to town, within less than 60 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3496)|
| 0:58:21| you re-registered to vote again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3501)|
| 0:58:23| So that was very impressive, and I commend you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3503)|
| 0:58:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3506)|
| 0:58:28| Commissioner Durant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3508)|
| 0:58:30| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3510)|
| 0:58:32| Mr. Hilliard, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3512)|
| 0:58:35| I will ask you the same question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3515)|
| 0:58:38| Please describe an instance where a decision you made may not have been the most popular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3518)|
| 0:58:44| decision, but was the right one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3524)|
| 0:58:46| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3526)|
| 0:58:47| I go back in my mind and I think about one of my mentors who says, you know, anytime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3527)|
| 0:58:50| you have to make a decision, a tough one, you know, it's always going to be simple,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3530)|
| 0:58:54| but it ain't going to ever be easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| In my role in athletics, we have rules that we govern ourselves to by the NCAA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3536)|
| 0:59:02| And in a lot of cases, or in some cases, some people don't like to follow those rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3542)|
| 0:59:07| And unfortunately, in this particular case, there was a very, very popular person that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3547)|
| 0:59:11| then chose not to follow the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3551)|
| 0:59:13| But at any rate, you know, my role within the department is to make sure that our student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3553)|
| 0:59:17| athletes and our staff members understand the importance of following those rules and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3557)|
| 0:59:21| maintaining that level of ethical standard there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3561)|
| 0:59:24| And so we chose to go in a separate direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3564)|
| 0:59:26| I had the final decision on that call, and it was an easy one in my mind because, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3566)|
| 0:59:30| at the end of the day, we're going to follow the rules and make sure we do things the right way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3570)|
| 0:59:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3574)|
| 0:59:35| Appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3575)|
| 0:59:37| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3577)|

| 0:59:53| I am on formerly Twitter as X, primarily for work purposes, just trying to do the good work of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3593)|
| 0:59:58| pushing Evolve's branding forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3598)|
| 1:00:00| And then I'm also on Facebook, where I just do a lot of not reconnaissance work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3600)|
| 1:00:05| But when we hire people, I kind of go online to make sure I screen people to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3605)|
| 1:00:09| they're up to the standard of the University of Tennessee that we'd like to have in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3609)|
| 1:00:12| employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3612)|
| 1:00:16| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3616)|
| 1:00:18| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3618)|
| 1:00:20| Thank you for applying to be part of the Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3620)|
| 1:00:23| When I was looking at your professional affiliations, I noticed you've served on several boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3623)|
| 1:00:30| And how would you connect your service on those boards to what your service might be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3630)|
| 1:00:38| in an ethical role?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3638)|
| 1:00:40| Because it's a different kind of board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3640)|
| 1:00:42| Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3642)|
| 1:00:43| Again, going back to it, in certain cases when you're on the board and you're charged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3643)|
| 1:00:47| with making some decisions like that, sometimes the decisions aren't exactly the easy ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3647)|
| 1:00:51| but they're really simple, meaning that you've got a lot of people, stakeholders that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3651)|
| 1:00:55| want to make sure you take in mind and consideration and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3655)|
| 1:00:58| And sometimes your decision may not be the most popular decision, but at the end of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3658)|
| 1:01:02| day, if you can make the right decision, that you believe it in your heart, you can sleep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3662)|
| 1:01:06| well on it at nighttime, and it's for the betterment of the group or for the organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3666)|
| 1:01:10| then you've made the right decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3670)|
| 1:01:11| And so I think those opportunities with my service on those boards provide me very well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3671)|
| 1:01:15| to be a member of this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3677)|
| 1:01:18| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3678)|
| 1:01:21| Seeing no other lights, thank you so much for applying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3681)|
| 1:01:24| Thank you for the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3684)|

| 1:01:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3686)|
| 1:01:30| The next candidate is Sean Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3690)|
| 1:01:39| And commissioners, I believe you have a handout also that Sharon shared beforehand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3699)|
| 1:01:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3708)|
| 1:01:49| Before we start, can I just ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3709)|
| 1:01:52| I was under the impression it was five minutes, not three, and I prepared accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3712)|
| 1:01:58| Well, if I spoke to you that way or emailed you that way, I deeply apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3718)|
| 1:02:05| It is three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3725)|
| 1:02:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3727)|
| 1:02:08| So if you'd please state your name and place of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3728)|

| 1:02:16| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3736)|
| 1:02:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3737)|
| 1:02:18| I did prepare a handout since I was prepared for five minutes instead of three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3738)|
| 1:02:22| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3742)|
| 1:02:23| No, there's no offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3743)|
| 1:02:24| I'm just going to skip a few things on that, and we'll come back to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3744)|
| 1:02:27| I appreciate you giving me the opportunity to speak tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3747)|
| 1:02:31| I moved to the Democratic People's Republic of Farragutstan three years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3751)|
| 1:02:35| grateful to be a refugee from my former state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3755)|

| 1:02:44| I quickly learned Farragut's problems are not much different than everywhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3764)|
| 1:02:50| The more I investigated the problems, the more I uncovered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3770)|
| 1:02:54| I've lost track at the number of issues that I've uncovered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3774)|
| 1:02:57| I put together an addendum number one of issues that I've brought up and can substantiate, if asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3777)|
| 1:03:04| in terms of either unethical or what I believe is illegal activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3784)|
| 1:03:08| I have been rewarded for the last three years by being libeled and defamed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3788)|
| 1:03:12| including emails that some of you received about me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3792)|
| 1:03:16| And the way I would frame this, and I would ask everybody who's going to have the opportunity to vote for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3796)|
| 1:03:22| if a dog chases a rabbit but you don't see that rabbit, you have a completely different impression of what is going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3802)|
| 1:03:31| You can listen to rumors and innuendo of people who have never talked to me and never met me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3811)|
| 1:03:37| and they'll have their opinions, which they're allowed to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3817)|
| 1:03:41| But if you have a question, feel free to reach out to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3821)|
| 1:03:45| Don't feel anything's fair game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3825)|
| 1:03:48| I'm very transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3828)|
| 1:03:49| Some of you who have talked to me know I don't pull any punches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3829)|
| 1:03:52| And some of the things I've been rewarded for in my efforts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3832)|
| 1:03:57| I received a death threat over the yard display I've put up that threatened myself and my minor children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3837)|
| 1:04:04| I've had my car doxxed where my license plate was put up on social media with my actual license plate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3844)|

| 1:04:17| But you want to know what kind of person I am, you watch how I have stood up and what I have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3857)|
| 1:04:24| And I stand behind what I've brought up in Farragut, and I'm not ashamed of it at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3864)|
| 1:04:29| because what's going on there is really wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3869)|
| 1:04:32| And we're going to find out in the very near future how bad the problem is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3872)|
| 1:04:37| In terms of why I wanted to do this, I have two reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3877)|
| 1:04:44| I think my background and experience is very different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3884)|
| 1:04:47| I've never had a government job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3887)|
| 1:04:49| Last time I had a job was 20-plus years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3889)|
| 1:04:53| And the second thing is I always leave something better than I find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3893)|
| 1:04:58| I have not been in the best of health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3898)|
| 1:05:01| I spent 20 years suffering from chronic pain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3901)|
| 1:05:04| I almost died February 1, 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3904)|

| 1:05:15| It's all written out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3915)|
| 1:05:16| My time is up, so I don't want to go over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3916)|
| 1:05:18| But I want to leave this place better than where I found it, and I think my background will do that for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3918)|

| 1:06:12| I've said a lot of things, and there will be at least a dozen or two dozen on there that people may say, ah, you know, I don't like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3972)|
| 1:06:19| Some of you folks in the county commission have been a guest on the show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3979)|
| 1:06:22| So that's really it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3982)|
| 1:06:24| I'm not a big fan of social media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3984)|
| 1:06:26| I don't have anything on my phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3986)|
| 1:06:27| I don't use apps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3987)|
| 1:06:29| I don't believe in any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3989)|
| 1:06:31| But that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3991)|
| 1:06:32| It's really only Facebook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3992)|
| 1:06:39| Commissioner Durant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=3999)|
| 1:06:40| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4000)|
| 1:06:42| Mr. Murphy, I'll ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4002)|
| 1:06:44| I keep saying question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4004)|
| 1:06:45| I'm not really asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4005)|
| 1:06:46| Please make the statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4006)|
| 1:06:48| Please describe an instance where a decision you made may not have been a popular decision, but it was definitely the right one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4008)|
| 1:06:55| I want to thank you for asking me that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4015)|
| 1:06:56| I really look forward to answering this all night listening to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4016)|
| 1:07:00| I moved to Farragut three years ago, found things going on that I think are wrong and have labeled them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4020)|
| 1:07:07| It's in that addendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4027)|
| 1:07:08| You can read it in terms of other information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4028)|
| 1:07:11| And I decided late last year that I was going to take on what was going on in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4031)|
| 1:07:17| And in April of this year, I put up a yard display, which is in the other addendum that I've put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4037)|
| 1:07:23| Out of that, I got taken to court, found guilty of something that the town attorney admitted I didn't do, fined $1,800.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4043)|
| 1:07:33| I've spent $70,000 in legal bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4053)|
| 1:07:36| I was taken by an attorney for $30,000 to deal with a legal matter that is going to come up in the very near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4056)|
| 1:07:46| I've put my money where my mouth is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4066)|
| 1:07:49| I've had my home violated, my safety violated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4069)|
| 1:07:54| I have an individual who has written you folks who has admitted publicly she's driven by my house like 60 times, I think is what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4074)|
| 1:08:01| I live on a corner of two dead ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4081)|
| 1:08:04| And I stood up and said, I like this place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4084)|
| 1:08:08| I don't like what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4088)|
| 1:08:10| And I did something highly unusual for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4090)|
| 1:08:13| And I'll freely admit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4093)|
| 1:08:14| I definitely marched to my own beat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4094)|
| 1:08:16| And I put up a yard display criticizing the people who run Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4096)|
| 1:08:20| And then I put a second one up after they ran me through a kangaroo court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4100)|
| 1:08:23| And I've had to do this before because sometimes people who get in positions of power may have it go to their head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4103)|
| 1:08:31| And I had that happen in my former state as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4111)|
| 1:08:33| And time will prove me right in Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4113)|
| 1:08:37| But to put that kind of money and that kind of abuse on the line tells, I think tells you what kind of person I am| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4117)|
| 1:08:44| and that what I'm willing to do to stand up and say this is wrong, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4124)|
| 1:08:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4130)|
| 1:08:52| Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4132)|
| 1:08:56| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4136)|
| 1:08:58| Mr. Murphy, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4138)|
| 1:09:00| Of course I have information and stuff of what's going on with Farragut and yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4140)|
| 1:09:08| And I guess with going through the process of what you're going through and what you have been going through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4148)|
| 1:09:18| I'm kind of shocked that you want to put yourself through this process because it is a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4158)|
| 1:09:25| I guess I'm kind of wondering, do you feel like that you would be able to be totally transparent, for one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4165)|
| 1:09:38| but also very fair in an ethics situation if you were to deal with somebody who had issues with you like what you're dealing with right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4178)|
| 1:09:49| I'm really glad you asked that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4189)|
| 1:09:52| There's a couple parts to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4192)|
| 1:09:55| In terms of who I am as a person, talk to me, to actually deal with me, talk to people who have dealt with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4195)|
| 1:10:01| I am a very straight shooter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4201)|
| 1:10:03| I grew up outside of New York City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4203)|
| 1:10:05| I'm a type A personality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4205)|
| 1:10:08| I'm actually very blunt, and it's just that it's my style.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4208)|
| 1:10:12| I have always believed in ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4212)|
| 1:10:15| There's right, there's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4215)|
| 1:10:17| I've never worked for government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4217)|
| 1:10:18| I've always been in the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4218)|
| 1:10:21| If I owed somebody money, I paid it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4221)|
| 1:10:24| And a lot of these things can become personal if you let them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4224)|
| 1:10:30| I look at it and say, the process is so critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4230)|
| 1:10:35| I complain, and I do loudly, I do regularly, and you can hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4235)|
| 1:10:39| Some of you have stood in front of me on our little show where I was doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4239)|
| 1:10:44| I don't like nonsense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4244)|
| 1:10:46| I didn't like it when I saw it in my former state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4246)|
| 1:10:48| I didn't like it when I saw it in Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4248)|
| 1:10:51| And I stood up and said, this is wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4251)|
| 1:10:54| There's no surprises with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4254)|
| 1:10:57| And what's most important is the integrity of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4257)|
| 1:11:01| One of the gentlemen before talked about due process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4261)|
| 1:11:04| If one of you came in front of me and the ethics committee, whether I liked you or whether I don't like you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4264)|
| 1:11:12| or anything in between, you still, it is more important that you get treated through due process than my personal feelings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4272)|
| 1:11:21| And I can turn them off very easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4281)|
| 1:11:24| I always have joked I'm a big pop culture guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4284)|
| 1:11:29| So I'm a cross between a Klingon and a Romulan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4289)|
| 1:11:32| And that's the real me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4292)|
| 1:11:35| I'd love to meet the guy that some of these people say I am because I've never behaved like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4295)|
| 1:11:40| And it certainly doesn't fit me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4300)|
| 1:11:42| But this is so important here because of how we're growing as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4302)|
| 1:11:47| I came from a place that murdered its economic opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4307)|
| 1:11:51| And that's part of why so many people are coming here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4311)|
| 1:11:54| And I saw all the nonsense that went on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4314)|
| 1:11:58| I got elected in 2011, took on the most corrupt zoning chairman in the history of Connecticut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4318)|
| 1:12:04| And two years later, he never ran for office again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4324)|
| 1:12:07| I won't deny it was an ugly mess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4327)|
| 1:12:10| But we were right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4330)|
| 1:12:12| And you can get, you can, there are people who like me who think I'm a wild, different kind of guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4332)|
| 1:12:18| I do my own thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4338)|
| 1:12:19| There are people who don't like me for the same reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4339)|
| 1:12:21| One thing you will guarantee you can collateral with a bank and always bank on is I will be straight and I will be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4341)|
| 1:12:30| And my personal feelings are never more important than our rule of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4350)|
| 1:12:36| And I'm very critical of what a lot has gone on in our country, not our county, our country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4356)|
| 1:12:42| And I will call, better or worse, I call that out and say my piece on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4362)|
| 1:12:46| But that, if you want to know really what you're going to get with me, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4366)|
| 1:12:50| Straight shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4370)|
| 1:12:51| Call me up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4371)|
| 1:12:52| Ask me a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4372)|
| 1:12:53| I'll give it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4373)|
| 1:12:54| I don't know how to do that soft-spoken stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4374)|
| 1:12:56| Some people are teaching me, but I'm not doing very well with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4376)|
| 1:12:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4379)|
| 1:13:00| I appreciate your openness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4380)|
| 1:13:04| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4384)|
| 1:13:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4385)|
| 1:13:10| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4390)|
| 1:13:11| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4391)|
| 1:13:13| Thank you for applying for the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4393)|
| 1:13:17| From some of your own information you've sent us and some of the information I've seen online of your work in Connecticut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4397)|
| 1:13:29| as you've said, you're a pretty straightforward, even in-your-face kind of person who is fairly aggressive when you're passionate about something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4409)|
| 1:13:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4419)|
| 1:13:41| How do you expect to – most of the things that I've seen that you've presented are very individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4421)|
| 1:13:49| It's you against the government or against Farragut or against whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4429)|
| 1:13:56| When you serve on the ethics committee, you're going to be on a board of, I think, seven or nine with other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4436)|
| 1:14:02| It's not just about you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4442)|
| 1:14:04| You've got to collectively work as a board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4444)|
| 1:14:06| How do you think you're going to do that when your style is very aggressive and you're one of seven votes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4446)|
| 1:14:14| You've got a lot of good questions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4454)|
| 1:14:17| The first thing I would respond is it depends on the scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4457)|
| 1:14:22| If you're dealing with me in business, I'm a negotiator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4462)|
| 1:14:27| I may negotiate hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4467)|
| 1:14:29| If you saw me in a social setting – and I don't think any of you have seen it – I'm a complete introvert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4469)|
| 1:14:35| I'm not sociable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4475)|
| 1:14:37| So it depends on what you see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4477)|
| 1:14:40| I would ask you, if it's okay, to explain what you mean by what you saw in Connecticut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4480)|
| 1:14:45| because if you saw something online, you heard one side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4485)|
| 1:14:50| What went on there is there was a small town called Woodbury, which has been talked about in Farragut forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4490)|
| 1:14:56| I moved there, and in 2011 I got elected to the zoning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4496)|
| 1:15:01| The chairman was doing illegal things, and it's very different standards than Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4501)|
| 1:15:06| Neither good nor bad, just different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4506)|
| 1:15:08| By the time we had outed him and we'd replaced some members who weren't doing their job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4508)|
| 1:15:12| he resigned and never ran for office again because he was doing favors for his friends and not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4512)|
| 1:15:21| And he did some very dirty things to me, which is all public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4521)|
| 1:15:27| And he got me once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4527)|
| 1:15:29| I got upset, lost my cool, walked out of a room and said, I've had enough, I quit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4529)|
| 1:15:33| Never did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4533)|
| 1:15:35| I also, one thing which I've never said publicly but I'm happy to, I was dying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4535)|
| 1:15:41| I was very sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4541)|
| 1:15:42| I was in chronic pain from a car accident for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4542)|
| 1:15:46| I almost died from my gallbladder blowing up inside of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4546)|
| 1:15:51| I was 39 years old, and I was less than a day from dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4551)|
| 1:15:56| And I have this angioma in my head, which every once in a while, it messes with me a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4556)|
| 1:16:04| So I had no idea any of that was going on through all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4564)|
| 1:16:07| I was really sick, and by only the miracle of God am I still standing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4567)|
| 1:16:12| And did I do everything right back then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4572)|
| 1:16:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4574)|
| 1:16:15| But I did the best I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4575)|
| 1:16:17| We got other members on the commission, and I decided that it was time for other people to take over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4577)|
| 1:16:23| If you deal with me in a professional setting like this, and I've worked in politics since 2006,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4583)|
| 1:16:31| you find I'm a totally different person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4591)|
| 1:16:33| I'm actually very laid back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4593)|
| 1:16:36| There are professional standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4596)|
| 1:16:38| I think your question is excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4598)|
| 1:16:40| Even if you had no knowledge of me or any knowledge, it's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4600)|
| 1:16:43| Because, well, this guy, he's a very, he's a bombastic type A personality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4603)|
| 1:16:48| Does he work well with others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4608)|
| 1:16:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4609)|
| 1:16:50| I've worked with some of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4610)|
| 1:16:51| I've had you on my show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4611)|
| 1:16:52| You can hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4612)|
| 1:16:53| I've worked with groups in Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4613)|
| 1:16:55| I'm actually one of many people in Farragut, and we all have a, it's a fun culture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4615)|
| 1:16:59| It's very different personalities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4619)|
| 1:17:02| But what matters here on the ethics is, from my world, I see in the business world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4622)|
| 1:17:08| never been in government before, I've been elected to a local position, but that's it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4628)|
| 1:17:13| is we have to be, as a community, we're going to a different place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4633)|
| 1:17:18| Because people are moving here, the economy is coming here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4638)|
| 1:17:21| and businesses are going to look at Knox County and say, if they see certain things going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4641)|
| 1:17:27| oh, well, you know, that's not good, that doesn't sound right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4647)|
| 1:17:31| All I can tell you is, at the end of the day, for those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4651)|
| 1:17:34| and I allow any of the county commissioners who I have spoken to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4654)|
| 1:17:37| if we've worked together on something, you're welcome to share that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4657)|
| 1:17:40| There are people in other offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4660)|
| 1:17:43| I've worked with David White, our alderman in Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4663)|
| 1:17:46| And I just, how you see me now is how I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4666)|
| 1:17:50| I get loud and animated, and that's, if you've ever dealt with Italians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4670)|
| 1:17:54| if you've ever dealt with Eastern Europeans, or people from New York or New England,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4674)|
| 1:17:58| we just talk this, you know, do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4678)|
| 1:18:00| I'm Irish, but I do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4680)|
| 1:18:01| I talk with my hands a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4681)|
| 1:18:03| It's a habit I've learned over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4683)|
| 1:18:05| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4685)|
| 1:18:06| Thank you for the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4686)|
| 1:18:08| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4688)|
| 1:18:09| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4689)|
| 1:18:12| Mr. Murphy, do you hold some kind of title in Great Britain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4692)|
| 1:18:18| I'm not sure why you asked that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4698)|
| 1:18:19| I've never been to Great Britain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4699)|
| 1:18:21| Okay, well, because in your formal email to the Knox County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4701)|
| 1:18:25| it says, His Majesty, Sean Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4705)|
| 1:18:28| Oh, that's a joke that I do on the show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4708)|
| 1:18:32| We talk about pronouns, which are in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4712)|
| 1:18:35| And I didn't realize I had included that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4715)|
| 1:18:38| I have some emails that get signed with that sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4718)|
| 1:18:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4720)|
| 1:18:41| So it's a joke with what we've got going on in the world today that we believe there's 130 genders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4721)|
| 1:18:46| And if you listen to the show, I always get addressed as that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4726)|
| 1:18:49| It's honestly a parody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4729)|
| 1:18:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4732)|
| 1:18:53| Because the question was, because then it says here that you've not been employed for well over 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4733)|
| 1:18:58| and I thought maybe you got some kind of stipend from the royal family or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4738)|
| 1:19:02| since you addressed yourself as His Majesty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4742)|
| 1:19:05| I don't think that's a reasonable conclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4745)|
| 1:19:07| I would invite you, since you're going to pass judgment on me, to listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4747)|
| 1:19:11| I'm not passing judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4751)|
| 1:19:12| I'm just saying the statement says I've not been employed for well over 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4752)|
| 1:19:15| I was just trying to connect dots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4755)|
| 1:19:17| Did you want to fill in the dots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4757)|
| 1:19:19| Yeah, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4759)|
| 1:19:20| I wanted to let you finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4760)|
| 1:19:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4762)|
| 1:19:23| So I've addressed the humor of pronouns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4763)|
| 1:19:29| Having been not employed doesn't mean I'm unemployed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4769)|
| 1:19:35| It means I don't work for somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4775)|
| 1:19:37| I've been self-employed since early 2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4777)|
| 1:19:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4782)|
| 1:19:43| And I guess my last question is, in this document that you prepared for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4783)|
| 1:19:49| it has the three banners in your front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4789)|
| 1:19:53| Are those the original banners that were posted in your front yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4793)|
| 1:19:57| or did you take the original ones down and replace them with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4797)|
| 1:20:01| No, those are the original ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4801)|
| 1:20:02| Those are the original ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4802)|
| 1:20:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4803)|
| 1:20:04| So what's gone on is there have been a whole lot of misinformation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4804)|
| 1:20:12| flat-out lies at times about what I have or haven't done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4812)|
| 1:20:16| Outside of Brian Hornback, no one has covered any of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4816)|
| 1:20:20| And what I wanted to do, since people are contacting the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4820)|
| 1:20:25| telling people that some very derogatory things about me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4825)|
| 1:20:29| I'm going to respond directly and in a straightforward way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4829)|
| 1:20:33| This is what I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4833)|
| 1:20:35| This is why I did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4835)|
| 1:20:37| There's a reason why I did this, and it actually succeeded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4837)|
| 1:20:41| because everybody who is in Farragut now knows how messed up things have been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4841)|
| 1:20:47| how the laws have been ignored,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4847)|
| 1:20:49| how I got taken to court over an ordinance that the town admitted during court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4849)|
| 1:20:57| I did not violate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4857)|
| 1:20:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4859)|
| 1:21:00| My next question, like I ask everybody else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4860)|
| 1:21:03| is the voter registration information provided by the Knox County Election Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4863)|
| 1:21:09| And it looks like you moved into your home in April of 2020?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4869)|
| 1:21:15| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4875)|
| 1:21:16| I bought the home in April of 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4876)|
| 1:21:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4878)|
| 1:21:19| But you registered then in September of 2020 to begin voting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4879)|
| 1:21:25| just before the presidential election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4885)|
| 1:21:27| It would have been illegal because I hadn't been living here until then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4887)|
| 1:21:30| so I couldn't lawfully vote for six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4890)|
| 1:21:32| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4892)|
| 1:21:33| Just clarifying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4893)|
| 1:21:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4894)|
| 1:21:35| And you've got a good voting record, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4895)|
| 1:21:37| May I add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4897)|
| 1:21:38| Because there's a voting history before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4898)|
| 1:21:40| Well, we were looking at Knox County, so that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4900)|
| 1:21:44| I voted in every primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4904)|
| 1:21:46| We had referendums where I was from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4906)|
| 1:21:48| I missed two in ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4908)|
| 1:21:50| Again, different system, different state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4910)|
| 1:21:53| There weren't a lot of contested primaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4913)|
| 1:21:55| I voted in every election and encouraged about 120 people to vote in our primary process in the last year or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4915)|
| 1:22:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4925)|
| 1:22:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4926)|
| 1:22:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4927)|
| 1:22:08| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4928)|
| 1:22:10| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4930)|

| 1:22:14| It's very appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4934)|
| 1:22:16| And our last candidate is Joey Ruffalo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4936)|
| 1:22:20| Ruffalo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4940)|
| 1:22:23| Ruffalo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4943)|
| 1:22:25| He's going to tell me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4945)|
| 1:22:33| It's Joey Ruffalo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4953)|
| 1:22:35| Oh, Joey, I'm so sorry, Mr. Ruffalo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4955)|
| 1:22:37| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4957)|
| 1:22:38| It's pronounced so many different ways everywhere I go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4958)|
| 1:22:40| It's no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4960)|
| 1:22:41| We have your name, your residence, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4961)|
| 1:22:43| Yes, it's 11319 Campbell Lakes Drive in Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4963)|
| 1:22:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4966)|
| 1:22:47| And you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4967)|
| 1:22:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4968)|
| 1:22:49| Dear members of the Knox County Commission, thank you for giving us all the opportunity to speak before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4969)|
| 1:22:55| As a fairly new resident of Knox County in Tennessee, I'm excited for the opportunity to give back to my community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4975)|
| 1:23:01| I can say that everyone that I've met has been welcoming and embracing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4981)|
| 1:23:04| and I'm excited to finally have the opportunity to give back and contribute to my community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4984)|
| 1:23:08| which has welcomed me with open arms, and I'm ready to serve and make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4988)|
| 1:23:12| I'm honored to have this opportunity to address you today and express my interest in serving as a member of the Knox County Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4992)|
| 1:23:18| As a responsible, ethical, and law-abiding citizen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=4998)|
| 1:23:21| I believe I can contribute positively to the committee while carrying out the duties and responsibilities required of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5001)|
| 1:23:27| This important committee of diverse citizens from all types of professional backgrounds provides a necessary check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5007)|
| 1:23:32| in the checks and balances of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5012)|
| 1:23:34| Citizen involvement in government, especially at the local level, is paramount in ensuring that our system of government survives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5014)|
| 1:23:40| I've always believed that ethical behavior is the foundation of a successful and sustainable community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5020)|
| 1:23:45| and if appointed to the committee, I'll work tirelessly to create awareness about ethical behavior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5025)|
| 1:23:49| and to promote it within our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5029)|
| 1:23:52| I take ethics very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5032)|
| 1:23:54| I was taught at a young age by my father what it was meant to be ethical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5034)|
| 1:23:57| to judge someone on their actions alone and not who they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5037)|
| 1:24:00| I grew up with my father being blind my entire life, and I'm very much influenced by the way he interacted with people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5040)|
| 1:24:06| He truly lived by a judge-someone-by-their-character standard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5046)|
| 1:24:09| and his military background reinforced his seek-the-facts-before-making-a-conclusion practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5049)|
| 1:24:15| Again, another attribute I'm happy to have copied from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5055)|
| 1:24:19| My qualifications for membership in the Ethics Committee include my work experience as a small business owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5059)|
| 1:24:23| and a financial coach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5063)|
| 1:24:25| My wife and I ran a pet-sitting business for over 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5065)|
| 1:24:28| We were consistently rated within the top five in our local community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5068)|
| 1:24:32| When you enter another person's home to take care of their pet or family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5072)|
| 1:24:36| that person is putting a great deal of faith and trust in you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5076)|
| 1:24:39| Having an ethical standard is paramount to success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5079)|
| 1:24:42| As a financial coach, I not only act as a fiduciary to my clients but also as a sounding board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5082)|
| 1:24:47| Clients can be vulnerable, and again, they put their trust in you to guide them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5087)|
| 1:24:52| Throughout this career, I've been required to take numerous ethics classes to obtain an MBA and various certifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5092)|
| 1:24:58| Lastly, I wanted to acknowledge my 10-year-old niece, Juliana, as inspiration for me getting more involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5098)|
| 1:25:04| She recently decided on her own that she would run for student council secretary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5104)|
| 1:25:08| She designed her own signs and slogan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5108)|
| 1:25:11| She even went first, as opposed to me who goes last, when giving her speech in front of the entire school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5111)|
| 1:25:16| She's one of the shyest kids I've known, and for her to want to do this and take it as far as she did inspired me to do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5116)|
| 1:25:22| Even though she lost, she wasn't mad or upset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5122)|
| 1:25:25| She told me she would just try again next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5125)|
| 1:25:28| As adults, we're supposed to lead by example, but here I am following hers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5128)|
| 1:25:32| Not letting an opportunity to serve my community go to waste,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5132)|
| 1:25:35| and perhaps allow me to take the lead again as a role model to her and her sister, Leah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5135)|
| 1:25:40| I'd like to thank you for the opportunity to express my interest in serving as a member of the Knox County Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5140)|
| 1:25:45| I'm confident that my passion for ethical behavior, coupled with my experience, will prove to be an asset to the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5145)|
| 1:25:52| I look forward to your favorable consideration, and any questions you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5152)|
| 1:25:57| Thank you. Questions, commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5157)|
| 1:26:02| Mr. Daly? Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5162)|
| 1:26:05| Same question, Mr. Ruffalo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5165)|
| 1:26:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5168)|
| 1:26:09| Social media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5169)|
| 1:26:10| Yes, I'm very active on social media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5170)|
| 1:26:12| I have Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5172)|
| 1:26:18| They are all under my business name and are used for those purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5178)|
| 1:26:27| Commissioner Durant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5187)|
| 1:26:29| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5189)|
| 1:26:30| Mr. Ruffalo, I feel you on the name mispronunciation all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5190)|
| 1:26:34| It's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5194)|
| 1:26:36| I will ask, I will have you do the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5196)|
| 1:26:40| Please describe an instance where a decision you made may not have been the most popular decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5200)|
| 1:26:45| but it was definitely the right one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5205)|
| 1:26:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5207)|
| 1:26:48| So it's a personal situation dealing with my father, who recently passed away from cancer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5208)|
| 1:26:53| I lived in California at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5213)|
| 1:26:55| They lived in New Jersey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5215)|
| 1:26:56| All his family members were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5216)|
| 1:26:59| There were several doctors in the family, but I was in charge of his care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5219)|
| 1:27:02| So dealing with elders, aunts and uncles who felt that they had his best interests at heart rather than my decisions, essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5222)|
| 1:27:13| So focusing on dealing with doctors, getting the right care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5233)|
| 1:27:17| and earning their respect along the process of how his care was managed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5237)|
| 1:27:22| In the beginning, it was very rough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5242)|
| 1:27:24| I was getting phone calls all day, every day from everybody telling me what I should do and not what I needed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5244)|
| 1:27:30| And what I needed to do was what was right for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5250)|
| 1:27:32| And I sleep well at night knowing that I did the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5252)|
| 1:27:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5256)|
| 1:27:37| Well, thank you for sharing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5257)|
| 1:27:38| Thank you for asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5258)|
| 1:27:40| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5260)|
| 1:27:41| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5261)|
| 1:27:43| Very impressive resume with your accomplishments from a financial side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5263)|
| 1:27:49| That's pretty amazing what you've done over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5269)|
| 1:27:52| Thanks, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5272)|
| 1:27:54| Obviously, you're fairly new to Knox County, but I was impressed to see that you had, after arriving here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5274)|
| 1:28:02| had gone ahead and registered to vote and get to vote at Farragut Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5282)|
| 1:28:07| And you did vote in the presidential election in November of 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5287)|
| 1:28:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5294)|
| 1:28:15| Can I clarify that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5295)|
| 1:28:16| I actually registered to vote right when I got here, but there was a misspelling in my name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5296)|
| 1:28:19| so I was unable to vote in the primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5299)|
| 1:28:22| So I had to re-register, and I was unable to vote there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5302)|
| 1:28:25| I can relate to that, the misspelling of your last name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5305)|
| 1:28:29| Well, my handwriting is very poor sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5309)|
| 1:28:33| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-231016?start=5313)|
