| 1:35:36| will be hard to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5736)|
| 1:35:37| but our goal is all of it built at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5737)|
| 1:35:42| And I think it's been mentioned before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5742)|
| 1:35:44| the market is using a more conservative estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5744)|
| 1:35:48| The estimate that we've gotten preliminarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5748)|
| 1:35:50| for what the private sector would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5750)|
| 1:35:52| would be around $142 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5752)|
| 1:35:54| And so we're hopeful that we'll be able to exceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5754)|
| 1:35:58| the estimates that Mark has put before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5758)|
| 1:36:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5762)|
| 1:36:03| Thank you, Mr. Boyd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5763)|
| 1:36:05| Thank you, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5765)|
| 1:36:06| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5766)|
| 1:36:07| I'm gonna go to first round questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5767)|
| 1:36:09| before I come back to those who've asked a question before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5769)|
| 1:36:12| So I'm gonna call on Commissioner Beeler next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5772)|
| 1:36:20| Thank you, Chairman Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5780)|
| 1:36:22| My question is actually pretty broad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5782)|
| 1:36:24| because I feel like what we're discussing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5784)|
| 1:36:27| is really the evolution of a vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5787)|
| 1:36:29| And I love to hear people articulate vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5789)|
| 1:36:32| So I wonder, Mr. Boyd, if you wouldn't mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5792)|
| 1:36:34| to just share maybe when this vision started for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5794)|
| 1:36:39| and how it found its home in this location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5799)|
| 1:36:44| versus maybe some other places like the Riverfront| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5804)|
| 1:36:46| or the World's Fair side of downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5806)|
| 1:36:49| just kind of share how this overall vision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5809)|
| 1:36:52| found a home in this spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5812)|
| 1:36:54| That is a broad question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5814)|
| 1:36:55| I want to be mindful of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5815)|
| 1:36:56| So I'll try to be very succinct as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5816)|
| 1:36:59| I've had a love for baseball for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5819)|
| 1:37:02| And one of the things I love about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5822)|
| 1:37:03| is how it brings communities together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5823)|
| 1:37:05| And it represents a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5825)|
| 1:37:06| I've been to 45 major league stadiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5826)|
| 1:37:09| And the ones that do it best are downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5829)|
| 1:37:12| And they bring people from all parts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5832)|
| 1:37:14| of the community together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5834)|
| 1:37:16| They have the same, they share local foods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5836)|
| 1:37:18| and local culture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5838)|
| 1:37:19| And it's just a great community building event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5839)|
| 1:37:22| I love my hometown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5842)|
| 1:37:23| Put those two things together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5843)|
| 1:37:25| And I used to always dream of having a major league team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5845)|
| 1:37:27| When I got the opportunity to buy the Smokies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5847)|
| 1:37:31| it was a dream come true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5851)|
| 1:37:32| I love where we're at, but I'm a Knoxville boy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5852)|
| 1:37:35| And the idea of being able to bring a team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5855)|
| 1:37:37| to my hometown was a dream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5857)|
| 1:37:40| When my wife started a business in downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5860)|
| 1:37:43| with Boyd's Jig and Rail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5863)|
| 1:37:45| I realized this area has so much opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5865)|
| 1:37:47| And so we started looking at some property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5867)|
| 1:37:51| and found a site that seemed ideal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5871)|
| 1:37:55| And that was, we bought the team in 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5875)|
| 1:37:58| We bought the land in 2015, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5878)|
| 1:38:02| and started thinking about the possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5882)|
| 1:38:05| of bringing the team here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5885)|
| 1:38:07| Now, if it doesn't work out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5887)|
| 1:38:09| we'll, to Councilwoman Parker's question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5889)|
| 1:38:14| we'll find another use and put it to good use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5894)|
| 1:38:16| But the idea of bringing baseball to downtown Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5896)|
| 1:38:20| a community event center to downtown Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5900)|
| 1:38:24| is something that I think would not only be great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5904)|
| 1:38:27| for sports fans, but be great for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5907)|
| 1:38:30| And I look around at other cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5910)|
| 1:38:32| when I was commissioner of economic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5912)|
| 1:38:33| and community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5913)|
| 1:38:34| Nashville has all these sports stadiums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5914)|
| 1:38:36| and Memphis did, and even Chattanooga did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5916)|
| 1:38:39| And my hometown didn't have anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5919)|
| 1:38:41| And I'll just maybe make on, finally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5921)|
| 1:38:43| on one other point that is while I'm kind of addressing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5923)|
| 1:38:47| Now, I used to be the commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5927)|
| 1:38:47| of economic and community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5927)|
| 1:38:50| You're trying to direct businesses to communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5930)|
| 1:38:54| The number one thing that businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5934)|
| 1:38:55| are looking for is talent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5935)|
| 1:38:57| And here's the thing I found.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5937)|
| 1:38:59| There's no unemployed, highly skilled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5939)|
| 1:39:01| or there's not highly skilled talent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5941)|
| 1:39:03| in any community that's unemployed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5943)|
| 1:39:05| Businesses aren't gonna be able to move someplace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5945)|
| 1:39:07| and say, oh, there's a lot of really skilled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5947)|
| 1:39:08| unemployed people here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5948)|
| 1:39:09| That just doesn't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5949)|
| 1:39:11| What businesses do is they move to a place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5951)|
| 1:39:13| where they think they can attract the talent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5953)|
| 1:39:14| So the things that we can do to make our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5954)|
| 1:39:17| more attractive to people, to talent to come to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5957)|
| 1:39:20| the stronger our community will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5960)|
| 1:39:21| And I think this project can help do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5961)|
| 1:39:25| Thank you very much, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5965)|
| 1:39:27| Thank you, Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5967)|
| 1:39:28| I'll go back to Council Member Parker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5968)|
| 1:39:31| and then I'll call on Council Member Roberto after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5971)|
| 1:39:38| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5978)|
| 1:39:41| There was discussion of a public amenity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5981)|
| 1:39:46| I heard mention of it being open during the day for walking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5986)|
| 1:39:52| Is that the extent of this space as a public amenity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5992)|
| 1:39:59| Maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5999)|
| 1:40:00| I'll just answer and just say that no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6000)|
| 1:40:01| that was just an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6001)|
| 1:40:03| But we will be having lots of open dialogue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6003)|
| 1:40:05| with the community about many ways in which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6005)|
| 1:40:07| we can involve the community in a lot of ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6007)|
| 1:40:11| including youth baseball and bringing Magnet Academy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6011)|
| 1:40:14| and Biomagnet Academy to having more events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6014)|
| 1:40:18| And we were just beginning those brainstorming sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6018)|
| 1:40:21| But no, that was just meant as an example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6021)|
| 1:40:22| certainly not the extent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6022)|
| 1:40:24| One comment I wanted to make is we have properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6024)|
| 1:40:29| like this in our community that are locked up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6029)|
| 1:40:32| until you have enough money to rent it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6032)|
| 1:40:36| for an event or a sports activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6036)|
| 1:40:38| And too often, the folks, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6038)|
| 1:40:41| living at Austin Homes are not the ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6041)|
| 1:40:44| who are able to afford to rent out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6044)|
| 1:40:46| an entire stadium in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6046)|
| 1:40:49| We had this experience before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6049)|
| 1:40:52| when the Civic Coliseum was built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6052)|
| 1:40:54| And when that part of our community was destroyed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6054)|
| 1:40:59| so that that Coliseum could be built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6059)|
| 1:41:01| there were promises made to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6061)|
| 1:41:03| that they would be able to use this as a public amenity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6063)|
| 1:41:07| That was true in the early years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6067)|
| 1:41:10| but then it became less affordable for the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6070)|
| 1:41:13| and less accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6073)|
| 1:41:16| Similar arguments were made for the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6076)|
| 1:41:19| I've run multiple nonprofits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6079)|
| 1:41:22| I have never run a nonprofit that was able to afford| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6082)|
| 1:41:25| the convention center for an event space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6085)|
| 1:41:28| So I just wanted to put this in perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6088)|
| 1:41:31| you know, that when we say public amenity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6091)|
| 1:41:35| are we including all of the public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6095)|
| 1:41:38| Are we talking about free public space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6098)|
| 1:41:40| free use of this space?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6100)|
| 1:41:44| Go ahead, Stephanie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6104)|
| 1:41:45| Oh, yeah, thanks, Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6105)|
| 1:41:47| A great question, and I'm gonna be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6107)|
| 1:41:50| I was skeptical about the exact same thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6110)|
| 1:41:52| because I'm not as familiar with the modern stadium design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6112)|
| 1:41:57| I was able to visit the stadium in Fort Wayne| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6117)|
| 1:42:01| and was honestly just really pleasantly surprised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6121)|
| 1:42:07| at the number of people just from the general public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6127)|
| 1:42:11| who were utilizing the stadium space for a walking track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6131)|
| 1:42:16| was the thing that I noticed for sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6136)|
| 1:42:18| with people with strollers out of the rain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6138)|
| 1:42:22| that was a really good attribute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6142)|
| 1:42:24| But people who are picnicking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6144)|
| 1:42:26| people were having little small group meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6146)|
| 1:42:28| because, you know, this is COVID time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6148)|
| 1:42:30| So for people who don't wanna meet indoors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6150)|
| 1:42:34| there are seats, they were sitting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6154)|
| 1:42:36| They weren't paying to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6156)|
| 1:42:38| They might have paid for the food that they bought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6158)|
| 1:42:40| at the farmer's market, which was happening right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6160)|
| 1:42:45| But then they went and sat down the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6165)|
| 1:42:48| I had many, many questions just like the one that you had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6168)|
| 1:42:52| and was very pleasantly surprised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6172)|
| 1:42:56| to see and hear and talk to people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6176)|
| 1:42:57| who were using the stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6177)|
| 1:42:58| about how much they were able to enjoy it during their lunch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6178)|
| 1:43:02| or for their kid's birthday party| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6182)|
| 1:43:04| without having to pay to utilize the concourse space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6184)|
| 1:43:08| Obviously there are boxes, there are indoor spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6188)|
| 1:43:12| that might be treated a little bit differently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6192)|
| 1:43:14| but the stadium overall was just a really great open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6194)|
| 1:43:20| And I'll ask you this since we're talking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6200)|
| 1:43:24| but did you get a sense in Fort Wayne| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6204)|
| 1:43:26| of how close by in that city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6206)|
| 1:43:30| their services for the homeless community are to the stadium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6210)|
| 1:43:35| Another great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6215)|
| 1:43:36| And not only did we get a sense of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6216)|
| 1:43:39| but we were able to walk the entire downtown area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6219)|
| 1:43:43| and we actually were able to see the facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6223)|
| 1:43:47| and the service providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6227)|
| 1:43:49| who were serving unsheltered homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6229)|
| 1:43:52| and other homeless community members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6232)|
| 1:43:55| So it's an urban environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6235)|
| 1:44:00| So very, very similar in many ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6240)|
| 1:44:03| to what you would see in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6243)|
| 1:44:07| If I could interrupt again quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6247)|
| 1:44:10| just to call on Andrew Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6250)|
| 1:44:12| I wanna be conscious of our time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6252)|
| 1:44:14| and also see if there's any other questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6254)|
| 1:44:17| that any of the other members have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6257)|
| 1:44:19| as we approach close to our two-hour mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6259)|
| 1:44:22| Certainly, Donna.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6262)|
| 1:44:23| Are we stopping at two-hour mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6263)|
| 1:44:26| Because that wasn't clear to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6266)|
| 1:44:27| I mean, we don't have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6267)|
| 1:44:29| but I wanna give everybody an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6269)|
| 1:44:31| to answer questions as we ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6271)|
| 1:44:33| I have a lot more questions and this is a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6273)|
| 1:44:35| This is when we ask our questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6275)|
| 1:44:38| Okay, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6278)|
| 1:44:39| I just wanna give everybody an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6279)|
| 1:44:41| And I also think there's also opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6281)|
| 1:44:43| for people to have off-site and more detailed meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6283)|
| 1:44:46| This is for the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6286)|
| 1:44:48| My questions and the answers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6288)|
| 1:44:50| are for the public's consumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6290)|
| 1:44:52| I don't care to ask private questions of anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6292)|
| 1:44:57| I'm not suggesting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6297)|
| 1:44:58| I'm just trying to give everybody an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6298)|
| 1:45:00| to answer, ask questions across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6300)|
| 1:45:04| So if you have more questions, just keep your hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6304)|
| 1:45:07| But I would like to ask Council Member Roberto| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6307)|
| 1:45:09| to ask his question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6309)|
| 1:45:11| He's asked to circle back around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6311)|
| 1:45:15| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6315)|
| 1:45:18| My question is for Mr. Manitow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6318)|
| 1:45:21| You, in your presentation, you had a slide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6321)|
| 1:45:23| where you were going through a lot of different communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6323)|
| 1:45:27| where they had similar projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6327)|
| 1:45:29| but we don't have to actually look very far, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6329)|
| 1:45:33| for something that's a little bit different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6333)|
| 1:45:35| but similar here in our own community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6335)|
| 1:45:38| So what I was curious about is how is the stadium proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6338)|
| 1:45:42| similar and or different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6342)|
| 1:45:44| with respect to the convention center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6344)|
| 1:45:46| and our experience with that project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6346)|
| 1:45:51| It's funny, the stadium project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6351)|
| 1:45:52| has brought back a lot of memories for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6352)|
| 1:45:54| because of some of the parallels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6354)|
| 1:45:56| and some of the differences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6356)|
| 1:45:59| In the convention centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6359)|
| 1:46:01| some of you with gray hair like me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6361)|
| 1:46:03| remember that in many ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6363)|
| 1:46:05| it was a product of an inability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6365)|
| 1:46:07| to keep the baseball stadium here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6367)|
| 1:46:09| that we were looking for downtown development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6369)|
| 1:46:12| and the county and the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6372)|
| 1:46:14| while getting along fairly well at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6374)|
| 1:46:16| didn't really coordinate their efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6376)|
| 1:46:18| to keep the baseball team here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6378)|
| 1:46:20| as well as they may have could have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6380)|
| 1:46:24| But they both made a valiant effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6384)|
| 1:46:27| and it just didn't work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6387)|
| 1:46:29| They had an out-of-town owner of the team at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6389)|
| 1:46:31| and he picked the best deal up in Sevierville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6391)|
| 1:46:33| And so we turned to the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6393)|
| 1:46:36| Now, the convention center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6396)|
| 1:46:38| the big parallel between the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6398)|
| 1:46:40| is the sales tax legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6400)|
| 1:46:42| that we've talked to you guys about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6402)|
| 1:46:44| That legislation, at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6404)|
| 1:46:47| we were trying to figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6407)|
| 1:46:48| how are we gonna help pay for the convention center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6408)|
| 1:46:51| Keep in mind, the convention center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6411)|
| 1:46:52| is $160 million financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6412)|
| 1:46:55| You're talking, in today's dollar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6415)|
| 1:46:57| well over $200 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6417)|
| 1:46:59| You're talking a project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6419)|
| 1:47:00| that's three times the size of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6420)|
| 1:47:02| that the city alone took on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6422)|
| 1:47:04| and it's still well over two-thirds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6424)|
| 1:47:06| probably the city's debt surface to this day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6426)|
| 1:47:09| But we, at the time, wrote a legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6429)|
| 1:47:13| that people know as the TDZ legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6433)|
| 1:47:15| that has now been widely used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6435)|
| 1:47:16| by every other major city in the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6436)|
| 1:47:18| to help pay for that convention center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6438)|
| 1:47:20| which is basically we're capturing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6440)|
| 1:47:22| the incremental sales tax from our downtown growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6442)|
| 1:47:26| the state's portion of that to help pay for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6446)|
| 1:47:28| That's essentially what we're proposing here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6448)|
| 1:47:30| but on a much smaller scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6450)|
| 1:47:32| a quarter of a mile versus the CBID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6452)|
| 1:47:35| So we wrote that TDZ legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6455)|
| 1:47:37| And you know what we estimated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6457)|
| 1:47:39| Basically a million five at a good day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6459)|
| 1:47:42| of incremental sales tax revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6462)|
| 1:47:44| And Randy's gonna love this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6464)|
| 1:47:45| It's well over $8 million a year until the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6465)|
| 1:47:49| And really the pandemic has not hurt it very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6469)|
| 1:47:51| We way underestimated in retrospect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6471)|
| 1:47:54| how much money the TDZ would produce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6474)|
| 1:47:56| to help pay for the convention center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6476)|
| 1:47:58| which is really a great thing for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6478)|
| 1:48:01| And it's now paying probably 80 to 90%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6481)|
| 1:48:04| of the debt surface for the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6484)|
| 1:48:06| along with hotel motel taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6486)|
| 1:48:08| that the county agreed to contribute at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6488)|
| 1:48:12| at a level of a million five a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6492)|
| 1:48:14| And so there is that parallel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6494)|
| 1:48:17| in terms of the sales tax revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6497)|
| 1:48:19| And there's also the parallel that this was a public asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6499)|
| 1:48:23| Ironically, the convention center in many ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6503)|
| 1:48:26| is a public asset for tourists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6506)|
| 1:48:28| I mean, we do, most of you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6508)|
| 1:48:29| I'm sure all of you all have probably been to events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6509)|
| 1:48:31| at the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6511)|
| 1:48:32| I've been there many times with my kids for things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6512)|
| 1:48:34| I'm sure you all have as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6514)|
| 1:48:35| but the convention center wasn't designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6515)|
| 1:48:38| to attract people to our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6518)|
| 1:48:39| from all over the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6519)|
| 1:48:40| It really wasn't designed to be a primarily local thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6520)|
| 1:48:43| The stadium we hope obviously will be a much more locally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6523)|
| 1:48:46| and regionally focused asset than the convention center is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6526)|
| 1:48:49| And it's managed by a third party| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6529)|
| 1:48:51| and never was expected to make a profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6531)|
| 1:48:54| The whole idea and it never has made a profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6534)|
| 1:48:56| We lose money on the convention center every single year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6536)|
| 1:48:58| from an operational standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6538)|
| 1:49:00| but hopefully make up for that in the sales tax revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6540)|
| 1:49:03| and the like that are generated from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6543)|
| 1:49:05| So those are the similarities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6545)|
| 1:49:07| but the differences are obviously the size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6547)|
| 1:49:09| which I mentioned, it's very different in that respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6549)|
| 1:49:13| And the convention center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6553)|
| 1:49:18| we didn't have the dedicated sources of revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6558)|
| 1:49:20| The TDZ was a sort of a hope and a dream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6560)|
| 1:49:23| and we didn't know what it would produce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6563)|
| 1:49:24| In fact, it didn't really start producing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6564)|
| 1:49:26| until downtown took off about five years later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6566)|
| 1:49:29| And we never fully started realizing the benefits of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6569)|
| 1:49:31| for eight or nine years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6571)|
| 1:49:33| Here we have Randy and his team willing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6573)|
| 1:49:35| to do $140 million of development out of the box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6575)|
| 1:49:37| We had nothing like that with the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6577)|
| 1:49:40| As you all know, there's nothing to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6580)|
| 1:49:42| on that side of Henley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6582)|
| 1:49:43| We made the entire thing into World's Fair Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6583)|
| 1:49:44| which is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6584)|
| 1:49:45| It's a beautiful park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6585)|
| 1:49:46| but there's no effectively adjacent development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6586)|
| 1:49:48| other than the hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6588)|
| 1:49:50| So we didn't really get the benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6590)|
| 1:49:51| of a dedicated investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6591)|
| 1:49:55| Sorry, I was sort of looking at my notes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6595)|
| 1:49:56| because I thought somebody might ask me about the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6596)|
| 1:49:59| And so, it's a very different deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6599)|
| 1:50:03| I mean, in terms of the risk scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6603)|
| 1:50:05| that we took on the convention center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6605)|
| 1:50:06| versus what we're talking about here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6606)|
| 1:50:08| the convention center in terms of likely exposure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6608)|
| 1:50:10| to the city was probably an eight or nine or a 10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6610)|
| 1:50:13| maybe even in terms of having to contribute funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6613)|
| 1:50:16| while this one is probably more like a two or a three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6616)|
| 1:50:19| So there's huge differences between the risk taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6619)|
| 1:50:21| at the convention center at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6621)|
| 1:50:23| versus what you're being asked to consider today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6623)|
| 1:50:25| And I think most of us hopefully would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6625)|
| 1:50:28| well, the convention center may be too big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6628)|
| 1:50:30| on what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6630)|
| 1:50:31| And you can certainly can make a lot of arguments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6631)|
| 1:50:32| but ultimately it's been a public asset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6632)|
| 1:50:33| that largely will pay for itself through the TDZ revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6633)|
| 1:50:37| and the additional hotel motel tax revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6637)|
| 1:50:39| from visitors to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6639)|
| 1:50:43| Thank you, appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6643)|

| 1:50:46| Councilwoman Riders, I'll give you a second shot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6646)|
| 1:50:49| before I move back to the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6649)|
| 1:50:55| Unmute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6655)|
| 1:50:58| Mr. Boyd, this may be too early to ask this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6658)|
| 1:51:01| but I think it's important to talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6661)|
| 1:51:03| you mentioned you've been having conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6663)|
| 1:51:06| with Vine and Sarah Moore Green there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6666)|
| 1:51:11| And I'm hoping Austin East as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6671)|
| 1:51:15| My kids go to Vine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6675)|
| 1:51:16| so we have familiarity with the school there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6676)|
| 1:51:20| And I think it's really important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6680)|
| 1:51:22| and the location that you're proposing here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6682)|
| 1:51:25| we're really tying well with those schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6685)|
| 1:51:28| What kinds of conversations are you having?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6688)|
| 1:51:29| Oh, and then let me make the plug also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6689)|
| 1:51:31| that Pellissippi State's Magnolia campus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6691)|
| 1:51:33| is around the corner as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6693)|
| 1:51:36| So I'm curious what those conversations are looking like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6696)|
| 1:51:38| where are they going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6698)|
| 1:51:40| They probably know a little bit about my background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6700)|
| 1:51:41| So I've been a very big partner with Anthony Wise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6701)|
| 1:51:43| and in Pellissippi for a long, long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6703)|
| 1:51:47| So my teammates actually had the meetings at Vine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6707)|
| 1:51:49| and to get to make that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6709)|
| 1:51:50| And they also had one at Green Magnet Academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6710)|
| 1:51:52| but I went back again with the Knox Education Foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6712)|
| 1:51:55| just a couple of weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6715)|
| 1:51:57| We're just having a beginning conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6717)|
| 1:51:59| There's a lot of things that I think that we can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6719)|
| 1:52:02| from a youth sports involvement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6722)|
| 1:52:05| from when you get to Austin East,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6725)|
| 1:52:07| the opportunities to have internships and apprenticeships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6727)|
| 1:52:11| so they can have summer jobs and evening jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6731)|
| 1:52:13| So I think there's a whole host of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6733)|
| 1:52:16| that I think we can do in that realm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6736)|
| 1:52:18| I'll just say very specifically a current project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6738)|
| 1:52:22| And again, these things aren't quid pro quos,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6742)|
| 1:52:25| it's just things we wanna do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6745)|
| 1:52:27| because we care, but we got a chance to tour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6747)|
| 1:52:29| Green Magnet Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6749)|
| 1:52:30| We were aware that they needed some help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6750)|
| 1:52:33| with their playground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6753)|
| 1:52:36| And so our principal there is making us a proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6756)|
| 1:52:38| I asked her to make three proposals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6758)|
| 1:52:40| a great proposal, an even greater proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6760)|
| 1:52:42| and the wildly audacious proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6762)|
| 1:52:44| And so I'm looking forward to getting their proposal back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6764)|
| 1:52:47| and seeing what we can do to help with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6767)|
| 1:52:49| But there's an unlimited amount of opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6769)|
| 1:52:53| to work with each of the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6773)|
| 1:52:54| from developing youth leagues to internships,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6774)|
| 1:52:58| to just private donations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6778)|
| 1:52:59| to help support their infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6779)|
| 1:53:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6782)|
| 1:53:03| By the way, when I was at Green Magnet Academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6783)|
| 1:53:05| you guys probably know this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6785)|
| 1:53:06| but I was struck by this stat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6786)|
| 1:53:10| A gentleman named Olivier that works there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6790)|
| 1:53:13| shared with me that the average income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6793)|
| 1:53:16| in this zip code is $17,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6796)|
| 1:53:21| No matter how great a principal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6801)|
| 1:53:23| how great a teacher you put in front of those kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6803)|
| 1:53:26| when they're coming from a family that is so impoverished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6806)|
| 1:53:29| it's gonna be really difficult for them to be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6809)|
| 1:53:32| They're not gonna have the support they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6812)|
| 1:53:34| What we need most in this area is jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6814)|
| 1:53:37| is economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6817)|
| 1:53:38| And we're hopeful that this is the biggest project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6818)|
| 1:53:41| we've brought to the city of Knoxville in our history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6821)|
| 1:53:43| And to put it in the area that needs it the most,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6823)|
| 1:53:46| it could be transformative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6826)|
| 1:53:47| So we can create a new playground and that's nice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6827)|
| 1:53:52| but if we can give those families jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6832)|
| 1:53:54| that's what's gonna be transformative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6834)|
| 1:53:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6837)|
| 1:53:58| I look forward to hearing how that progresses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6838)|
| 1:54:02| because I think that's really critical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6842)|
| 1:54:04| how those schools are plugged in and how it continues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6844)|
| 1:54:10| So hopefully we'll have a lot more public conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6850)|
| 1:54:13| about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6853)|
| 1:54:15| I'll let somebody else ask him questions for a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6855)|
| 1:54:19| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6859)|

| 1:54:32| I'm a former teacher from Austin East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6872)|
| 1:54:34| and it also goes back to the Rec Sports League| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6874)|
| 1:54:40| you were talking about starting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6880)|
| 1:54:41| Would you be open to maybe creating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6881)|
| 1:54:44| a community benefits agreement to go along with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6884)|
| 1:54:47| just to kind of spell out those parameters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6887)|
| 1:54:50| of what you would be willing to do to help the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6890)|
| 1:54:52| aside from just saying, oh, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6892)|
| 1:54:54| we're gonna do a Rec Baseball League| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6894)|
| 1:54:56| and we're gonna create jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6896)|
| 1:54:58| maybe get a little more into the specifics for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6898)|
| 1:55:01| And just the thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6901)|

| 1:56:18| a really good example came out of Nashville recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6978)|

| 1:56:26| So, you know, what I have a lot of questions about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6986)|
| 1:56:31| are process and timeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6991)|
| 1:56:33| because from what I could see that process and timeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6993)|
| 1:56:37| are moving quite quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6997)|
| 1:56:39| and it kind of gives me heart palpitations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=6999)|
| 1:56:42| to see development agreements would be work on in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7002)|

| 1:57:01| is it does not seem the question is if,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7021)|
| 1:57:06| but how much do we have to pay essentially?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7026)|
| 1:57:11| So my question in terms of process and timeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7031)|
| 1:57:13| and I'll go back to the CBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7033)|

| 1:57:31| or does that just go to the authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7051)|
| 1:57:35| and it does not need to come before council or commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7055)|
| 1:57:39| So councilman Parker, I can start the answer to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7059)|

| 2:00:17| that will include all of the development agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7217)|
| 2:00:22| financing documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7222)|
| 2:00:24| So all of those things are going to be part of the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7224)|
| 2:00:28| that if we need to do additional workshops in the meantime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7228)|
| 2:00:32| we're happy to do that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7232)|
| 2:00:34| So we wanna find the best way to keep everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7234)|
| 2:00:37| in both bodies informed as the process goes along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7237)|
| 2:00:41| and we'll really be looking to Chairman Jay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7241)|
| 2:00:46| and Vice Mayor McKenzie to help make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7246)|
| 2:00:49| that that happens as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7249)|
| 2:00:51| So I'm happy to, if somebody else would like to chime in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7251)|
| 2:00:56| if there's anybody, any other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7256)|
| 2:00:59| So just to clarify, the interlocal agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7259)|
| 2:01:05| would come before us with the development agreements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7265)|
| 2:01:12| I'll let Mr. Maimon talk and answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7272)|
| 2:01:14| Yeah, yes, is the quick answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7274)|
| 2:01:16| I mean, if I were in your shoes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7276)|
| 2:01:19| I definitely would wanna know all insignificant agreements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7279)|
| 2:01:22| in connection with ask to vote on that agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7282)|
| 2:01:24| So by that point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7284)|
| 2:01:27| we would have proposed drafts of all the documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7287)|
| 2:01:30| that we could share with you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7290)|
| 2:01:32| so that you can make an educated decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7292)|
| 2:01:33| whether your vote on the interlocal agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7293)|
| 2:01:36| would be in the best interest of the city or the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7296)|
| 2:01:39| I would also envision that we will have as many workshops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7299)|
| 2:01:42| as each of these bodies would like on each aspect of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7302)|
| 2:01:46| If you would like to have a workshop as a council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7306)|
| 2:01:49| on what the development agreement would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7309)|
| 2:01:51| as the private development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7311)|
| 2:01:53| whether the development agreement is the stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7313)|
| 2:01:56| the lease on the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7316)|
| 2:01:57| I mean, these are, as you're pointing out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7317)|
| 2:02:01| these are complicated documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7321)|
| 2:02:03| that we will welcome opportunities to share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7323)|
| 2:02:09| and to get the input as we go through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7329)|
| 2:02:12| But yes, certainly at that juncture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7332)|
| 2:02:14| you will have the full array of the deal before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7334)|
| 2:02:18| to make an educated decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7338)|
| 2:02:20| whether this is in the best interest of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7340)|
| 2:02:25| And then my final question of the night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7345)|
| 2:02:29| This is, I mean, come on y'all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7349)|
| 2:02:31| we are the government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7351)|
| 2:02:32| This is sad how this is going, a little ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7352)|
| 2:02:36| I would like to talk about the property tax scheme| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7356)|
| 2:02:39| because, and I have a lot of questions just on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7359)|
| 2:02:43| Can we do a workshop just on the financing structure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7363)|
| 2:02:46| I would love that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7366)|
| 2:02:47| Because one thing that I heard mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7367)|
| 2:02:50| was that no property tax can be used on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7370)|
| 2:02:53| And we can't have a tax hike just to pay for the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7373)|
| 2:02:57| But then we heard that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7377)|
| 2:02:59| oh, we might be able to use pilots and TIFs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7379)|
| 2:03:02| and get around that whole no use and property tax issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7382)|
| 2:03:05| And then when we look at using the sales tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7385)|
| 2:03:13| from the stadium, sales tax from the local area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7393)|
| 2:03:19| there was something else from it, the TIFs program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7399)|
| 2:03:23| What I'm trying to see is at what point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7403)|
| 2:03:28| well, a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7408)|
| 2:03:29| At what point would we realize any tax gains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7409)|
| 2:03:33| off of this stadium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7413)|
| 2:03:35| And of course we can speculate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7415)|
| 2:03:36| oh, it's gonna bring so many people to town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7416)|
| 2:03:37| it's gonna create all this other tax revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7417)|
| 2:03:40| throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7420)|
| 2:03:42| Report after report after report I've read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7422)|
| 2:03:44| have shown that that does not happen in other cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7424)|
| 2:03:47| where these stadiums have been built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7427)|
| 2:03:51| Are we also accounting for if the state passes this new law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7431)|
| 2:03:57| and the taxes are able to be captured,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7437)|
| 2:04:00| how this would impact our local budgets?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7440)|
| 2:04:03| How this would impact that share of sales tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7443)|
| 2:04:06| that would go towards education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7446)|
| 2:04:08| that desperately needs funding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7448)|
| 2:04:11| How long would local taxes be dedicated to this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7451)|
| 2:04:16| Would it be for the next 30 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7456)|
| 2:04:20| These are my concerns and that's what I do not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7460)|
| 2:04:23| a lot of clarity around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7463)|
| 2:04:27| I can answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7467)|
| 2:04:28| I can address that in that we can definitely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7468)|
| 2:04:32| have dedicated workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7472)|
| 2:04:34| We've already discussed different workshops we would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7474)|
| 2:04:37| and there would certainly be one on the nuts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7477)|
| 2:04:40| and the bolts of the financing in a much more detailed way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7480)|
| 2:04:43| Tonight was again, just a starting point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7483)|
| 2:04:45| but we will definitely have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7485)|
| 2:04:48| And everybody is prepared to have as many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7488)|
| 2:04:50| of those workshops as is necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7490)|
| 2:04:52| to provide the information in a public way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7492)|
| 2:04:54| So, I'm going to-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7494)|
| 2:04:56| I have to say a final thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7496)|
| 2:04:58| Let me apologize if my energy has not been what was expected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7498)|
| 2:05:03| but when we had this issue come before city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7503)|
| 2:05:07| we were promised that if the sports authority was formed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7507)|
| 2:05:11| had to form the sports authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7511)|
| 2:05:13| so that you could bring us a proposal forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7513)|
| 2:05:16| And so I thought we were gonna see a proposal today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7516)|
| 2:05:19| Information we heard today is essentially what we heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7519)|
| 2:05:22| at the city council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7522)|
| 2:05:24| So, that's my frustration tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7524)|
| 2:05:27| Thank you all for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7527)|

| 2:05:35| and then I will let council member or vice mayor Mackenzie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7535)|
| 2:05:40| wrap us up for tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7540)|

| 2:05:44| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7544)|

| 2:05:47| We had trouble getting together when you first started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7547)|
| 2:05:50| this project and we kept missing and missing and missing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7550)|
| 2:05:54| and finally we got together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7554)|
| 2:05:56| And what excited me was your excitement for the vision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7556)|
| 2:05:59| of the future of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7559)|
| 2:06:02| And you stepped forward and gave an idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7562)|
| 2:06:05| of what you could do to better the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7565)|
| 2:06:08| And I wanna thank you for that time and that effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7568)|
| 2:06:10| that you gave to me to talk to you personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7570)|
| 2:06:13| And I could just feel that energy around you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7573)|
| 2:06:16| and I can't thank you enough for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7576)|
| 2:06:20| Then that's my comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7580)|
| 2:06:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7582)|

| 2:06:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7585)|
| 2:06:26| Council member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7586)|
| 2:06:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7589)|
| 2:06:29| So, Commissioner Jay, do you anticipate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7589)|
| 2:06:31| that we'll have several more workshops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7591)|
| 2:06:33| because obviously there's a lot of things in play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7593)|
| 2:06:37| and a lot of details that aren't ironed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7597)|
| 2:06:39| So, even if we ask some questions tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7599)|
| 2:06:41| there aren't answers to them, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7601)|
| 2:06:44| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7604)|
| 2:06:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7606)|
| 2:06:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7606)|
| 2:06:47| From my meeting with Mr. Caldwell, Mr. Mametoff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7607)|
| 2:06:50| and Ms. Welch, I hope I got all those names correctly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7610)|
| 2:06:54| for the Ninja Turtle group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7614)|
| 2:06:59| You guys talked about potentially the sports authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7619)|
| 2:07:03| which we still have to appoint members to the next,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7623)|
| 2:07:07| but there's a lot of questions in the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7627)|
| 2:07:08| about next steps and timeframes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7628)|
| 2:07:11| That is potentially not gonna be discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7631)|
| 2:07:13| at the state level until April or later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7633)|
| 2:07:17| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7637)|
| 2:07:19| Mr. Caldwell, did you have a-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7639)|
| 2:07:21| Yeah, I can probably answer that question the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7641)|
| 2:07:25| Council member Ryder, the legislative process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7645)|
| 2:07:29| can be somewhat of a mystery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7649)|
| 2:07:30| It goes through a committee system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7650)|
| 2:07:32| Usually a typical year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7652)|
| 2:07:34| you would hit the committee system in late March,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7654)|
| 2:07:36| early April at the latest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7656)|
| 2:07:38| and then a final vote hopefully by the end of April| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7658)|
| 2:07:40| in the legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7660)|
| 2:07:41| So, I think a realistic timeframe is what you just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7661)|
| 2:07:44| but it could be faster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7664)|
| 2:07:46| I've seen bills get out of the legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7666)|
| 2:07:48| if they've got widespread support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7668)|
| 2:07:50| as early as late February, early March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7670)|
| 2:07:52| So, it could be earlier, but it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7672)|
| 2:07:54| It's, in my judgment, given this fairly significant bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7674)|
| 2:07:59| And I think it may somewhat depend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7679)|
| 2:08:00| on whether Chattanooga joins in with us or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7680)|
| 2:08:02| because I'm sure their legislative delegation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7682)|
| 2:08:04| will be very active as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7684)|
| 2:08:05| And so, I think we will obviously keep you all updated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7685)|
| 2:08:09| for every step of the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7689)|
| 2:08:11| as we go through the committee process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7691)|
| 2:08:14| So, once we have some, we know where that's gonna land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7694)|
| 2:08:20| then we can have a workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7700)|
| 2:08:21| and really dig into how the financial structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7701)|
| 2:08:27| Is it a fair thing to say from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7707)|
| 2:08:29| I remember from what you had up on the screen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7709)|
| 2:08:31| that a significant portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7711)|
| 2:08:34| is going to come from different sales tax revenues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7714)|
| 2:08:37| but then also the team is going to pay a chunk of the debt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7717)|
| 2:08:42| Yeah, their rent would pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7722)|
| 2:08:43| a significant portion of the debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7723)|
| 2:08:45| And so, yes, is the answer to your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7725)|
| 2:08:48| And so, yes, it'll come from revenue sources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7728)|
| 2:08:50| but one of those significant revenue sources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7730)|
| 2:08:52| would be rent payable by the team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7732)|
| 2:08:55| which is something obviously we will negotiate hard on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7735)|
| 2:08:59| and try to maximize the rent for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7739)|
| 2:09:04| Okay, I think what's important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7744)|
| 2:09:06| and I'll close myself up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7746)|
| 2:09:07| because I think there's a lot more to be ironed out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7747)|
| 2:09:10| before we have more and more discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7750)|
| 2:09:15| This is, I think, not a done deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7755)|
| 2:09:17| It's a proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7757)|
| 2:09:18| and there's a lot of negotiations going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7758)|
| 2:09:21| and there's a lot of things to be ironed out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7761)|
| 2:09:22| even at the state ledge perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7762)|
| 2:09:25| I think from my time here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7765)|
| 2:09:28| I've heard a lot of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7768)|
| 2:09:30| why don't people invest in East Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7770)|
| 2:09:32| Why isn't this happening here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7772)|
| 2:09:33| Why doesn't someone do something here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7773)|
| 2:09:35| This is a something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7775)|
| 2:09:37| It's a private public partnership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7777)|
| 2:09:39| and we're going to dig through this, flesh it out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7779)|
| 2:09:42| and ask a lot of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7782)|
| 2:09:43| to decide if this is a good deal for Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7783)|
| 2:09:46| and a good opportunity for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7786)|
| 2:09:48| and I will close my statements up by saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7788)|
| 2:09:52| I'm not from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7792)|
| 2:09:53| I think most people know that I'm not from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7793)|
| 2:09:56| Came here from Georgia by way of Indiana,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7796)|
| 2:10:00| and we had the choice of living at different places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7800)|
| 2:10:04| because my husband was being recruited for work other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7804)|
| 2:10:09| We were looking at houses in Johnson City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7809)|
| 2:10:12| and we made the choice to come to Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7812)|
| 2:10:14| over Johnson City and over Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7814)|
| 2:10:16| for a variety of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7816)|
| 2:10:18| People do make the choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7818)|
| 2:10:19| Do they want to live here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7819)|
| 2:10:21| Is this the community that they want to be here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7821)|
| 2:10:23| Is Knoxville going to be able to attract people to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7823)|
| 2:10:26| Is this part of the fabric to attract people here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7826)|
| 2:10:31| Knoxville had more amenities and more opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7831)|
| 2:10:34| and it was just a better fit for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7834)|
| 2:10:37| but I will say having been on the recruiting people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7837)|
| 2:10:41| into the medical community and physicians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7841)|
| 2:10:43| that is a challenge that Knoxville has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=7843)|
