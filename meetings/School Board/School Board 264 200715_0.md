| 0:15:54| We have a diversity development manager in the county that should be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| help with the good leads with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=957)|
| 0:15:59| And then lastly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=959)|
| 0:16:00| be transparent about the process and the deadline so that all stakeholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=960)|
| 0:16:03| could have the opportunity to participate in receiving the economic benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=963)|
| 0:16:09| A lot went into the efforts to get us here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=969)|
| 0:16:12| and I just want to make sure that the construction company understands the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=972)|
| 0:16:15| importance of being intentional about the impact you will have in Lonsdale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=975)|
| 0:16:19| and continue to work with that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=979)|

| 0:16:30| or to keep the board aware of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=990)|
| 0:16:33| I hope that they will be informed on the design plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=993)|
| 0:16:38| There's a lot of interesting things about that site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=998)|
| 0:16:42| and certainly many things that could be beneficial to the kids over there for long haul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1002)|
| 0:16:47| So just keep your eyes open and be alert for those plans as they come available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1007)|

| 0:19:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1141)|
| 0:19:02| And the next item...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1142)|
| 0:19:03| Thank you, Ms. Coatney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1143)|
| 0:19:04| The next item is the presentation of the reopening plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1144)|
| 0:19:09| And as we move into this item, I'd like to just provide a little bit of background on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1149)|
| 0:19:13| the decision that it appears on today's agenda as a presentation and not an item for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1153)|
| 0:19:20| board to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1160)|
| 0:19:21| The superintendent and the board chair comprise the executive committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1161)|
| 0:19:25| When we met in June to set today's agenda, the superintendent and I determined that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1165)|
| 0:19:30| best course of action was for the board not to approve the reopening plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1170)|
| 0:19:35| The reason for that was to be sure we did not get into a situation that would make it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1175)|
| 0:19:40| difficult for the superintendent to make alterations should conditions change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1180)|
| 0:19:45| Board policy A-141 gives the superintendent the ability to cancel schools as needed in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1185)|
| 0:19:51| emergency situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| Granted, this is a reopening plan and not an emergency, but the reasoning is quite similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1193)|
| 0:19:58| Board members do not weigh in on cancellations due to sickness or weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1198)|
| 0:20:02| It is not recommended that boards micromanage their superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1202)|
| 0:20:06| Such tasks are delegated to the superintendent in board policy C-120.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1206)|
| 0:20:11| It states, in part, the director of schools shall be the chief executive officer of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1211)|
| 0:20:17| school system and shall have, under the direction of the board, general supervision of all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1217)|
| 0:20:22| public schools, personnel, and departments of the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1222)|
| 0:20:27| The director of schools is responsible for the management of the schools under the board's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1227)|
| 0:20:31| policies and is accountable to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1231)|
| 0:20:34| Earlier this week, TSBA, the Tennessee School Board Association, released guidance indicating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1234)|
| 0:20:39| that boards should vote on reopening plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1239)|
| 0:20:42| Deputy Law Director Gary Dupler and I discussed this and decided that the decision made in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1242)|
| 0:20:47| June by our executive committee is still appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1247)|
| 0:20:51| Policy C-120 goes on to state that the director of schools is responsible for implementing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1251)|
| 0:20:57| board policies and for interpreting them to the staff, students, and the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1257)|
| 0:21:03| The director of schools, in consultation with principals, staff members, and other persons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1263)|
| 0:21:08| and groups as topically appropriate, shall develop administrative rules and procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1268)|
| 0:21:14| as necessary to implement board policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1274)|
| 0:21:18| In my view, Mr. Thomas has done this extensively and is planning to present a reopening plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1278)|
| 0:21:23| this evening, at which time board members will have the opportunity to make comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1283)|
| 0:21:27| ask questions, or discuss changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1287)|
| 0:21:30| As with any issue we discuss, board members may make a motion, and with a second, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1290)|
| 0:21:34| motion would be discussed and voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1294)|
| 0:21:37| I think it's unfortunate and irresponsible that anyone would put into the public arena| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1297)|
| 0:21:42| that this board could not vote on an item relative to the school system we govern if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1302)|
| 0:21:47| we so choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1307)|
| 0:21:49| There is absolutely no truth in that notion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1309)|
| 0:21:54| The plan being presented inherently allows for flexibility as needed to the superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1314)|
| 0:22:00| as needed, so the superintendent would likely have the latitude to make changes as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1320)|
| 0:22:05| However, I feel the board policies I've stated implicitly state implicitly why I did not feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1325)|
| 0:22:11| that we must vote on this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1331)|
| 0:22:13| By presenting this plan, the superintendent is carrying out the expectations of this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1333)|
| 0:22:18| as cited in policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1338)|
| 0:22:20| And so that's, I just wanted to give everybody the reasoning behind the thoughtful decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1340)|
| 0:22:25| that we made as a team between the executive committee with guidance from our law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1345)|
| 0:22:33| And so what I would like to do now is I would like to, for this to be just a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1353)|
| 0:22:39| different this evening, I would like to ask Superintendent Thomas to go through the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1359)|
| 0:22:43| Then we have three or four folks signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1363)|
| 0:22:47| I would like to hear from those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| Then I would like to have a board discussion at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1369)|
| 0:22:54| So that is the way I would like to proceed unless anybody has an issue with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1374)|
| 0:23:00| Ms. Owen, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1380)|
| 0:23:02| I have a question for the law director and then I would like to make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1382)|
| 0:23:07| Mr. Dupler, can you tell me what the powers of the executive committee are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1387)|
| 0:23:18| The executive committee is made up of the board chair and the superintendent or director of school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1398)|
| 0:23:27| And it's set out in policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1407)|
| 0:23:31| But their biggest task is to set the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1411)|
| 0:23:38| After that, they have, you know, and I could pull it up and let you know a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1418)|
| 0:23:45| But, I mean, that's their biggest task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1425)|
| 0:23:48| And then after that, they have certain other powers that the board would then ratify if needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1428)|
| 0:23:57| But I can take a look at it and tell you more if we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1442)|
| 0:24:03| If we delegated a power to the executive committee, they would have that power?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1443)|
| 0:24:07| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1447)|
| 0:24:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1448)|
| 0:24:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1449)|
| 0:24:10| So, as a rule of thumb, as a daily management issue, do they have decision-making authority?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1450)|
| 0:24:20| Well, that would depend upon what you call a daily management issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1460)|
| 0:24:27| Really any issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1467)|
| 0:24:30| What decision-making authority do they have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1470)|
| 0:24:34| Well, I think it's more the director of schools or the superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1474)|
| 0:24:39| He's the chief administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1479)|
| 0:24:43| So, I mean, he has that daily management capability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1483)|
| 0:24:47| With that said, you know, it's been said by not only me but my predecessors here who advise the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1487)|
| 0:24:58| is that, you know, the board can weigh in at any time and can change a motion or a policy with five votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1498)|
| 0:25:07| So, you know, the director of schools certainly has that power to maintain business, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1507)|
| 0:25:15| But if the board wants to weigh in, the board can certainly weigh in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1515)|
| 0:25:18| Thank you, Mr. Dickler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1518)|
| 0:25:20| For those folks who came on the board at the same time that I did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1520)|
| 0:25:24| I would like to remind you that we had this conversation at that time during some of our very first meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1524)|
| 0:25:30| The reason we had that conversation is because it was suggested that the way the agenda was being set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1530)|
| 0:25:37| may not be considering everything that should be on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1537)|
| 0:25:41| And at that time, I was told, this was four years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1541)|
| 0:25:45| when we asked for adjustments to the way the agenda is created and maintained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1545)|
| 0:25:50| I was repeatedly told that there is never a time when a board member has been unable to put an item on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1550)|
| 0:26:00| So I'm unclear as to how the executive committee has decision-making authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1560)|
| 0:26:08| that something cannot be on the agenda or that something as weighty as this issue that we have before us would not be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1568)|
| 0:26:19| For several weeks, I have requested over and over that the meetings be noticed, that they be open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1579)|
| 0:26:29| that we be transparent in what we're discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1589)|
| 0:26:33| And over and over, I've been told that it's not necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1593)|
| 0:26:37| Our whole purpose for being here is transparency between the school district and our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1597)|
| 0:26:47| That's what we're supposed to be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1607)|
| 0:26:49| We're supposed to ensure that transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1609)|
| 0:26:52| And when we cannot discuss an item because it's not on the agenda at all and because no one will put it there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1612)|
| 0:27:00| or when it is worded in such a way that it gives the community the impression that we're not going to discuss it, that's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1620)|
| 0:27:11| Central Knoll requires that we be open and transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1631)|
| 0:27:18| And part of that is that our agenda should be clear exactly what is going to be discussed and voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1638)|
| 0:27:26| Until today, this wasn't even listed on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1646)|
| 0:27:30| even though it's been said in public over and over and over that it would be presented today and in this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1650)|
| 0:27:36| So somewhere there's a disconnect between our spoken intent to be open and transparent to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1656)|
| 0:27:48| and our actual willingness to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1668)|
| 0:27:52| So I would like to make a motion that we have discussion after this presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1672)|
| 0:27:58| and that after that discussion, if we would like to have any kind of action, that we be allowed to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1678)|
| 0:28:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1690)|
| 0:28:14| Are you making a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| I would like to make a motion that we have discussion with possible action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1696)|
| 0:28:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1702)|
| 0:28:25| I second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1705)|
| 0:28:27| I second your motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1709)|
| 0:28:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1712)|
| 0:28:33| Are you agreeable to the timeline I laid out, to hear from public forum after the presentation, before our discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1713)|
| 0:28:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1719)|
| 0:28:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1720)|
| 0:28:41| So all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1721)|
| 0:28:43| Wait, one moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1723)|
| 0:28:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1724)|
| 0:28:45| I'm sorry, Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1725)|
| 0:28:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1726)|
| 0:28:47| What I don't understand is the chair has presented the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1727)|
| 0:28:56| It's the chair and the executive committee's position that we don't need to vote on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1736)|
| 0:29:06| and it's actually advantageous to the system, to the superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1746)|
| 0:29:13| to the people involved in making these decisions for us not to be voting on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1753)|
| 0:29:20| It's their composition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1760)|
| 0:29:26| They've been in control of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| There has been public meetings all over the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1768)|
| 0:29:32| There's been discussion all over the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| I don't know where this lack of transparency stuff comes from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1774)|
| 0:29:38| So I don't see the need for that, and I won't support this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1778)|
| 0:29:44| Thank you, Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1784)|
| 0:29:48| Ms. Owen, did you have something to say before I make a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1788)|
| 0:29:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1791)|
| 0:29:52| I would like to point out that the only advantage to not voting on this issue is a political advantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1792)|
| 0:29:59| There are multiple policies that we have adopted, that we have voted on right here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1799)|
| 0:30:05| that very specifically lay out how the administration can change those as they go along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1805)|
| 0:30:13| Our discipline policy is a fine example that decisions can be made within that policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1813)|
| 0:30:20| and principals can make adjustments as they need to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1820)|
| 0:30:24| administration can make adjustments as they need to, because we put that language in the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1824)|
| 0:30:30| So there's no reason we couldn't do that same thing with this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1830)|
| 0:30:35| We could make a motion that allows adjustments as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1835)|
| 0:30:40| Can you restate what your motion was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1840)|
| 0:30:42| Because I think I'm thinking about two different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1842)|
| 0:30:44| It's to have a discussion and possible action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1844)|
| 0:30:47| Which, I mean, that was on the plan anyway, so I think hopefully we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1847)|
| 0:30:52| All we had was that we were going to have a presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1852)|
| 0:30:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1856)|
| 0:30:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1857)|
| 0:30:58| In my statement, I said we would have time for questions and comments, and so it was. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1858)|
| 0:31:02| And it's just like anything that is ever on our agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1862)|
| 0:31:05| this board always has the prerogative to ask questions, comments, and to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1865)|
| 0:31:10| So it just isn't needed, because our way of doing business, our practical way of doing business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1870)|
| 0:31:18| even if something is not stated clearly on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1878)|
| 0:31:22| is that this board can always make a motion and we can always discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1882)|
| 0:31:25| We can, but when it's not stated clearly on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| it's not clear to the public that anything could be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1888)|
| 0:31:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1891)|
| 0:31:32| And so we wouldn't be having email after email asking when we're going to vote on something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1892)|
| 0:31:41| that we're very clearly not going to vote on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1901)|
| 0:31:44| or when we're going to have discussion about something that's not even on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1904)|
| 0:31:50| We wouldn't be having those emails if it were clear on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1910)|
| 0:31:54| And that goes all the way back to everything that the task force has said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1914)|
| 0:31:58| which were the only two meetings that were public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1918)|
| 0:32:02| And over and over they said communication is extremely necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1922)|
| 0:32:07| and communication is what we just do not have with our constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1927)|
| 0:32:13| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1933)|
| 0:32:14| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1934)|
| 0:32:15| Mine is, I guess, a procedural question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1935)|
| 0:32:22| Would it not be better under the circumstances to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1942)|
| 0:32:28| everybody agrees that we're going to listen to public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1948)|
| 0:32:34| and then after that, would that not be the point that Ms. Owens should make her motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1954)|
| 0:32:45| rather than making it now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1965)|
| 0:32:49| From a procedural standpoint, would that not be better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1969)|
| 0:32:52| Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1974)|
| 0:32:55| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| Yes, I mean, again, as I think you all are agreeing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1977)|
| 0:33:03| I mean, any board member can bring a motion at any time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1983)|
| 0:33:07| but I do agree with what you're saying, Mr. McMillan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1987)|
| 0:33:10| is that the proposal is for the director of schools to go ahead and present the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1990)|
| 0:33:17| and then after that, public forum, and then after public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=1997)|
| 0:33:21| certainly this board, Ms. Owens or any other member can present a motion at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2001)|
| 0:33:29| and then go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| At that point, my belief is that at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2011)|
| 0:33:36| any board member could criticize certain aspects or praise any aspects or any route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2016)|
| 0:33:46| and I think it would, that's why I say it's procedural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2026)|
| 0:33:52| Nobody is going to deny anybody, any board member, the right to, I don't think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2032)|
| 0:33:59| I know I'm not, to say what you want to say about the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2039)|
| 0:34:07| So I don't see, I just think that would be a better way of doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2047)|
| 0:34:14| That's what I was envisioning, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| Ms. Fabb, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2057)|
| 0:34:19| Yeah, I just want to say, I mean, I feel like it's been kind of insinuated tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2059)|
| 0:34:22| and I've got some emails about our lack of transparency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2062)|
| 0:34:25| and I had someone like, we need to make these meetings streamed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2065)|
| 0:34:28| and I'm like, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2068)|
| 0:34:31| I have not gone because I couldn't go to some of the meetings for some health requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2071)|
| 0:34:36| I could from home watch the meetings other than sometimes having trouble finding them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2076)|
| 0:34:40| but, I mean, we put it out there, and if there is a miscommunication out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2080)|
| 0:34:46| that we are not letting people see our meetings, the task force meetings were all televised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2086)|
| 0:34:50| Our meetings are televised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| They're recorded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2092)|
| 0:34:53| If you can't watch them live, you can go back and watch them and speed over them if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2093)|
| 0:34:57| So I'm not sure where, you know, did people want the plan a month ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2097)|
| 0:35:04| Yes, we all did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2104)|
| 0:35:05| But, I mean, you know, that's not meaning we are not transparent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2105)|
| 0:35:08| and we're not getting information out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| So I don't know where this idea that we are not letting people into our meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2110)|
| 0:35:16| We are trying to let people know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2116)|
| 0:35:20| I mean, yes, maybe we should communicate some things differently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| but I do think we try to be as open with our meetings as we possibly can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2122)|
| 0:35:28| and for those that are confused about it, please contact me, and I'll try to help you find them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2128)|
| 0:35:33| Thank you, Ms. Fab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2133)|
| 0:35:34| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2134)|
| 0:35:36| Could we have some clarification from the superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2136)|
| 0:35:39| on how many focus group meetings were open to the public and noticed to the press?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2139)|
| 0:35:47| Can we just have the presentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| Because I think if we...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2149)|
| 0:35:50| Well, I'm being called a liar, so I would like some clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2150)|
| 0:35:56| If I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2156)|
| 0:35:57| Ms. Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2157)|
| 0:35:58| If I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2158)|
| 0:35:59| I am thinking, and Ms. Owen, I don't mean to speak for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2159)|
| 0:36:04| but I'm thinking that this motion was made because with just what is out there in public on the printed agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2164)|
| 0:36:15| the perception is that Mr. Thomas is going to present this plan, and that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2175)|
| 0:36:27| Even though it is a fluid document, I think perception has been that this is what the plan is going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2187)|
| 0:36:38| and there's no room for the Board of Education to, in fact, make a motion or propose any changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2198)|
| 0:36:50| And I think that is probably what has garnered so many emails and so much concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2210)|
| 0:36:56| when statements have been made that this is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2216)|
| 0:37:04| So I think that that was the spirit of Ms. Owen's motion, and my spirit in a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2224)|
| 0:37:12| in that we all will have a right to speak up and certainly make any motion to change any part of this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2232)|
| 0:37:23| Absolutely, as we always do in issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2243)|
| 0:37:26| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2246)|
| 0:37:30| I was just waiting to see if there were going to be answers to those questions, but I can ask them later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2250)|
| 0:37:36| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2256)|
| 0:37:39| The question was about focus groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2259)|
| 0:37:44| Okay, so we have a motion on the floor to have discussion regarding this topic after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2264)|
| 0:37:52| Is it acceptable if we have the discussion after the presentation and after public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2272)|
| 0:37:59| All right, any other discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| Okay, all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2282)|
| 0:38:05| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2287)|
| 0:38:08| Okay, so Mr. Thomas, we will turn the floor over to you for your presentation, and then we'll have public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2288)|
| 0:38:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2297)|
| 0:38:18| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2298)|
| 0:38:20| I appreciate very much your patience as we crafted the plan that's in front of you this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2300)|
| 0:38:25| Yes, we would have all loved to have had it sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2305)|
| 0:38:27| It's been a lot of work put into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2307)|
| 0:38:31| Before I get started too far into this, I would just like to thank the staff, our executive team staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2311)|
| 0:38:36| and the folks that work with them for all the hours that they have spent working on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2316)|
| 0:38:42| and the time that they spent working on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2322)|
| 0:38:46| So thank you, staff and team, for all of your long hours and hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2326)|
| 0:38:53| I know our community has been eagerly awaiting this announcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2333)|
| 0:38:57| and in a minute I'm going to unpack some of the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| But before that, I just wanted to begin by outlining some of our goals in very broad strokes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2340)|
| 0:39:05| As you'll see, this plan provides back-to-school, in-person learning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2345)|
| 0:39:10| which is something that many of our families felt essential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| So, again, one of the goals in school, back in school and learning in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2353)|
| 0:39:19| At the same time, it puts safety measures in place to protect the health and the well-being of our students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2359)|
| 0:39:24| our teachers, our staff who are returning to our school buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2364)|
| 0:39:29| Number three, it was clear that some families simply did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2369)|
| 0:39:33| and were not ready to return to the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2373)|
| 0:39:35| So this plan provides those students and families with a virtual learning program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2375)|
| 0:39:40| which they can assess using the Chromebooks provided under our one-to-one initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2380)|
| 0:39:46| It's also important, and it was mentioned in the task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| that they did not think that budget should limit and constrain us in terms of providing safety measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2389)|
| 0:39:57| So this plan is not limited by budgetary constraints that would prevent the implementation of safety measures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2397)|
| 0:40:03| or that would prevent us from providing learning opportunities for all students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2403)|
| 0:40:07| And I think that was something that was mentioned also as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2407)|
| 0:40:10| that whatever our opportunities are must be available to all students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2410)|
| 0:40:16| As of today, we've spent a little over $800,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2416)|
| 0:40:21| And these are unbudgeted as we went through the budget process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2421)|
| 0:40:24| but $800,000 providing safety measures and getting ready for the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2424)|
| 0:40:32| And this is a rough estimate, a very rough estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2432)|
| 0:40:35| We would probably project to spend somewhere between $4 million and $5 million more throughout the year for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2435)|
| 0:40:43| And that does not include the virtual learning program, the positions that are included in the virtual learning program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2443)|
| 0:40:50| And if you looked at that, we're probably talking more like about $8 million to $9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2450)|
| 0:40:55| But, again, the virtual learning program is something I wouldn't say that's necessarily COVID-related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2455)|
| 0:41:01| It is, but it isn't, because that's something we would continue post-COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2461)|
| 0:41:06| So we're looking at probably $4 million to $5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2466)|
| 0:41:10| And, again, that's just a guesstimate at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2470)|
| 0:41:12| It could be more, it could be less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| Next, I'd like to reiterate a couple of things I've said before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2474)|
| 0:41:18| First of all, I'm very grateful for the input that we received from the community, including the survey respondents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2478)|
| 0:41:23| over 32,000, I believe, the focus groups and community task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2483)|
| 0:41:27| I was asked a question about the focus groups, and no, those were not open to the public, if I can answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2487)|
| 0:41:33| Actually, when REA, our research department, did focus groups, I asked to participate in those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2493)|
| 0:41:38| and I wasn't even allowed to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2498)|
| 0:41:41| And the reason for that, it was explained to me, was your presence might interfere with the responses that we get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2501)|
| 0:41:49| So we feel like it's better that you are not part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2509)|
| 0:41:52| So, okay, I said, yeah, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2512)|
| 0:41:54| So I conducted focus group meetings myself with the same folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2514)|
| 0:41:58| and gave folks an opportunity to answer questions and give their input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2518)|
| 0:42:03| And although those weren't open to the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2523)|
| 0:42:07| I think some of the conversations involved some sensitive topics, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2527)|
| 0:42:11| that would have not been right to have had on a public basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2531)|
| 0:42:17| because it involved some specific situations with students, teachers, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2537)|
| 0:42:22| So, although, having said that, I think there were a couple of retired teachers, maybe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2542)|
| 0:42:28| that participated in the teacher focus group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2548)|
| 0:42:31| And then the community task force, as we heard their report last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2551)|
| 0:42:36| So this feedback has been essential for our planning process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2556)|
| 0:42:39| and I sincerely appreciate everyone who took the time to share their thoughts and concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2559)|
| 0:42:44| And I would also like to thank Dr. Buchanan and our partners at the health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2564)|
| 0:42:49| because they have made themselves available on a very regular, frequent basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2569)|
| 0:42:55| to help us in developing this plan and providing their insight and their guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2575)|
| 0:43:01| So a special thank you to Dr. Buchanan and her staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2581)|
| 0:43:05| Also, our elementary and secondary principals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2585)|
| 0:43:08| We met with them a couple of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| Most recently, it was just the other day, and got their input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2590)|
| 0:43:15| tried to answer their questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| and incorporated some of their suggestions into the document you have this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2597)|
| 0:43:23| I'd also like to thank Tanya Coates, our KCEA president,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2603)|
| 0:43:29| and our KCEA collaborative conferencing team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2609)|
| 0:43:33| We met with them yesterday, although the topic wasn't the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2613)|
| 0:43:37| The topic was getting the MOU on the agenda for our August meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2617)|
| 0:43:41| and getting it approved and signed and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| But we took that opportunity to go through with our collaborative conferencing team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2623)|
| 0:43:49| go through the plan, and, again, some excellent suggestions came out of that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2629)|
| 0:43:53| And I just appreciate folks hanging around for an extra hour and a half, two hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2633)|
| 0:43:59| while they're not on contract, just to give us an opportunity to go through the plan with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2639)|
| 0:44:05| So thank you to KCEA and our collaborative conferencing teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2645)|
| 0:44:10| Second, I want to ask our stakeholders for an extra measure of grace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2650)|
| 0:44:14| I mentioned that before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| So as we move towards reopening, and I've said this before, it's not going to be perfect on day one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2656)|
| 0:44:22| I wish it would be perfect on day one, but it's probably not going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2662)|
| 0:44:27| You know, we're going to make some mistakes, and I'll own that up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2667)|
| 0:44:30| But I will say I can assure you that as a district, we're determined to get better every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2670)|
| 0:44:35| and correct the mistakes that we make and have, in the end, a product that, on all counts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2675)|
| 0:44:42| that our community is going to be very proud of and also is going to make our school system even greater than what it is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2682)|
| 0:44:49| And with the support of the community, we'll be able to meet the challenges posed by COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2689)|
| 0:44:56| And with that, I'll move into our plan with slide one to have a short PowerPoint presentation for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2696)|
| 0:45:05| But one of the things that has become clear in listening to our stakeholders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2705)|
| 0:45:09| and particularly our principals and teachers, is that schools will need extra time to plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2709)|
| 0:45:15| and prepare for reopening once teachers are back on contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2715)|
| 0:45:18| Our teachers come back on contract August 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2718)|
| 0:45:24| So this, what we would ask is that providing them with some extra time, an additional week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2724)|
| 0:45:30| to plan and prepare for the reopening once teachers, once they're back on August 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2730)|
| 0:45:35| This would include building parallel schedules for both our on-campus students and our virtual program students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2735)|
| 0:45:42| So with that in mind, our starting date for students has been moved back by a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2742)|
| 0:45:48| That means that students will now, their first day would be Monday, August 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2748)|
| 0:45:54| And again, this will give us time to adjust our procedures, deploy the Chromebooks to students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2754)|
| 0:46:00| And Chromebooks will, they are arriving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2760)|
| 0:46:03| They're kind of coming in stages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2763)|
| 0:46:05| We, I think maybe a week or so ago, received 1,500 of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2765)|
| 0:46:09| And I think 5,000 were scheduled to be delivered this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2769)|
| 0:46:13| And then over the next few weeks, I think we'll be getting them in increments of about 5,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2773)|
| 0:46:18| so until we have the 40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2778)|
| 0:46:21| But it would allow us time to deploy the Chromebooks to answer questions from our families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2781)|
| 0:46:26| and implement our health and safety measures that are critical for this plan's success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2786)|
| 0:46:32| Now, how do we get an extra week in the calendar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2792)|
| 0:46:35| What we're asking or doing, and we'll be asking that we have asked the state for a waiver,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2795)|
| 0:46:40| to use five of our inclement weather days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2800)|
| 0:46:44| And this will leave us with five days for the remainder of the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2804)|
| 0:46:48| You know, we start out, by the times that we attend school, we earn ten inclement weather days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2808)|
| 0:46:54| So we would use five of those days and have five days remaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2814)|
| 0:46:58| One thing, though, that's different, even with fewer inclement weather days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2818)|
| 0:47:02| that we haven't been able to do in the past is to have instruction on those days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2822)|
| 0:47:06| So with having Chromebooks and being one-to-one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2826)|
| 0:47:10| there's an opportunity there to give us a little bit more flexibility and to continue instruction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2830)|
| 0:47:15| even when buildings are closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| And I know our students will love that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2837)|
| 0:47:19| And if they're closed because of inclement weather or illness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2839)|
| 0:47:24| then we would have that opportunity, providing that folks have electricity, obviously, to power their devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2844)|
| 0:47:30| But we would have opportunities to use our one-to-one or our laptops for instruction on those days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2850)|
| 0:47:39| So that's a little different than it's been in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2859)|
| 0:47:42| And, again, just want to thank the board enough for your support on the one-to-one initiative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2862)|
| 0:47:47| because that's going to really allow us to do some things we haven't been able to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2867)|
| 0:47:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2872)|
| 0:47:53| When school begins on August 17th, what does that look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2873)|
| 0:47:56| We'll have two options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| The first is to attend class on our school campuses with additional safety measures in place to prevent the spread of COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2878)|
| 0:48:05| The second option is to enroll in our virtual learning program, which will provide instruction remotely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2885)|
| 0:48:11| And in a moment I'll share more details about both options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2891)|
| 0:48:15| But I do want to emphasize that whichever options families choose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2895)|
| 0:48:19| they will be committed to that option for an entire semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2899)|
| 0:48:23| Now, initially we talked about wanting to give families more flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2903)|
| 0:48:27| But having talked with our principals and looking at it a little closer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2907)|
| 0:48:30| it's become clear that in order to organize our classrooms and allocate the resources in a manner that we need to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2910)|
| 0:48:37| we would ask for a firm commitment for the full semester if you're in person or if you're in the virtual learning program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2917)|
| 0:48:47| Now, in preparation for the upcoming school year, we've also created three primary indicators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2927)|
| 0:48:54| Those indicators are green, and you'll see this in the plan, green, yellow, and red,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2934)|
| 0:48:59| to help us clearly communicate what the expectations and the requirements will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2939)|
| 0:49:04| So green would be the green light to do everything like we've done it before, standard operating procedures, pre-COVID, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2944)|
| 0:49:12| Now, in all likelihood, I don't see green happening right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2952)|
| 0:49:17| I'm hopeful that a vaccine or some type of a cure or whatever will be developed so that we can eventually get back to green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2957)|
| 0:49:26| But in the meantime, yellow would represent being in school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2966)|
| 0:49:30| but it would be the increased safety protocols that would be enforced while we're in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2970)|
| 0:49:38| And then red means that everyone would move to remote learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2978)|
| 0:49:42| So in a situation like today, where we are, we'd probably be in yellow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2982)|
| 0:49:48| We would be operating in yellow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2988)|
| 0:49:51| And where we were back in March when we closed would be an example of red.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2991)|
| 0:49:56| But again, back in March when we closed, we weren't able to do what we will be able to do with the one-to-one initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=2996)|
| 0:50:04| If you recall in March, the best we could do was provide the learning packets that review items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3004)|
| 0:50:10| There was no new instruction introduced and testing and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3010)|
| 0:50:15| We weren't able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3015)|
| 0:50:16| So again, for this coming year, we will be able to provide those new learning and testing and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3016)|
| 0:50:23| So as I said, we'd start the year on yellow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3023)|
| 0:50:27| And also under this plan, it's possible for some schools to be on yellow and some schools to be on red.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3027)|
| 0:50:33| For example, if there was a cluster in our county in a particular school that that school needed to operate in red,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3033)|
| 0:50:41| then we could do that and everybody else might be in yellow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3041)|
| 0:50:44| Or it could be a situation where multiple schools were in red and other schools were in yellow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3044)|
| 0:50:51| So what will these options look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3051)|
| 0:50:54| For students who return to school, the academic program will be largely unchanged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3054)|
| 0:51:00| but with additional health and safety measures needed to address COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3060)|
| 0:51:04| The look and the feel of the school day will be very different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3064)|
| 0:51:09| We will be focusing on additional mitigation strategies to prevent the spread of the virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3069)|
| 0:51:15| For example, first of all, temperature checks will be conducted on every person who enters our school buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3075)|
| 0:51:21| in order to identify students and staff and visitors who have a fever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3081)|
| 0:51:26| Second, we will provide hand sanitizer and disinfectant to every classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3086)|
| 0:51:31| and then implement stepped up cleaning protocols in an effort to prevent the spread of COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3091)|
| 0:51:37| And finally, all students and staff who are able to wear a mask will be required to do so when physical distancing is not possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3097)|
| 0:51:46| You know, mask, it's inconvenient and it's awkward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3106)|
| 0:51:49| We realize that some parents I know are uncomfortable with asking their students to take this step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3109)|
| 0:51:54| However, according to the CDC and fairly recent information, and we've heard it for months now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3114)|
| 0:51:59| wearing a mask is the most effective way to slow or stop the virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3119)|
| 0:52:04| So again, wearing a mask is a way for all of us to care for each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3124)|
| 0:52:11| Our second option is a virtual learning program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3131)|
| 0:52:15| Students will be able to enroll in this program actually starting today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3135)|
| 0:52:19| And the last day to enroll will be Wednesday, July 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3139)|
| 0:52:23| That's a week window, which is relatively short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3143)|
| 0:52:26| However, we did survey parents about the virtual learning plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3146)|
| 0:52:31| So it is information that we have shared while to give parents an opportunity to be thinking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3151)|
| 0:52:38| So we've got the enrollment closed, scheduled right now for July 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3158)|
| 0:52:43| Participating families will be required to attend an orientation session to prepare for this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3163)|
| 0:52:51| The virtual learning, of course, would take place using the Chromebooks provided under the district's one-to-one initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3171)|
| 0:52:57| And the virtual learning program will closely align with the requirements of an on-campus classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3177)|
| 0:53:04| It will include instruction on new material, graded assignments, and also testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3184)|
| 0:53:11| And while this program will not be able to offer all course options available at our traditional schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3191)|
| 0:53:16| students will remain on track to move to the next grade or to graduate, whichever the case may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3196)|
| 0:53:25| I'd like to announce also to reassure students and families that our virtual learning program is being implemented with fidelity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3205)|
| 0:53:33| The following individuals have been appointed as principals and assistant principals for the virtual learning program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3213)|
| 0:53:42| Leanne Hahn, who is executive principal of Career Magnet Academy, will be the virtual program principal, special assignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3222)|
| 0:53:49| And Leanne is here, so thank you, Leanne, for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3229)|
| 0:53:53| And for grades 7 through 12, so your work is cut out for you, so I know you're very capable and able,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3233)|
| 0:54:00| and we'll look forward to seeing all the work you're going to produce in really a short amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3240)|
| 0:54:06| Also, Jennifer Garrett, and I think Jennifer is here. Jennifer, thank you for being here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3246)|
| 0:54:12| She is executive principal of Paul Kelly Academy, but will be principal in grades K through 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3252)|
| 0:54:18| So, again, a lot of work that you're going to be doing over the next few weeks, and then after that, a lot more work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3258)|
| 0:54:25| So, thank you for your interest in the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3265)|
| 0:54:29| Also, Zach Brewer, assistant principal at Moreland Heights Elementary, is going to be a virtual program assistant principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3269)|
| 0:54:36| And Chris Layton, assistant principal at Jefferson Middle in Oak Ridge, will be virtual program assistant principal for grades 7 through 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3276)|
| 0:54:46| A lot of times, not really bragging here, but a lot of times we lose folks to Oak Ridge, so this time it's reversed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3286)|
| 0:54:54| So, appreciate Chris's interest in applying for the job, and know that our folks are going to do excellent work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3294)|
| 0:55:01| as we venture into the world of virtual learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3301)|
| 0:55:07| I know that for many families, choosing between in-person and virtual learning is a difficult decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3307)|
| 0:55:13| It not only affects the work of teaching and learning, but will also require families to consider broader issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3313)|
| 0:55:19| related to child care, student health, and the demands placed on working parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3319)|
| 0:55:25| And with that in mind, we've tried to anticipate as many of the questions as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3325)|
| 0:55:29| and provide clear answers that are easily accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3329)|
| 0:55:33| So, details about this plan are now available at knoxschools.org slash connect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3333)|
| 0:55:38| So, I would encourage parents, families, tonight to, if you're not already online, get online and go to knoxschools.org slash connect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3338)|
| 0:55:46| and look at all the exciting things that are going to be available to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3346)|
| 0:55:53| Also on the site, you'll find a full plan along with summary documents, frequently asked questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3353)|
| 0:55:58| and over time, these documents will be updated to reflect new questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3358)|
| 0:56:02| There may be things, although I think we've done a really good job of thinking of everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3362)|
| 0:56:06| I'm sure that folks will think of things we haven't thought of, so we'll take those questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3366)|
| 0:56:11| and we'll be glad to answer them and to also put them on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3371)|
| 0:56:17| And also, I haven't talked a lot about this because this deals mostly with families and students, of course, and teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3377)|
| 0:56:24| but also we have a school-based workforce management plan for our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3384)|
| 0:56:30| And this document is posted on our website as well and goes into more details about what is available for employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3390)|
| 0:56:36| who may have underlying health conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3396)|
| 0:56:39| Maybe you don't have an underlying health condition, but you know what, I'm just concerned about coming back to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3399)|
| 0:56:44| and I just don't know right now if I want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3404)|
| 0:56:47| So, again, go to the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| We've got that information on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3409)|
| 0:56:51| We've taken a look and going by the Families First Coronavirus Response Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3411)|
| 0:56:57| Also, we have policies where folks can take a medical leave of absence, user sick leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3417)|
| 0:57:04| And also, right now, what we're granting folks, as I mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3424)|
| 0:57:08| there may be folks who just are not comfortable coming back to work right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3428)|
| 0:57:11| Hey, I want to wait and see how this plays out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3431)|
| 0:57:16| So, if you want to take an administrative leave without pay for a semester and still have your job protected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3436)|
| 0:57:24| then we're also doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3444)|
| 0:57:26| Again, it's a leave without pay for a semester,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3446)|
| 0:57:29| but to give employees who maybe just are really concerned about coming back right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3449)|
| 0:57:34| an opportunity to also keep their job and come back at a later time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3454)|
| 0:57:40| And I would like to say, too, just remind everyone that circumstances can change quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3460)|
| 0:57:48| And we've all experienced that over the last few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3468)|
| 0:57:52| Right now, you know, things are not looking as good because the number of positive cases is going up every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3472)|
| 0:57:58| The number of hospitalizations is going up every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3478)|
| 0:58:02| And we're tuned into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3482)|
| 0:58:04| And I don't think if we don't get started on August the 3rd and use those 10 days with our staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3484)|
| 0:58:11| and with our teachers developing these plans, then we're going to be right back where we were in March if we're not in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3491)|
| 0:58:19| And there's a possibility we want to start out in school and also with the virtual learning program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3499)|
| 0:58:26| But if things get worse and in consultation with the health department and the state, the directive is you're not going to be back in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3506)|
| 0:58:34| We want to be ready and we need to be ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3514)|
| 0:58:37| Have the computers deployed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3517)|
| 0:58:39| Have our teachers ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3519)|
| 0:58:41| And if we're operating in red, we'll be ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3521)|
| 0:58:44| So there's still tonight is the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3524)|
| 0:58:48| Students come back on the 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3528)|
| 0:58:50| Teachers come back on the 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3530)|
| 0:58:52| There's still a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3532)|
| 0:58:53| There's still four weeks for us to take a look at everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3533)|
| 0:58:57| And, again, it's not just our decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3537)|
| 0:59:00| We're going to be working with the health department and the folks responsible for the health and the welfare of this whole community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3540)|
| 0:59:07| and our employees and our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3547)|
| 0:59:08| So I just wanted to take a minute there and just reassure everybody that this could change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3548)|
| 0:59:15| Just because whether you vote on it tonight or you don't vote on it tonight, it could change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3555)|
| 0:59:22| And we're going to keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3562)|
| 0:59:25| And, again, safety of our students and our staff is first and foremost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3565)|
| 0:59:31| But, okay, my hope is that by embracing physical distancing, hand washing and wearing masks, we will be able to diminish the impact of COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3571)|
| 0:59:40| And I'd just like to say again, the CDC has said if you want to stop or you want to prevent COVID-19, you want to stop the spread, wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3580)|
| 0:59:50| So hoping our parents are listening and understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3590)|
| 0:59:54| Again, it's for the safety of our students and the safety of our staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3594)|
| 0:59:59| and for us to have the opportunity to get back to something that resembles normal, even though it's going to be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3599)|
| 1:00:06| So this school year won't be easy, but our students are worth the struggle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3606)|
| 1:00:11| And our students are resilient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3611)|
| 1:00:13| We've got the best teachers, I'm convinced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3613)|
| 1:00:16| I get to meet with them regularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3616)|
| 1:00:18| It just makes me want to smile when I talk about how great our teachers are and our administrators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3618)|
| 1:00:23| And they're going to make it work, and they're going to work hard to make it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3623)|
| 1:00:26| So I just want to reassure families of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3626)|
| 1:00:29| And by working together, I know we can overcome the challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3629)|
| 1:00:33| And there are going to be many, but we can overcome them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| So with that, Madam Chair, members of the board, staff and I are happy to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3635)|
| 1:00:40| We have the staff, as I said earlier, the folks here that have worked really hard on the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3640)|
| 1:00:45| and certainly experts in their areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3645)|
| 1:00:48| So they're ready to address questions that you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3648)|
| 1:00:51| And thank you very much for this opportunity to talk about our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3651)|
| 1:00:56| Thank you, Superintendent Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3656)|
| 1:00:57| And we look forward to, I'm sure we'll have lots of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3657)|
| 1:01:00| But Ms. Spad, first, can we have public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3660)|
| 1:01:03| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3663)|
| 1:01:04| I'm calling Christy Rouse for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3664)|
| 1:01:17| And after Christy, just so she can be prepared, we have Sandy Bush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3677)|
| 1:01:35| Ms. Rouse, if you will just state your name and county of residence when you start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3695)|
| 1:01:38| and then you'll have five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3698)|
| 1:01:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3700)|
| 1:01:41| I'm Sandy Bush, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3701)|
| 1:01:42| Christy and I are representing the same group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3702)|
| 1:01:45| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3705)|
| 1:01:46| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3706)|
| 1:01:47| No, that's totally fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3707)|
| 1:01:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3708)|
| 1:01:49| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3709)|
| 1:01:50| I'm Sandy Bush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3710)|
| 1:01:51| I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3711)|
| 1:01:52| I live in District 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3712)|
| 1:01:54| So I actually emailed the board just kind of like my personal story,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3714)|
| 1:01:59| and several of you responded back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3719)|
| 1:02:01| So I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3721)|
| 1:02:03| Can you hear me okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3723)|
| 1:02:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3724)|
| 1:02:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3725)|
| 1:02:06| So I shared more of my personal story, but today I am more representing a group of parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3726)|
| 1:02:13| So thank you for letting me speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3733)|
| 1:02:16| Sorry, my printer printed this off very small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3736)|
| 1:02:19| I would like to say thank you for allowing me to speak here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3739)|
| 1:02:24| While my time may be brief, I'm speaking on behalf of a silent but mighty group of parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3744)|
| 1:02:30| Currently, there are an estimated 8,000 students enrolled in Knox County with an IEP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3750)|
| 1:02:35| according to the National Center for Education Statistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3755)|
| 1:02:39| This accounts for roughly 13% of all students in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3759)|
| 1:02:44| On July 8th, at the Working Group Board meeting, Dr. Askew spoke that the parents who are most concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3764)|
| 1:02:53| about their child's education are currently parents of children with IEPs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3773)|
| 1:02:57| I would like to thank Dr. Askew for his attention to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3777)|
| 1:03:00| As a parent, I often feel that my child's education is overlooked, left behind, or placed last in line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3780)|
| 1:03:08| And I do want to let you all know that I did read the reopening guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3788)|
| 1:03:13| I had a chance just right before this started, and I do appreciate that there was a section in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3793)|
| 1:03:21| but I did feel that this was still relevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3801)|
| 1:03:24| So I wanted to go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| As a group of parents from all nine districts, we are not silent, and we do not want to be silent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3806)|
| 1:03:32| Our children have the right to access free, appropriate public education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3812)|
| 1:03:36| From March to May 2020, COVID mandated the emergency shutdown of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3816)|
| 1:03:42| and many of us received less communication for our children with IEPs than our children without IEPs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3822)|
| 1:03:48| On an average, we received just 10% of the communication than that of our students in the general ed population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3828)|
| 1:03:54| When speaking privately with our general education teachers, we hear the same comments from them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3834)|
| 1:03:59| that they feel expendable and uncared for and unheard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3839)|
| 1:04:03| We, the parents, communicate with one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3843)|
| 1:04:06| We work together to know the current laws protecting the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act for our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3846)|
| 1:04:13| And with little to no district communication given to us, many of us have great relationships with our children's case managers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3853)|
| 1:04:19| and we see the love and care they have for our students with special needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3859)|
| 1:04:23| We value the work the case managers and the special education teachers do, but we also recognize that we are their parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3863)|
| 1:04:31| As parents, we are organizing. We've been holding weekly meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3871)|
| 1:04:35| We've met with COVID Task Force Manager Joan Grimm, Senator Becky Massey, and members for the Arc for East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3875)|
| 1:04:43| We do not want our children's service hours reduced, but we are open to new ways of meeting those service hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3883)|
| 1:04:49| We recognize that there is no one-size-fits-all for our children, but we also must point out that our students' IEPs are legally binding documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3889)|
| 1:04:56| I've had parents reach out to me from one end of the IEP spectrum to another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3896)|
| 1:05:01| While I admit your task is very large, there are many helping hands sitting idly by, watching and anxiously waiting to help us, the parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3901)|
| 1:05:10| An IEP team is described as all collaborative members involved in the child's education who have individual needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3910)|
| 1:05:17| There have been many months this year, more months than not, that the parents have played all roles on this team, PT, OT, speech therapists, than the members of the team individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3917)|
| 1:05:30| Yet Knox County has prepared a plan without consulting us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3930)|
| 1:05:33| We feel that the district has lacked empathy and care for the people that they serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3933)|
| 1:05:38| We want our children, the teachers, and the staff to be safe in an appropriate learning environment, and we want to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3938)|
| 1:05:45| We want fair treatment and learning for our children with IEPs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3945)|
| 1:05:49| Thank you very much for hearing me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3949)|
| 1:05:51| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3951)|
| 1:05:52| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3952)|
| 1:05:58| Deaver Shattuck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3958)|
| 1:06:08| And if you'll just state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3968)|
| 1:06:11| Yes, my name is Deaver Shattuck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3971)|
| 1:06:12| I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3972)|
| 1:06:14| I am a proud father of five, a proud husband.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3974)|
| 1:06:17| I have four grown children who have graduated from Knox County, have a daughter at Bearden Middle now, and one of my oldest daughter is going to start at Vine Middle as a teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3977)|
| 1:06:27| So I want to really start off and say thank you all for what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3987)|
| 1:06:31| So nobody runs for school board and serves on school board for power or for prestige.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3991)|
| 1:06:36| You all do this because you love our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3996)|
| 1:06:38| So I appreciate that, and most parents appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=3998)|
| 1:06:42| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4002)|
| 1:06:43| Nobody joined the school board thinking they were going to have to sit here and make this kind of a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4003)|
| 1:06:48| So I do not envy your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4008)|
| 1:06:51| I also stand before you as a physician, and so I will just go ahead and say I'm not a public speaker, so my stage fright will get me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4011)|
| 1:06:59| But I'm a hospital physician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4019)|
| 1:07:00| I run the hospital service at one of the local hospitals, and I'm also medical director at three nursing homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4020)|
| 1:07:05| So everything I'm going to say here is my opinion, but it's well-informed opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4025)|
| 1:07:10| Unfortunately, I'm sort of the bad news doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4030)|
| 1:07:15| So since I just take care of critical care patients, acute care patients, and nursing home patients, they're all sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4035)|
| 1:07:21| And I will say that COVID is real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4041)|
| 1:07:23| We have had patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4043)|
| 1:07:24| I had a patient die yesterday with the COVID disease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4044)|
| 1:07:26| It's very real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4046)|
| 1:07:27| It's very, very serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4047)|
| 1:07:29| We're developing better care, but there is no cure and unlikely to be an effective vaccine for months and months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4049)|
| 1:07:35| and certainly not an effective vaccine that we're going to have widely available to our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4055)|
| 1:07:42| So unfortunately, I'm here to speak truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4062)|
| 1:07:44| I'm not the doctor that you come to to hear what you want to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4064)|
| 1:07:48| I, like all other parents, really want my daughter back in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4068)|
| 1:07:52| She's a social kid, and she needs to see her friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4072)|
| 1:07:56| But just because that's what we wish for doesn't mean the way it's going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4076)|
| 1:08:00| COVID really stinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4080)|
| 1:08:02| I know everybody's sick of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4082)|
| 1:08:03| They're sick of being closed down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4083)|
| 1:08:04| They're sick of being out of school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4084)|
| 1:08:06| We need our school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4086)|
| 1:08:07| We need our kids in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4087)|
| 1:08:08| But it is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4088)|
| 1:08:11| I also have read the plan you all put together, and clearly a tremendous amount of thought went into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4091)|
| 1:08:17| a tremendous amount of effort and time went into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4097)|
| 1:08:19| And I want to personally thank the superintendent for that effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4099)|
| 1:08:22| There is a lot in that plan to really like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4102)|
| 1:08:24| I especially appreciate that there is an online option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4104)|
| 1:08:38| So I think parents really appreciate that, and I think that's fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4118)|
| 1:08:42| I appreciate a lot of the safety measures that are going in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4122)|
| 1:08:45| But the piece that's really missing and the piece that I'm very concerned about is the masking requirement is not nearly stringent enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4125)|
| 1:08:53| We cannot have words like masking except when social distancing is not possible in a mass gathering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4133)|
| 1:09:02| The classroom is a mass gathering, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4142)|
| 1:09:05| We as a community are not good at masking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4145)|
| 1:09:08| When I stand in this room, I see almost half the board members aren't correctly masked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4148)|
| 1:09:12| How can we expect our kids to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4152)|
| 1:09:17| When I work in the hospital, we have policies about visitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4157)|
| 1:09:21| All our visitors are expected to mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4161)|
| 1:09:23| They don't mask great, so the nurses and the doctors have to go and tell them to mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4163)|
| 1:09:29| It's really an impediment to the therapeutic relationship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4169)|
| 1:09:32| and I can't imagine the barrier it's going to be for teachers to require masking in the classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4172)|
| 1:09:37| because it's going to be the constant excuse of, I can't breathe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4177)|
| 1:09:41| My parent says I don't have to mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4181)|
| 1:09:43| Unfortunately, the masking has been politicized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4183)|
| 1:09:46| So all that's very unfortunate, and masking is by far the most important thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4186)|
| 1:09:51| It's not about you can't socially distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4191)|
| 1:09:53| If you sit kids in a classroom, 20 kids breathing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4193)|
| 1:09:57| the teacher who has to stand in the classroom for six hours is going to have a massive viral load exposure if those kids aren't masked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4197)|
| 1:10:05| So it's not about social distancing in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4205)|
| 1:10:07| It's a mass gathering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4207)|
| 1:10:09| That's dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4209)|
| 1:10:14| I really ask that we really be fed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4214)|
| 1:10:17| I'm not saying to keep the schools closed, but that's a critical safety feature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4217)|
| 1:10:22| Kids do get this disease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4222)|
| 1:10:25| We've had three children under 10 die in Tennessee in this pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4225)|
| 1:10:30| That's before really the teeth of the pandemic has struck us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4230)|
| 1:10:34| We're right in the middle of that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4234)|
| 1:10:36| More children will die, and I fear if we open schools without adequate masking, we're going to face that tragedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4236)|
| 1:10:43| I deal with death a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4243)|
| 1:10:45| Our kids, y'all, our teachers, our schools, our community don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4245)|
| 1:10:50| Y'all don't want to have to deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4250)|
| 1:10:53| Y'all are going to take that responsibility on your shoulders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4253)|
| 1:10:56| If you don't keep the teachers, especially, who I do fear will get sick, and I'm afraid we're going to lose teachers if we don't mask adequately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4256)|
| 1:11:04| So I would implore you to beef that piece of this reopening up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4264)|
| 1:11:08| That may take some more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4268)|
| 1:11:10| Frankly, I would recommend that you have N95 masks for all the teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4270)|
| 1:11:13| They'd be required to wear them all day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4273)|
| 1:11:16| That's how we're going to keep our teachers safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4276)|
| 1:11:20| I want to say that there's been a lot of talk of the false choice of choosing our economy over our safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4280)|
| 1:11:27| It's truly a false choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4287)|
| 1:11:29| We have to be safe and defeat this virus if we're going to have an economic recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4289)|
| 1:11:33| The way we're going to have economic recovery is to get the thing defeated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4293)|
| 1:11:37| The way to defeat it is to deny the virus its human host.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4297)|
| 1:11:40| You put kids in schools, you're giving them human hosts to spread amongst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4300)|
| 1:11:44| So, again, we've got to mask them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4304)|
| 1:11:46| We've got to do better with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4306)|
| 1:11:52| Kids are going to get this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4312)|
| 1:11:53| They're going to be asymptomatic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4313)|
| 1:11:54| They're going to spread it to their parents and grandparents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4314)|
| 1:11:56| That's going to keep our community sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4316)|
| 1:12:01| One of my physicians, she got the virus from her five-year-old child who was in daycare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4321)|
| 1:12:07| That happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4327)|
| 1:12:09| It's going to happen a lot in the coming months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4329)|
| 1:12:12| You all don't want the parents and the grandparents' deaths on your hands either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4332)|
| 1:12:19| So, I just urge you to consider those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4339)|
| 1:12:23| I urge parents to use the online option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4343)|
| 1:12:26| I believe using the online option is going to keep you safe, your kids safe, our community safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4346)|
| 1:12:32| It will open our economy quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4352)|
| 1:12:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4355)|
| 1:12:37| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4357)|
| 1:12:39| Lance McCold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4359)|
| 1:12:52| Lance McCold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4372)|
| 1:12:57| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4377)|
| 1:13:10| My name is Lance McCold, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4390)|
| 1:13:13| Thank you for letting me come speak to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4393)|
| 1:13:18| Well, I appreciate the doctor who came to speak to us before because I think most of us are pretty worried about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4398)|
| 1:13:27| I guess the one thing I want to talk about is, well, a couple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4407)|
| 1:13:34| Mr. Thomas and his staff have done a great job trying to figure out how best to deal with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4414)|
| 1:13:41| and get our kids back in school, and everybody wants the kids back in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4421)|
| 1:13:46| But it's going to be really hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4426)|
| 1:13:50| And if we do it wrong, people are going to die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4430)|
| 1:13:57| So, I've been asking myself, well, what is keeping us from doing the job right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4437)|
| 1:14:03| You know, I talk to you guys fairly often, and you and I know that our schools are grossly underfunded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4443)|
| 1:14:10| We needed a whole lot more money before the pandemic hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4450)|
| 1:14:16| And Mr. Thomas has mentioned, what, $10 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4456)|
| 1:14:20| He's already anticipating spending unbudgeted money, and I don't know where that's going to come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4460)|
| 1:14:27| But I bet you there's probably a lot more that's going to be needed if we're actually going to be able to do school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4467)|
| 1:14:33| in a way that's safe for our children and our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4473)|
| 1:14:38| So, I've been saying, well, gosh, how did we get into this mess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4478)|
| 1:14:42| And, you know, I've come to the conclusion that this entire mess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4482)|
| 1:14:47| is the result of mismanagement by two people in our state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4487)|
| 1:14:54| Well, two people that most affect us, and that's Governor Lee and Mayor Jacobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4494)|
| 1:15:01| because both of those people decided that they were going to open up things back in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4501)|
| 1:15:07| You know, we started to have a little bit of stuff in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4507)|
| 1:15:09| Things were good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4509)|
| 1:15:10| Now we decide to open up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4510)|
| 1:15:12| So this whole problem, you know, now it's exploding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4512)|
| 1:15:15| And if we bring the kids back into school, much as everybody wants it to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4515)|
| 1:15:21| it's hard to imagine it's not going to get even worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4521)|
| 1:15:24| But these people, their decisions, we trusted them to make the decisions for our county and our state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4524)|
| 1:15:32| to do the things that would keep us safe and keep the state working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4532)|
| 1:15:36| They decided to do things against the guidance of the CDC, and now this is where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4536)|
| 1:15:43| So the importance of that is, you know, calling people out when they make a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4543)|
| 1:15:48| You know, my mom has said, when you break it, you fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4548)|
| 1:15:52| So these people that have made these decisions that have put our community, our children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4552)|
| 1:15:58| our families, our economy in this terrible mess, they need to fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4558)|
| 1:16:03| So I'm here to urge you as board members and Mr. Thomas as a superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4563)|
| 1:16:10| to demand the resources you need to do this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4570)|
| 1:16:15| You know, social distancing in a classroom with 28 kids is not social distancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4575)|
| 1:16:21| You know, and masks will help, but we know it's not going to be enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4581)|
| 1:16:26| You need a whole lot more resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4586)|
| 1:16:28| You're going to need people to ask these questions when the people come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4588)|
| 1:16:31| This is not, you know, Mr. Thomas is a very optimistic fellow, very nice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4591)|
| 1:16:36| but, you know, I think at some points I think he's too optimistic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4596)|
| 1:16:41| and isn't really own up to the fact that this is too big for the resources we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4601)|
| 1:16:48| So I'm calling on you to start pushing back at these people and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4608)|
| 1:16:53| you guys made this mess, now help us fix this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4613)|
| 1:16:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4615)|
| 1:17:00| Tanya Coates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4620)|
| 1:17:06| Tanya Coates, Knox County, president of the Knox County Education Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4626)|
| 1:17:11| Thank you, Madam Chair and school board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4631)|
| 1:17:13| What a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4633)|
| 1:17:15| We thought two weeks could not get here quick enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4635)|
| 1:17:18| However, now that this plan has arrived, the reopening of schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4638)|
| 1:17:23| let's get the elephant out in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4643)|
| 1:17:27| This plan took a lot of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4647)|
| 1:17:30| The what ifs, why can't we, how are we, don't you think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4650)|
| 1:17:36| and a few other questions just to add a few starters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4656)|
| 1:17:40| seem to be a never-ending task from day to day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4660)|
| 1:17:44| The major concern with parents as well as educators is wanting to know the guarantee of their safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4664)|
| 1:17:50| and why can't we wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4670)|
| 1:17:54| If you can remember, even though March was just three months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4674)|
| 1:17:58| today seems like those three months ago just seems like it was today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4678)|
| 1:18:03| We, Knox County, included the educators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4683)|
| 1:18:06| knew that all too well that the magnitude of COVID effects to open Knox County schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4686)|
| 1:18:12| was something to be seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4692)|
| 1:18:15| We, public school, public education here in Knox County was and still is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4695)|
| 1:18:23| as a holly highlighting the disparities of inequities for our students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4703)|
| 1:18:29| but also for our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4709)|
| 1:18:32| Many of you may not know that our staff was not prepared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4712)|
| 1:18:35| because they didn't have the resources to educate our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4715)|
| 1:18:40| Many will not like what I have to say at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4720)|
| 1:18:45| We are going to be damned if we do and damned if we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4725)|
| 1:18:50| But we must open schools because, you see, we have the best education commissioner in the White House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4730)|
| 1:18:57| Oh, but let me fix that for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4737)|
| 1:19:00| So much so that we need to help her obtain a permanent vacation in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4740)|
| 1:19:07| Our Constitution says that we must provide a public education to all students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4747)|
| 1:19:13| and she nor anyone else can threaten us with the fact that they're going to remove public funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4753)|
| 1:19:19| of something that we barely get from them, the 8% that I talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4759)|
| 1:19:24| just because we wanted to delay schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4764)|
| 1:19:28| Schools can function as long as we are safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4768)|
| 1:19:33| The superintendent has guaranteed that he is not trying to send students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4773)|
| 1:19:38| nor any of his staff back to die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4778)|
| 1:19:41| But as you heard earlier, we have to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4781)|
| 1:19:45| Our hopes and the necessary non-negotiables that educators are asking is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4785)|
| 1:19:52| you must ensure that we're going to be safe, utilize this social distancing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4792)|
| 1:19:57| must ask people to wear masks, and continue to wash our hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4797)|
| 1:20:03| But we are going to do what's best for all of our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4803)|
| 1:20:06| and knowing that educators will support whatever is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4806)|
| 1:20:10| We, again, just hope that you have our safety in your hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4810)|
| 1:20:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4816)|
| 1:20:21| That concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4821)|
| 1:20:24| Thank you, Ms. Fab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4824)|
| 1:20:25| And now we'll go to questions and comments from the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4825)|
| 1:20:30| I know I made a couple of notes, but go ahead, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4830)|
| 1:20:36| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4836)|
| 1:20:39| We have heard questions about whether we can guarantee that our staff and our students are safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4839)|
| 1:20:47| We have heard that it is sure that there will be deaths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4847)|
| 1:20:54| And with that, with that magnitude,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4854)|
| 1:20:57| no individual should be fully responsible for a plan of that magnitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4857)|
| 1:21:04| As a board with a duty to ensure the management of our local education agency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4864)|
| 1:21:09| we have a duty as a board to take and accept responsibility for this plan or any other plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4869)|
| 1:21:18| Is it possible that there could be unforeseen and unintended consequences?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4878)|
| 1:21:23| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4883)|
| 1:21:24| We all know that, which is why we don't want to be responsible for this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4884)|
| 1:21:31| Hanging our appointed superintendent out alone to be solely, singly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4891)|
| 1:21:35| and individually responsible for a plan should be seen as a dereliction of our basic duty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4895)|
| 1:21:41| to manage and control our public schools established under our jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4901)|
| 1:21:46| And before anybody says that won't happen, we're all for Bob,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4906)|
| 1:21:50| I have already been contacted by several people who were very concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4910)|
| 1:21:54| because they asked board members about the plan and they were told that that decision is Bob's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4914)|
| 1:22:00| We don't have a hand in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4920)|
| 1:22:04| And when those unforeseen circumstances happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4924)|
| 1:22:07| when we have deaths that we are being guaranteed will happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4927)|
| 1:22:14| are we going to step back and say, it's not on me, that was Bob's plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4934)|
| 1:22:21| Or are we going to do our elected duty and take responsibility for whatever is decided for the districts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4941)|
| 1:22:31| We have already hung him out to dry by putting him solely in charge of making sure this plan happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4951)|
| 1:22:42| We have already abandoned him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4962)|
| 1:22:45| And these decisions should never be happening as our decisions or the administration's decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4965)|
| 1:22:55| These should be our decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4975)|
| 1:22:57| We should be working together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4977)|
| 1:22:59| We should all be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4979)|
| 1:23:02| This shouldn't be something that we just sit back and hang out and wait for our superintendent to bring to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4982)|
| 1:23:10| This is all the training on board superintendent relations right here is where it should be happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4990)|
| 1:23:17| And it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4997)|
| 1:23:18| It's not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=4998)|
| 1:23:21| And however much we don't want to be responsible for it, whether we love it or hate it, I don't love it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5001)|
| 1:23:30| whether we love it or hate it, we have a responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5010)|
| 1:23:36| This plan should be on me too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5016)|
| 1:23:41| It should not just be on one individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5021)|
| 1:23:45| The bottom line is that that's just not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5025)|
| 1:23:49| I have a whole pile of questions over here from tons of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5029)|
| 1:23:54| And over and over we have heard that there are more questions than answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5034)|
| 1:24:00| When there are more questions than answers, that is not a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5040)|
| 1:24:05| That's not feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5045)|
| 1:24:07| If there are more questions than answers, we should be working with our superintendent to find answers to those questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5047)|
| 1:24:15| not sitting back and washing our hands of it and letting him take all the heat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5055)|
| 1:24:21| That's not why we're in these chairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5061)|
| 1:24:26| And that's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5066)|
| 1:24:29| Ms. Christine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5069)|
| 1:24:31| Well, first of all, Mr. Thomas, if you feel like we have abandoned you, I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5071)|
| 1:24:38| I mean, I don't know how you feel about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5078)|
| 1:24:40| I don't have a problem voting on this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5080)|
| 1:24:43| I would question, and maybe this is a good question for Mr. Dupler, you know, if we vote on this specific plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5083)|
| 1:24:52| what happens if we need to change something on page 12 or 15 or, I mean, is that something that has to come back to the board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5092)|
| 1:25:03| And I am curious as to what the superintendent's feelings are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5103)|
| 1:25:08| Like I said, I don't have a problem with it, but, you know, we have to have a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5108)|
| 1:25:14| You know, all we have heard is we do not have a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5114)|
| 1:25:17| And I think the worst thing that could happen would be leaving here tonight without a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5117)|
| 1:25:22| or a plan that we didn't all agree on or come to some consensus to, but it has to be something that he can work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5122)|
| 1:25:31| And if he's going to have to be constantly bringing stuff back to us, I just think that would make things very difficult for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5131)|
| 1:25:41| Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5141)|
| 1:25:43| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5143)|
| 1:25:44| Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5144)|
| 1:25:45| Ms. Christie, I think you've put your finger on the number one issue as to why the director of schools has to be somewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5145)|
| 1:25:55| somehow in charge of the plan, you know, because as he said, I mean, this plan is going to likely, more likely than not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5155)|
| 1:26:07| require some type of tweaking, some type of changes as the year goes forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5167)|
| 1:26:13| So he needs to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5173)|
| 1:26:16| If I may, I can make a suggestion that if this board does want to vote on this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5176)|
| 1:26:23| my suggestion would be to leave as part of that motion the director of schools the leeway, you know, the discretion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5183)|
| 1:26:36| to be able to make changes as necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5196)|
| 1:26:39| And then if the board wants to come back and address that at a later date, it can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5199)|
| 1:26:44| But you're exactly correct, which is the board meets once a month to vote, you know, outside of special meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5204)|
| 1:26:52| So it would be unwieldy at best for the board to have to come back and make changes, specific changes to the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5212)|
| 1:27:02| Yeah, we don't have another voting meeting until August 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5222)|
| 1:27:05| So that would be the next opportunity we'd have to vote on a plan if we don't have a resolution this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5225)|
| 1:27:13| So my other question would be to Superintendent Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5233)|
| 1:27:16| Like I said, I don't have a problem voting tonight, but I would kind of like to hear your thoughts on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5236)|
| 1:27:22| I mean, would you feel better about the plan if we did vote on it, or do you think it would be better that we did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5242)|
| 1:27:32| I mean, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5252)|
| 1:27:33| I'm just kind of curious to hear what your thoughts are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5253)|
| 1:27:37| Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5257)|
| 1:27:38| Thank you, Madam Chair, Ms. Christie, to the board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5258)|
| 1:27:45| Mr. Cooper, if you vote on it, please make it so that we do have the authority to make a change, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5265)|
| 1:27:51| without having to have another meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5271)|
| 1:27:55| I was charged with, hey, we've got to develop this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5275)|
| 1:28:00| And, again, like I said a few weeks ago, I work for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5280)|
| 1:28:03| I don't want to get in between board members, some that want not to vote on it, some that want to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5283)|
| 1:28:10| I'm here to do a job, and I'm here for the kids, I'm here for our staff, and I'm here for you to try to do what you want me to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5290)|
| 1:28:19| And this is what we've tried to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5299)|
| 1:28:22| So I guess I'm saying, you know, I'm riding the fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5302)|
| 1:28:26| I'm new to running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5306)|
| 1:28:28| I welcome all the support that you want to give me, but, you know, this is kind of a lonely feeling, I'd say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5308)|
| 1:28:36| being responsible for it all, but that's what you pay me for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5316)|
| 1:28:42| And so I'm basically, I guess I'm saying I'm good either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5322)|
| 1:28:46| So please don't ask me to make the decision for you on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5326)|
| 1:28:50| I've made the decision for you on your plan, if you want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5330)|
| 1:28:55| But if we do vote, you would like for us to have, and maybe if we do, if it does come to a vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5335)|
| 1:29:02| maybe Mr. Dupler could help us with the wording so it is something that you wouldn't have to be constantly bringing back to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5342)|
| 1:29:10| I guess that's my biggest concern with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5350)|
| 1:29:14| And I will certainly keep you informed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5354)|
| 1:29:17| I'm not going to go out there and do anything without, you know, without you knowing about it in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5357)|
| 1:29:22| Thank you, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5362)|
| 1:29:23| Ms. Christie, that was our whole reason, because I felt the superintendent needed flexibility, and he concurred that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5363)|
| 1:29:31| So that's what we went with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5371)|
| 1:29:32| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5372)|
| 1:29:33| Yes, I just want to say that I hope no one thinks that we don't support our superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5373)|
| 1:29:38| I mean, my feeling is we hire our superintendent to make decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5378)|
| 1:29:43| And we have some educators on this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5383)|
| 1:29:45| I am not an educator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5385)|
| 1:29:46| But what I feel like we have done is hired someone to make good decisions for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5386)|
| 1:29:51| and then he has hired people under him, his executive team and Dale Moore, to make this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5391)|
| 1:29:57| And I personally texted with Mr. Thomas today and said, whether we vote on this or not, I support you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5397)|
| 1:30:04| You need to know I support you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5404)|
| 1:30:05| So I've tried to communicate that, and I want him to always know that, you know, I have his back on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5405)|
| 1:30:10| And I do feel like if anybody is worried about it, and if it takes something to show that from the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5410)|
| 1:30:16| but I think that's why we have hired him is to make some of these hard decisions for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5416)|
| 1:30:21| And then he brings them to us and lets us know about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5421)|
| 1:30:24| I'd like to ask a couple of questions, and I don't know who you tell me who the best for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5424)|
| 1:30:31| One of them is a really quick question, is we've got some hard dates in here about deciding on online school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5431)|
| 1:30:37| and this is just being a realtor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5437)|
| 1:30:39| I know a couple of people that are moving here after that date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5439)|
| 1:30:43| Will there be any flexibility on people like that that are actually moving to the district between that hard date and when school starts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5443)|
| 1:30:51| And, again, I'm going to ask John what I would like to do is say yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5451)|
| 1:30:57| I'd like for us to look for ways to say yes more so than we look for ways to say no, and if it's a special circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5457)|
| 1:31:03| And I know our principals and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5463)|
| 1:31:05| Yeah, come on, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5465)|
| 1:31:06| I mean, from the scheduling standpoint, that's part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5466)|
| 1:31:09| We've got to get these schedules built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5469)|
| 1:31:11| We've got to know who the students that are going to go virtual and those that we can plan for to be in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5471)|
| 1:31:18| I think if it's some special circumstances that we can make it happen, I'd like to be able to say, you know, we'll work with you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5478)|
| 1:31:25| But, John, too, you might be able to elaborate more on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5485)|
| 1:31:28| Thank you, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5488)|
| 1:31:29| So I think the reason, as Mr. Thomas said, those dates are set for that is really kind of backward planning for what we need to do for the virtual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5489)|
| 1:31:36| because the way we're set now, August, by knowing that, schools have until August 3rd to build out their virtual schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5496)|
| 1:31:43| And then after that, the ladies we introduced earlier will have to hire a staff or whatever can't be covered in three weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5503)|
| 1:31:51| hire the staff, build the master schedule, and be ready to go by the 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5511)|
| 1:31:54| So that's a pretty tight timeline for that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5514)|
| 1:31:57| So I think your question was around people moving to the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5517)|
| 1:32:01| Yeah, I think it's a small amount of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5521)|
| 1:32:03| Yeah, I think we would treat that totally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5523)|
| 1:32:04| As they came and they registered at their base school, I think, you know, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5524)|
| 1:32:08| it would be a small enough number that we should be able to absorb that when they enroll and let them know both options are available to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5528)|
| 1:32:13| And then I think this other question is for you, too, because we've actually kind of already talked about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5533)|
| 1:32:18| But I've had someone text me while I'm here, and so I think to have that public discussion about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5538)|
| 1:32:23| I think this is a real – I think with elementary school, there's not a lot of choices in classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5543)|
| 1:32:28| But as we get to high school and there is a lot of choice in class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5548)|
| 1:32:31| and I'm specifically hearing from people with IB and AP questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5551)|
| 1:32:36| and I know there's the concern for people that want to choose the online version of the limitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5556)|
| 1:32:45| And I actually texted back to the person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5565)|
| 1:32:49| And my understanding is it's a bit of a catch-22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5569)|
| 1:32:52| Until we really know who wants the classes, it's hard for us to know how many people we can offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5572)|
| 1:32:57| But if you can speak a little bit more of that and the high school selection issue with online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5577)|
| 1:33:02| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5582)|
| 1:33:03| So, you know, where – I know Mr. Thomas covered the caveat for the virtual is, one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5583)|
| 1:33:09| there could be some limitations to the classes, just the sheer numbers of how you do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5589)|
| 1:33:14| So I think everybody's read the plan, but I'll try to clarify some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5594)|
| 1:33:17| So every school, in essence, will be both an on-campus live school but also a virtual school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5597)|
| 1:33:22| And our hope is that the base school and the staff is allotted to that handles the majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5602)|
| 1:33:27| We're throwing a number – 80, 85 percent is what we'd love – within that current staff of that school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5607)|
| 1:33:32| Quest, then, is the next layer of district-wide classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5612)|
| 1:33:36| So say some of those three students who want a German class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5616)|
| 1:33:39| that's not enough for a base teacher to give up a section of that virtually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5619)|
| 1:33:44| So those requests would go up to the Quest school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5624)|
| 1:33:46| and then they would look to see if there's enough requests across the district to create that German class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5626)|
| 1:33:51| and they would create it as that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5631)|
| 1:33:53| So that's how that would work, and that's why there may be some limitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5633)|
| 1:33:56| So every principal may have to collapse some electives in order to be able to produce enough virtual algebra classes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5636)|
| 1:34:03| and live algebra classes at the same time within their current staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5643)|
| 1:34:07| So that could be a limiting factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5647)|
| 1:34:09| IB is unique because it is one school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5649)|
| 1:34:11| The other thing about IB is that the requirements for the certifications to be able to teach that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5651)|
| 1:34:16| there's not a lot of those teachers around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5656)|
| 1:34:18| So we've had a conversation with Ms. Jessie Slash B's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5658)|
| 1:34:22| I'm not sure what she's going by for sure, so I'll say both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5662)|
| 1:34:24| And she understands that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5664)|
| 1:34:27| I mean, she may have to prioritize IB classes for graduation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5667)|
| 1:34:31| because those probably won't be viable classes for the district online| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5671)|
| 1:34:35| and seeing that there won't be other requests from other schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5675)|
| 1:34:38| So she may give us more algebra 2 sections, but save her IB sections there that she would have to cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5678)|
| 1:34:44| So, again, I think there could be limitations if there are small classes that may not actually make in those IB classes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5684)|
| 1:34:49| but she will probably be the one on her staff to be able to make this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5689)|
| 1:34:54| And my guess is that maybe on the AP, this might open up some AP options for kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5694)|
| 1:34:59| that perhaps haven't even had the opportunity for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5699)|
| 1:35:02| Is that a possibility too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5702)|
| 1:35:04| I think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5704)|
| 1:35:05| I think our first priority on all the virtual will be to make sure we're covering graduation requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5705)|
| 1:35:11| I think Mr. Thomas covered that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5711)|
| 1:35:13| And then to see where we go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5713)|
| 1:35:15| We had a good conversation with Dr. Wise from Pellissippi yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5715)|
| 1:35:18| They're going to be, by and large, virtual as well and with online options, asynchronous and synchronous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5718)|
| 1:35:24| And they've shared their catalog with us that we're sharing with our high school counselors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5724)|
| 1:35:27| So I think there will be plenty of opportunities as well to go virtual, dual enrollment for students too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5727)|
| 1:35:32| So we're still trying to think of those advanced students as we think through those programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5732)|
| 1:35:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5737)|
| 1:35:38| Thank you, Mr. Isaac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5738)|
| 1:35:39| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5739)|
| 1:35:40| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5740)|
| 1:35:43| I guess I just have a comment and sort of a semi-question in reference to what you all were talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5743)|
| 1:35:52| Ms. Bam, I guess I'll direct it toward you as a superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5752)|
| 1:36:01| Would it not be reasonable for somebody that moved to town to give them the same option that we're giving everybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5761)|
| 1:36:14| A week to think about which line they want to choose, providing that they could qualify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5774)|
| 1:36:23| That shouldn't pose any problems, should it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5783)|
| 1:36:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5788)|
| 1:36:29| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5789)|
| 1:36:30| Again, if somebody moves into the school zone from out of town, we don't say, I'm sorry, you know, school's full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5790)|
| 1:36:36| You can't come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5796)|
| 1:36:37| So, again, if somebody's moving into town and they want to look at this and make a choice, as John said, I think too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5797)|
| 1:36:44| probably we're not talking about huge numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5804)|
| 1:36:46| So I think we could have an opportunity for situations like that to give parents that choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5806)|
| 1:36:53| Well, you know, since we were doing a week here, that's where the week came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5813)|
| 1:37:00| But, you know, three days, whatever is reasonable, because they'll probably go home and talk about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5820)|
| 1:37:06| and decide they'd probably be ready the next day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5826)|
| 1:37:10| But actually what I wanted to do, I want to make some comments in reference to some things that have been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5830)|
| 1:37:21| Pardon my voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5841)|
| 1:37:24| I want to ask you, Mr. Duper, in reference to these, assuming we did vote, and there was something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5844)|
| 1:37:43| most of these things are going to be the tweaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5863)|
| 1:37:48| Somebody said something about tweaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5868)|
| 1:37:52| They could be handled by the superintendent for the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5872)|
| 1:37:59| And do you think that if it was something that, you know, required more than that, do you think, say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5879)|
| 1:38:19| we had to have a, for some reason, had to have a special meeting of the board in order to deal with whatever we're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5899)|
| 1:38:29| Now, I mean, you know, do you think 72 hours would be reasonable notice for the board to meet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5909)|
| 1:38:41| Or does it need to be, what, four days, four working days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5921)|
| 1:38:47| It can't be too long if it's something that requires the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5927)|
| 1:38:53| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5933)|
| 1:38:54| Mr. McMillan, the board may have a special meeting with 48 hours notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5934)|
| 1:39:01| So the answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5941)|
| 1:39:03| I mean, you know, 72.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5943)|
| 1:39:05| 72 is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5945)|
| 1:39:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5946)|
| 1:39:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5947)|
| 1:39:09| That would kind of take care of the situation there that we were talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5949)|
| 1:39:17| I personally think that the majority of people in Knox County want to open the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5957)|
| 1:39:30| They want traditional schools, I believe, most of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5970)|
| 1:39:41| They're, for the most part, there are no real absolutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5981)|
| 1:39:50| And it's certainly not in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5990)|
| 1:39:53| You know, the old adage, death and taxes are the only absolutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5993)|
| 1:39:59| And nobody wants to see anybody, student or adult, employee or otherwise, parent, whomever, get sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=5999)|
| 1:40:15| But at the same time, we need to do something because I think that it's, from what I'm hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6015)|
| 1:40:26| it's affecting a lot of kids' socialization as well as their academic concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6026)|
| 1:40:38| I think they want to be there with their friends, for the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6038)|
| 1:40:44| Now, I do think that we should make sure, if we do this, make sure that the masking is enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6044)|
| 1:40:56| I agree with the good doctor there that that is an absolute must.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6056)|
| 1:41:02| But from my standpoint, I think Mr. Thomas and his staff have put together what I consider an outstanding plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6062)|
| 1:41:17| I think it covers as many of the bases as you can possibly cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6077)|
| 1:41:26| Now, as he said, Superintendent said earlier, he said he was sure that they'd missed some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6086)|
| 1:41:36| And that can happen to anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6096)|
| 1:41:38| I don't care who you had planning it or what kind of a staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6098)|
| 1:41:45| But it's time that we open the schools in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6105)|
| 1:41:53| If people don't want, if they're fearful, if the adults and employees don't want to work, there's an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6113)|
| 1:42:02| Take a semester off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6122)|
| 1:42:04| Hopefully, maybe they will have some kind of a, you know, vaccination or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6124)|
| 1:42:15| They got all excited this morning on the news that they had found something and that it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6135)|
| 1:42:22| But come to find out, it was going to be way down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6142)|
| 1:42:26| It wasn't going to be available, you know, in a couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6146)|
| 1:42:30| So having said that, to stop rambling, I would like to make a motion that we adopt the superintendent's plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6150)|
| 1:42:46| And that, can we put, Mr. Dupre, can we put the 72 hours or 48 hours notice incorporated in with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6166)|
| 1:43:03| If nobody objects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6183)|
| 1:43:05| Yeah, certainly we can include, or you all can include that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6185)|
| 1:43:09| I think Ms. Owen also had some good language that she and I were discussing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6189)|
| 1:43:16| basically stating that the director of schools would have all the power to make tweaks and amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6196)|
| 1:43:28| that are granted under state law and board policy and practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6208)|
| 1:43:33| So that basically what that would do is he would be able to make changes that I would describe as more minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6213)|
| 1:43:41| But if the plan needs to be radically changed, then that's where your suggestion comes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6221)|
| 1:43:48| which is, you know, a special call board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6228)|
| 1:43:51| That's exactly what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6231)|
| 1:43:54| And in a minute, if one of you all will read those things to make sure that we, or is it a list of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6234)|
| 1:44:06| or do you need to read that into the record or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6246)|
| 1:44:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6254)|
| 1:44:15| I mean, I would suggest that one of the board members make such a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6255)|
| 1:44:19| and Ms. Owen, I'll leave it to her to be recognized and, you know, see if she would do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6259)|
| 1:44:25| but perhaps add the 72 hours that Mr. McMillan is talking about as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6265)|
| 1:44:30| Will that 72 hours limit any ability, as I have it worded now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6270)|
| 1:44:37| It would not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6277)|
| 1:44:39| I think what he's saying is that. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6279)|
| 1:44:42| That would be the soonest that you could have for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6282)|
| 1:44:46| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6286)|
| 1:44:47| I mean, the board policy talks about 48 hours, but, you know, that's not always practical either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6287)|
| 1:44:54| I mean, you know, if something comes up with this particular thing, I think he was saying, you know, try to shoot for 72.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6294)|
| 1:45:00| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6300)|
| 1:45:01| I would think 72 would take care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6301)|
| 1:45:05| And what I'm trying to do is establish some potential degree of what we used to refer to as normalcy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6305)|
| 1:45:27| It's not going to be normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6327)|
| 1:45:29| It won't be for a long, long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6329)|
| 1:45:32| But if we can open schools, have the majority of kids and teachers working,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6332)|
| 1:45:41| and not only teachers, but we've got a lot of other staff, if we can have those people working safely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6341)|
| 1:45:51| then I think we as a board and the superintendent, who, by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6351)|
| 1:45:57| I don't think there's anybody sitting around this table that does not support our superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6357)|
| 1:46:05| And, again, I want to say that I think you and the staff did an excellent job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6365)|
| 1:46:12| So I would put that in a form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6372)|
| 1:46:15| Mr. McMillan, before you make a motion, would you mind if we have more questions from the board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6375)|
| 1:46:20| Would you mind if we get some more feedback from staff before we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6380)|
| 1:46:26| Well, I don't really mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6386)|
| 1:46:29| But usually the way we do it is we put a motion on the floor and then questions and comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6389)|
| 1:46:38| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6398)|
| 1:46:39| That doesn't, until you take the vote, it doesn't, you know, it doesn't impact anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6399)|
| 1:46:45| Okay. So would you repeat your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6405)|
| 1:46:48| It is basically to adopt the plan that the superintendent has come forward with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6408)|
| 1:46:58| and include a 72-hour notice if board members or the superintendent feel like we need a special call meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6418)|
| 1:47:15| that it's not something that the superintendent could handle as a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6435)|
| 1:47:27| what we might classify as not impacting a large number of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6447)|
| 1:47:39| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6459)|
| 1:47:46| We have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6466)|
| 1:47:48| I'll be glad to second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6468)|
| 1:47:50| Okay. Mr. Norman is seconding that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6470)|
| 1:47:52| Ms. Owen, do you have a friendly amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6472)|
| 1:47:55| Yes, either a friendly amendment or a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6475)|
| 1:47:58| To adopt the reopening plan with flexibility for the superintendent to make the same kinds of changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6478)|
| 1:48:04| and daily management decisions that are within the duties and responsibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6484)|
| 1:48:08| normally afforded to the superintendent in state law or policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6488)|
| 1:48:12| and the policies and procedures of all our governing entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6492)|
| 1:48:16| Changes determined to be major in nature by the law director, the board of education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6496)|
| 1:48:21| or the superintendent should be addressed in a properly noticed meeting with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6501)|
| 1:48:28| and I would like to say 48 to 72 hours notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6508)|
| 1:48:32| so that it can be somewhat consistent with the policy we already have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6512)|
| 1:48:38| Okay. And you're fine with that, Ms. Jones-Millan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6518)|
| 1:48:40| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6520)|
| 1:48:41| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6521)|
| 1:48:43| Second to sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6523)|
| 1:48:44| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6524)|
| 1:48:45| Okay. So we still have additional questions regarding the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6525)|
| 1:48:49| so we'll come back to voting momentarily. Is that all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6529)|
| 1:48:54| Okay. Ms. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6534)|
| 1:48:56| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6536)|
| 1:49:03| And this really is not so much addressing the motion as it is just still the general discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6543)|
| 1:49:09| that we were having after the plan was presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6549)|
| 1:49:16| I have a couple of questions actually on the virtual school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6556)|
| 1:49:21| Mr. Thomas, who should those be directed to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6561)|
| 1:49:25| Dr. Eisenwick, if it needs further direction, I'll let him direct down the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6565)|
| 1:49:31| But John is very talented. He can probably field them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6571)|
| 1:49:34| I don't know about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6574)|
| 1:49:36| Thank you, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6576)|
| 1:49:40| The concern that I have heard from a few people in this virtual school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6580)|
| 1:49:47| which I support, by the way, absolutely I support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6587)|
| 1:49:51| is that this has the potential of throwing our high schools into a great deal of turmoil for a week or two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6591)|
| 1:50:03| as these schedules that have already been made for students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6603)|
| 1:50:12| these guidance counselors have worked their tails off, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6612)|
| 1:50:17| And then to be told at the last minute that you can't teach this then or we need to swap that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6617)|
| 1:50:25| I guess I'm looking for assurances, if they're available, that the high school schedule will be the first priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6625)|
| 1:50:35| However, the classes are offered and taught,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6635)|
| 1:50:39| and the burden of filling the blanks will, in fact, fall to our virtual school staff that has been in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6639)|
| 1:50:51| Thank you, Ms. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6651)|
| 1:50:52| So, again, to try to continue to provide clarification, the virtual program, I know it's semantics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6652)|
| 1:51:00| but there are some things behind that, is actually not a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6660)|
| 1:51:03| We left it as a program intentionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6663)|
| 1:51:06| What we didn't want to do is have students have to unenroll from their base high school to receive the virtual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6666)|
| 1:51:11| So what we do, in essence, again, is it's really, I would say, first of all, acknowledge that, yes, it is inconvenient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6671)|
| 1:51:17| terribly inconvenient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6677)|
| 1:51:18| I build a lot of master schedules when I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6678)|
| 1:51:21| But at the same time, without occurring extreme costs by duplicating staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6681)|
| 1:51:26| we wanted to make sure we were utilizing the staff we had at the base school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6686)|
| 1:51:29| So everybody's base enrollment is how they're staffed, as you guys know, at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6689)|
| 1:51:35| So they're still serving that same number of kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6695)|
| 1:51:37| It's just a matter of trying to figure out how many now have a V option or a virtual option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6697)|
| 1:51:41| and how many are going to be live and on campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6701)|
| 1:51:44| So that is a reshuffle in the schedule because when they made these schedules in the spring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6704)|
| 1:51:47| they made it with the assumption that all students would be showing up every day to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6707)|
| 1:51:51| So outside of, you know, again, hiring a tremendous amount of staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6711)|
| 1:51:55| and the existing classes not being full because kids would be in virtual schools at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6715)|
| 1:52:01| it could cost probably millions of dollars to replicate at that level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6721)|
| 1:52:04| So what we've asked them to do is go back as these families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6724)|
| 1:52:07| and that's why it's critical that the 15th through the 22nd is that window| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6727)|
| 1:52:11| so that the counselors and principals have the time to build that out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6731)|
| 1:52:15| and to look at what their requests are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6735)|
| 1:52:17| So in essence, they're going back to what they did in the spring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6737)|
| 1:52:19| and now they're looking at the new student requests that now have a virtual and online| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6739)|
| 1:52:24| and building those courses from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6744)|
| 1:52:26| So, again, we still feel it's best that it's the teachers in the base school that they have for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6746)|
| 1:52:31| and then Quest would be the part where they can't give up a section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6751)|
| 1:52:36| that they would then look and try to make that across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6756)|
| 1:52:38| So it isn't convenient, but it is also probably the two challenges we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6758)|
| 1:52:44| is one, hiring that number of teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6764)|
| 1:52:46| And we were looking initially at if all 11,956 that said that they wanted some virtual option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6766)|
| 1:52:53| in our initial survey, if they all did that and 80% of those were covered at the base school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6773)|
| 1:52:58| we still would be talking about 107 new teachers we would have to hire for the virtual school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6778)|
| 1:53:02| So you see how those costs get extremely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6782)|
| 1:53:04| So there really wasn't a better option but then to go back to the base schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6784)|
| 1:53:08| and ask them to try to work their staff to meet the needs of their students on the virtual end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6788)|
| 1:53:13| Again, inconvenient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6793)|
| 1:53:15| We totally understand, and I think I support the superintendent on the five days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6795)|
| 1:53:19| that allow that to move back a little bit to give us a little more time to get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6799)|
| 1:53:22| But it is inconvenient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6802)|
| 1:53:25| Will we be simulcasting some schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6805)|
| 1:53:29| So the plan will be, again, thinking through a student, a student at Carnes High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6809)|
| 1:53:36| who chooses virtual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6816)|
| 1:53:38| Our hope is that Mr. Quorum there, the principal, will be able to look at the student schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6818)|
| 1:53:43| So as those are coming up in real time, which started today I think around noon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6823)|
| 1:53:46| they'll start getting the names of those students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6826)|
| 1:53:48| They don't have to wait until the 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6828)|
| 1:53:50| They could start pulling those schedules and thinking about, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6830)|
| 1:53:53| I need an extra section of English 1 or something, so I'll need a virtual section of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6833)|
| 1:53:57| So they'd look in their master schedule and see where they could collapse a class that exists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6837)|
| 1:54:01| by going through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6841)|
| 1:54:02| So ideally then, so say Mr. Quorum is able to provide the student's first block class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6842)|
| 1:54:07| second block class, and then he's stuck on third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6847)|
| 1:54:10| He can't give that section up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6850)|
| 1:54:12| He would make that request to the ladies that got introduced earlier today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6852)|
| 1:54:15| and then they would look to say, okay, there's seven kids we need for this kind of class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6855)|
| 1:54:19| They'd look around the district to see if there was enough to hire a teacher for that section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6859)|
| 1:54:23| and that would not be a Carnes High School teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6863)|
| 1:54:25| That would be a different teacher teaching under our Quest program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6865)|
| 1:54:28| And so the student wouldn't necessarily feel the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6868)|
| 1:54:31| They would have Carnes teacher virtually period one, period two, period three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6871)|
| 1:54:34| They would have Quest teacher, but they'd still be doing it from home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6874)|
| 1:54:37| And then fourth period they may come back to a class they would have with a Carnes virtual teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6877)|
| 1:54:41| So that's the idea of how it would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6881)|
| 1:54:44| And Quest then is just the following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6884)|
| 1:54:46| It's kind of complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6886)|
| 1:54:47| I get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6887)|
| 1:54:48| It could be a real headache, I hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6888)|
| 1:54:50| It could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6890)|
| 1:54:51| But I applaud the effort that is going into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6891)|
| 1:54:56| What about our students that are in a lot of our CTE classes where hands-on is required?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6896)|
| 1:55:07| What are we doing with those students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6907)|
| 1:55:09| So Dr. Wilson, who I think has stepped out, was here earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6909)|
| 1:55:13| He and his team have been looking at what offerings in CTE are currently at every high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6913)|
| 1:55:18| and then they're going to make recommendations next week to the high schools what programs make sense virtually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6918)|
| 1:55:25| and what programs are going to be more for the ones that need to be on campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6925)|
| 1:55:28| So obviously like a welding is not something you're going to be able to duplicate in a virtual setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6928)|
| 1:55:33| But there are some business classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6933)|
| 1:55:35| I know they have some health science, some veins of a health science program that could be done that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6935)|
| 1:55:40| So they're right now evaluating those and then trying to let the principals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6940)|
| 1:55:43| and counselors know with what you offer here are programs that could be done that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6943)|
| 1:55:48| Ideally, we would bring them on campus a few days a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6948)|
| 1:55:51| I think under the current situation that could be difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6951)|
| 1:55:56| Transportation costs, again, to run buses every period, that sort of thing, will get extremely expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6956)|
| 1:56:01| So, again, there are some limitations to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6961)|
| 1:56:03| We know that's not ideal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6963)|
| 1:56:05| But our hope would be then to plug them into programs that make sense virtually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6965)|
| 1:56:09| that may not have been their first choice, what they picked in the spring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6969)|
| 1:56:12| but would still help them for their graduation requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6972)|
| 1:56:15| I would hope that you would look at situations where some of our kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6975)|
| 1:56:21| especially with the hands-on, the welding, electronics, this kind of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6981)|
| 1:56:26| that have to have the hands-on, that are opting for virtual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6986)|
| 1:56:30| that if there would be any possible way to give them an option for that class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6990)|
| 1:56:39| even if it means transporting themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=6999)|
| 1:56:43| Just don't close that door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7003)|
| 1:56:46| Don't close that door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7006)|
| 1:56:47| If we've got a kid who's a senior who needs that to get his welding certification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7007)|
| 1:56:54| and he can drive to do it, you know what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7014)|
| 1:56:58| I hope that we'll have some leeway in those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7018)|
| 1:57:03| So I would say two things to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7023)|
| 1:57:05| The first, you know, the reason it would be hard for us to offer that district-wide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7025)|
| 1:57:09| would be, again, transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7029)|
| 1:57:11| We can't provide for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7031)|
| 1:57:12| But we have, because I've been asked some other questions, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7032)|
| 1:57:14| We did, as Mr. Thomas said earlier, tell principals, we want to try to say yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7034)|
| 1:57:18| So if you've thought of ways to do those kinds of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7038)|
| 1:57:21| and kind of worked out some of those one-offs that make sense for the family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7041)|
| 1:57:25| in a graduation situation, I think we would try everything we could to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7045)|
| 1:57:29| And then one other option we have, again, talking with Dr. Wise at Pellissippi,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7049)|
| 1:57:33| what we understand is the majority of the classes they're going to do in person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7053)|
| 1:57:37| they're only going to probably offer around 10% to 15% of those on campus this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7057)|
| 1:57:41| or this semester, but they are going to be a lot of the CTE classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7061)|
| 1:57:45| So there may be some opportunities for dual enrollment that wouldn't be our teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7065)|
| 1:57:48| but the student could enroll with a Pellissippi teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7068)|
| 1:57:51| and maybe finish that program of study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7071)|
| 1:57:53| So we've thought through some of those as options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7073)|
| 1:57:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7076)|
| 1:58:01| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7081)|
| 1:58:02| As far as virtual goes, I read in the guidelines where students that are doing virtual learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7082)|
| 1:58:09| will be able to participate in any extracurricular activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7089)|
| 1:58:15| and after-hour activities that are going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7095)|
| 1:58:19| It reminds me of a comment my pastor made about don't tell me that you can't come to church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7099)|
| 1:58:28| because you're afraid of COVID and the exposure and let me run into you in Walmart the next day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7108)|
| 1:58:36| So I'm kind of curious about that decision being made about students electing to do virtual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7116)|
| 1:58:46| but still can participate in everything else going on outside of the school day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7126)|
| 1:58:53| I think you make a good point, and I think most families who are choosing it for that safety reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7133)|
| 1:58:59| I would anticipate that they will choose not to participate in those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7139)|
| 1:59:06| But thinking outside of things like sports and robotics teams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7146)|
| 1:59:09| and there are a lot of other things that we do extracurricular-wise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7149)|
| 1:59:13| that may have some limits in social distancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7153)|
| 1:59:15| We may be able to do some more social distancing or may be safer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7155)|
| 1:59:18| Again, we felt like one of our goals was try to make things feel as normal as they usually do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7158)|
| 1:59:24| I get the thought on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7164)|
| 1:59:28| The irony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7168)|
| 1:59:29| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7169)|
| 1:59:30| There's a lot of irony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7170)|
| 1:59:31| My high school grandson is thinking, you mean I can stay home and do all my classes but I can still go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7171)|
| 1:59:35| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7175)|
| 1:59:36| Basketball practice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7176)|
| 1:59:37| I mean, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7177)|
| 1:59:39| I think there may be folks for various reasons, and I think Mr. Thomas alluded to this earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7179)|
| 1:59:47| We think this is just the start of what virtual can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7187)|
| 1:59:50| We think that some families will choose this because they would have chosen it without COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7190)|
| 1:59:54| And so I think some of those may be in that situation where they still want the social interaction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7194)|
| 1:59:58| but maybe the health concern is not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7198)|
| 2:00:00| But it makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7200)|
| 2:00:02| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7202)|
| 2:00:05| This question is for Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7205)|
| 2:00:07| The days that we're front-loading on the calendar for our increment weather days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7207)|
| 2:00:16| and then I believe you also said there's going to be a couple of in-service days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7216)|
| 2:00:21| that would have been scheduled later in the year that are being moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7221)|
| 2:00:26| We've left those intact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7226)|
| 2:00:28| Initially, that's what we were talking about, and that was before we understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7228)|
| 2:00:33| Once we found out Clarksville, Montgomery got a waiver to move those increment weather days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7233)|
| 2:00:38| then that took the pressure off in trying to reschedule some of the other days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7238)|
| 2:00:42| So the calendar basically is still intact like it was with in-service days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7242)|
| 2:00:48| The whole year is still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7248)|
| 2:00:50| Oh, excellent, excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7250)|
| 2:00:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7252)|
| 2:00:56| As a comment, Mr. Thomas, I really do hear the recommendations about the masks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7256)|
| 2:01:08| and hope that you will strongly, strongly go beyond the mask mandatory except for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7268)|
| 2:01:20| and require masks just because if this is going to be our new norm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7280)|
| 2:01:32| I think that rather than getting in the take them off, take them on, put them on all day, every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7292)|
| 2:01:40| even myself I find I will walk in somewhere without one because I'm so taking it on and off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7300)|
| 2:01:48| I hope that your staff will relook at that and making that an absolute in this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7308)|
| 2:01:56| but that's just a comment from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7316)|
| 2:02:01| And in closing, I know everybody on this board has gotten hundreds of emails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7321)|
| 2:02:08| and requests have been all over the place from, you know, pushing start date back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7328)|
| 2:02:16| Labor Day, or doing staggered starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7336)|
| 2:02:21| We've all heard about everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7341)|
| 2:02:25| I want to reiterate, though, that we are offering choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7345)|
| 2:02:34| And honest to goodness, in this time and what we're faced with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7354)|
| 2:02:38| I really genuinely believe that our KCS leadership has done a wonderful job and put those choices out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7358)|
| 2:02:49| So if you are a family that believes that this is not the right thing for you to send your children back to school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7369)|
| 2:02:57| no one is telling you that you have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7377)|
| 2:03:01| You have that choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7381)|
| 2:03:04| And so I just encourage every family to make it a matter of a family meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7384)|
| 2:03:10| make it a matter of prayer in your family if you are a praying family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7390)|
| 2:03:16| Search out what the best of maybe even bad options are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7396)|
| 2:03:21| and then embrace it and encourage your children to embrace it also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7401)|
| 2:03:30| These are just unprecedented times, and respecting all of the very serious health hazards that are out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7410)|
| 2:03:40| you do have a choice not to send your child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7420)|
| 2:03:44| So I applaud you and your staff for what you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7424)|
| 2:03:49| Thank you, Ms. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7429)|
| 2:03:51| Ms. Babb, did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7431)|
| 2:03:53| I do, but if you have a question, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7433)|
| 2:03:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7435)|
| 2:03:56| Well, a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7436)|
| 2:03:58| I just wanted to also applaud the superintendent and the executive team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7438)|
| 2:04:02| They have spent countless hours, countless hours working on this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7442)|
| 2:04:07| and the level of detail in the plan is impressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7447)|
| 2:04:11| And so I appreciate all that time that you've all spent working on this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7451)|
| 2:04:16| I have a couple of questions that, one, to go back to what virtual school would look like, particularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7456)|
| 2:04:25| You talked about high school, but if Shannon or John, one of you could talk about elementary school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7465)|
| 2:04:30| and particularly I've heard from some kindergarten families who are very concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7470)|
| 2:04:37| So if you could speak to those, that would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7477)|
| 2:04:40| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7480)|
| 2:04:42| We just spend a lot of time thinking about our youngest learners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7482)|
| 2:04:45| and really thinking about this on the continuum of what does a 5-year-old need that's different from an 18-year-old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7485)|
| 2:04:51| They're very different needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7491)|
| 2:04:53| There is a policy that the state board has put out that requires that kindergartners are participating in school for 4 hours a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7493)|
| 2:05:01| even if they're virtual, and are through first grade through 12th grade must be engaged for 6 1⁄2 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7501)|
| 2:05:08| However, that doesn't all have to be synchronous learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7508)|
| 2:05:11| We are able to structure that so that we will have certified kindergarten teachers who know kindergarten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7511)|
| 2:05:19| who will be thinking through what does that look like for the student to do online, engaged with a teacher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7519)|
| 2:05:25| and then have frequent times for them to be offline and doing work independently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7525)|
| 2:05:30| and engaging in some age-appropriate work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7530)|
| 2:05:35| We know they need breaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7535)|
| 2:05:36| We know they need recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7536)|
| 2:05:38| All those things are important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7538)|
| 2:05:40| We agree that ideally we would have our youngest kids in the classrooms working with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7540)|
| 2:05:44| but because of COVID, we are having to think through these other options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7544)|
| 2:05:48| and live within the constraints of that state board policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7548)|
| 2:05:52| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7552)|
| 2:05:54| Does anybody have any questions on that particular topic while she's here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7554)|
| 2:05:57| Okay, thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7557)|
| 2:05:59| Okay, the other question that I had, I would like to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7559)|
| 2:06:03| I know that Mr. Myers and I think Dr. Reislich or somebody else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7563)|
| 2:06:07| has been really spending a lot of time with Dr. Buchanan from the Health Department recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7567)|
| 2:06:12| So, Jason, if you would come and if you could talk about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7572)|
| 2:06:16| and then also if you could talk about the, I think you have additional information going out to special education families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7576)|
| 2:06:24| So, if you could speak to both of those topics, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7584)|
| 2:06:26| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7586)|
| 2:06:27| Yeah, our relationship with the Health Department has been incredibly valuable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7587)|
| 2:06:32| and it's been in place long before we had COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7592)|
| 2:06:35| Prior to the onset of all this, we were already meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7595)|
| 2:06:38| my team was already meeting monthly with the team at the Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7598)|
| 2:06:42| So, it's a very important and valuable partnership for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7602)|
| 2:06:45| I can't thank Dr. Buchanan and Charity Menifee enough for their willingness to really just open door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7605)|
| 2:06:54| I mean, we've gone through periods where we've talked daily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7614)|
| 2:06:58| and in the last few weeks we've had scheduled formal meetings with Dr. Buchanan, Charity Menifee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7618)|
| 2:07:04| myself, Dr. Reislich, and Lisa Wagner, our nursing supervisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7624)|
| 2:07:10| So, we've really been in pretty constant contact with them as it relates to any recommendations about the contact tracing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7630)|
| 2:07:17| our protocols for entering school, temperature checks, screenings, all those pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7637)|
| 2:07:22| We've worked hand-in-hand with our Health Department in those recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7642)|
| 2:07:27| In fact, we met with them as recently as yesterday to review the draft one final time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7647)|
| 2:07:32| made some adjustments to the language of the mask protocol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7652)|
| 2:07:37| And, you know, in our minds, you know, I hear what's being said, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7657)|
| 2:07:42| How much can we really socially distance in a classroom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7662)|
| 2:07:46| And I think the language of requiring the mask in that circumstance does really essentially make the mask a mandate, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7666)|
| 2:07:53| Like, we've been in our classrooms, and I hear our teachers and the gentleman who spoke earlier, and he's correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7673)|
| 2:07:59| and that's why we're saying that masks are a requirement when we don't have the capacity to socially distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7679)|
| 2:08:06| And so we, you know, we worked really hard on trying to get that language right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7686)|
| 2:08:11| But, yeah, we've been in contact with the Health Department and their team constantly throughout all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7691)|
| 2:08:17| And, again, we have a really sound protocol in place as it relates to the contact tracing for when school does begin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7697)|
| 2:08:23| And, of course, currently we're already have students engaging in extracurriculars and various other activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7703)|
| 2:08:29| So we're watching that machine and that protocol work now before we actually have, you know, full start of school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7709)|
| 2:08:38| So, again, couldn't be more thankful for the partnership with our folks at the Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7718)|
| 2:08:45| The second question had to do with the additional messaging we were going to send to our families who have children with disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7725)|
| 2:08:52| And I know that, you know, there's been some frustration with families, you know, waiting for that specific communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7732)|
| 2:09:02| And what I'll say is in my measure and as I approach operations and student supports, children with disabilities are children first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7742)|
| 2:09:11| And it was important for us to have a comprehensive plan that kept the needs of all of our students in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7751)|
| 2:09:17| And it is the job of the Student Supports Department to come in and make sure that our children with disabilities, our ELs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7757)|
| 2:09:23| kids who are served under Section 504, and the students with additional health needs, then we come in and we plan for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7763)|
| 2:09:30| and make sure that they can access whatever it is that we've designed for all students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7770)|
| 2:09:34| So, to me, that's how our department is supposed to work in serving children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7774)|
| 2:09:39| So, it was important that we sent out our messaging behind the message for, you know, for the entire district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7779)|
| 2:09:48| I believe my message went out to families at about 6 o'clock to discuss some of the service options that would be available to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7788)|
| 2:09:55| if they chose to go virtual and also gave them points of contact so that if they wanted more information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7795)|
| 2:10:03| schedule IEP meetings, whatever the case may be, they'll have that option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7803)|
| 2:10:07| But, you know, I believed it was important for us to get the plan for all children and then explain how Student Supports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7807)|
| 2:10:14| will make sure that students can access it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7814)|
| 2:10:17| Thank you. That makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7817)|
| 2:10:19| All right. Thank you, Mr. Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7819)|
| 2:10:20| Any questions for Jason on these two topics?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7820)|
| 2:10:23| I have some concerns that some special ed parents have addressed with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7823)|
| 2:10:28| And I did sit in on one of those meetings that they had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7828)|
| 2:10:31| The first thing that they have said is that they do feel like they are being heard by you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7831)|
| 2:10:35| They feel like you are listening and taking their concerns very seriously, and they appreciate that very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7835)|
| 2:10:41| They feel like that has not always been the case, and they appreciate that they are beginning to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7841)|
| 2:10:48| I think I'm just going to fly through these, and then if you want to address any of them, maybe that would be the best way to go about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7848)|
| 2:10:55| As we've already heard, our parents of special needs students were concerned that there was not a focus group for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7855)|
| 2:11:04| And so they made their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7864)|
| 2:11:06| And they have been meeting regularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7866)|
| 2:11:08| They have brought in legislators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7868)|
| 2:11:11| I went to one of those and not been able to be to another one since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7871)|
| 2:11:17| But they've had some very deep and very honest conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7877)|
| 2:11:22| They feel like their students are being put behind everyone else as far as planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7882)|
| 2:11:28| And I tried to assure them that it is happening simultaneously, even though they don't necessarily see that happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7888)|
| 2:11:35| They have a large concern that their students are currently missing their adaptive therapies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7895)|
| 2:11:40| and that they will fall behind where they were when we left school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7900)|
| 2:11:48| They feel that they need appropriate adaptive equipment from day one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7908)|
| 2:11:53| And so they want to know how they can ensure whatever is needed, whatever laptop version they need, whatever is going to fit their IEP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7913)|
| 2:12:04| They don't want it to happen down the road after school starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7924)|
| 2:12:07| They want to be sure that that can happen day one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7927)|
| 2:12:10| They feel like there needs to be some kind of baseline that is communicated for how we are going to meet their needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7930)|
| 2:12:19| And I'm not sure exactly what that would entail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7939)|
| 2:12:23| And I'm not sure that anyone is sure what it entails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7943)|
| 2:12:27| But basically the idea was tell us how you plan to meet our needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7947)|
| 2:12:33| What is that baseline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7953)|
| 2:12:35| What do we need to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7955)|
| 2:12:37| What do you need to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7957)|
| 2:12:38| What should we expect, basically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7958)|
| 2:12:40| And it sounds like you are starting to communicate that already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7960)|
| 2:12:44| I think you have already addressed the communication issue that has happened in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7964)|
| 2:12:51| One parent noted that she was getting multiple texts and phone calls and communications from school for her student who is a general education student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7971)|
| 2:13:02| But her student who was in special education services, she did not have any communication at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7982)|
| 2:13:07| And I wrote down a couple things that some parents in those meetings have said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7987)|
| 2:13:12| She said, we have every reason to feel like they have forgotten our kids because they always forget our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7992)|
| 2:13:19| That was pretty heartbreaking to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=7999)|
| 2:13:22| She said, just send me an email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8002)|
| 2:13:25| And I think all our parents feel this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8005)|
| 2:13:27| Just send me one email to let me know you're working on it and that I haven't been forgotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8007)|
| 2:13:36| And I think that's the majority of their concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8016)|
| 2:13:40| It was largely about communication and about finding out how their needs are going to be met and what they need to do to make sure those needs are met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8020)|
| 2:13:49| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8029)|
| 2:13:50| So I'll take a stab at addressing a few of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8030)|
| 2:13:52| There were a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8032)|
| 2:13:53| I didn't want to jump in while you were going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8033)|
| 2:13:55| But, yeah, that baseline kind of information that they're seeking is going to be part of that email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8035)|
| 2:14:01| And certainly, you know, as we are bringing back our extended contract folks and things, I mean, just like school principals are looking to see who's registering for online, we're going to be doing the same thing in our department, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8041)|
| 2:14:13| So in terms of people who need additional, you know, where there's an augmented device or a completely different device than the Chromebook, we're going to have people in place to help support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8053)|
| 2:14:25| And our goal is absolutely the same as theirs, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8065)|
| 2:14:29| If you choose that virtual option, we want to make sure we have everything in place so that those kids can start on time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8069)|
| 2:14:35| In terms of the communication, you know, I want to give my case manager and our teachers a shout-out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8075)|
| 2:14:41| I mean, nothing's ever going to be perfect, but I know because we kept the data, we made over 19,000 individual contacts with our families during the school closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8081)|
| 2:14:53| So I'm pretty proud of that, and, man, I hope I can have the opportunity to talk to the family who said they didn't hear from someone, because I would definitely like to dig into that a bit more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8093)|
| 2:15:03| because I know that our team was really getting after it, trying to make those contacts and trying to keep up as best as they could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8103)|
| 2:15:11| Also, you know, in terms of that parallel planning, as we were putting together the plan, our department was involved in every single step of the way, whether it was me personally or our program supervisors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8111)|
| 2:15:27| There's not a document that's been shared online or here tonight where student supports wasn't actively involved in advocating for those families and for those kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8127)|
| 2:15:38| And then the last thing that I will take a stab at addressing is I do know that there was some disappointment that there wasn't a specific focus group to address our children with disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8138)|
| 2:15:49| However, we did have families who had children with disabilities that were on the family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8149)|
| 2:15:54| We're part of the family focus group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8154)|
| 2:15:56| So, you know, we tried to hit all the avenues that we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8156)|
| 2:16:02| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8162)|
| 2:16:04| Any other questions on these two topics?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8164)|
| 2:16:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8167)|
| 2:16:08| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8168)|
| 2:16:09| Ms. Babb, I think you were next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8169)|
| 2:16:10| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8170)|
| 2:16:11| And I just want to say, kind of forwarding on this, but not really a question for Mr. Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8171)|
| 2:16:16| I mean, I appreciate Ms. Bush coming and talking about the concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8176)|
| 2:16:20| And I do think sometimes people don't think we think about our kids with IEPs and 504s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8180)|
| 2:16:24| And I think sometimes we don't publicly ask the questions because they're such unique situations that it's hard for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8184)|
| 2:16:30| But I know Jason can attest to the fact that I have emailed him and texted him many times during this period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8190)|
| 2:16:36| So I do want everyone to know, I don't think me alone, I think everybody on our board cares about all of our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8196)|
| 2:16:42| And I just want to reiterate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8202)|
| 2:16:44| And I appreciate Ms. Bush, you know, speaking on behalf of that population of students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8204)|
| 2:16:49| I do have one question, and I do think so much of this is high school, and I think, Mr. Reiswick, this is probably going to be directed for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8209)|
| 2:16:55| And it kind of comes back to sort of the CTE question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8215)|
| 2:16:58| I'm getting from some of my parents that probably want to do the virtual, but their kid is in a very specific thing, like a choral group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8218)|
| 2:17:07| and they're getting to senior year, maybe even trying to get scholarships and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8227)|
| 2:17:11| Do we think there's the opportunity, if there's not the virtual option of something, if there's something very unique,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8231)|
| 2:17:17| that the child might be able to come for maybe one period to participate in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8237)|
| 2:17:23| And I know it might be on a very one-to-one basis, but I do think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8243)|
| 2:17:27| especially some of these junior seniors that are really working to their college resumes, it will be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8247)|
| 2:17:32| So thank you, Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8252)|
| 2:17:35| So I hesitate a little bit to, like, stand here tonight and say yes, because 90 principals will kill me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8255)|
| 2:17:42| I don't want that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8262)|
| 2:17:43| So I do think, again, what we said to them, to the principals, were if they – because they were asking – some people asked for some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8263)|
| 2:17:52| You know, we had some people that said, if a student's quarantined and we don't want to move them over to virtual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8272)|
| 2:17:56| and a teacher's willing to teach them why they do a hybrid class, and we're like, you know, the district is not asking a teacher to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8276)|
| 2:18:02| If a teacher comes to you and you work that out and you want to then have a conversation, let your grade-level director know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8282)|
| 2:18:08| and, you know, we'll work through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8288)|
| 2:18:09| So I think this is the same kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8289)|
| 2:18:11| To me, you know, we want to be fair and equitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8291)|
| 2:18:14| So we understand that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8294)|
| 2:18:16| If we do certain things, then we're going to have people saying, how come this person got to do it and I didn't get to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8296)|
| 2:18:21| But we also don't want to take that out of principals' hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8301)|
| 2:18:23| I mean, they know they're on the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8303)|
| 2:18:25| The teachers are on the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8305)|
| 2:18:26| What we've asked is they not ask people to do things that they're not comfortable with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8306)|
| 2:18:30| because it was very clear from the task force that teaching hybrid as well as, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8310)|
| 2:18:34| teaching a class in a lab and virtual at the same time is very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8314)|
| 2:18:38| So that was not part of our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8318)|
| 2:18:40| So to me, it would be more, you know, rare cases where that could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8320)|
| 2:18:44| But we would leave that discretion up to principals, you know, discussing if we could make those things happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8324)|
| 2:18:49| And I know that may just open the floodgate, and I don't want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8329)|
| 2:18:51| Will, and I'm not – and once again, I do think it has ultimately got to be up to the principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8331)|
| 2:18:56| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8336)|
| 2:18:57| They are running their building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8337)|
| 2:18:58| They are going to be the best ones to know what their needs are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8338)|
| 2:19:01| So I guess kind of – and it kind of gets back to the IEP sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8341)|
| 2:19:04| It's like for these unique one-off situations, is the best route right now, emailing the principal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8344)|
| 2:19:11| Yeah, I would say –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8351)|
| 2:19:13| Once again, I'm not trying to floodgate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8353)|
| 2:19:15| No, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8355)|
| 2:19:16| I mean, and I'm trying to be cognizant of what they might be thinking, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8356)|
| 2:19:21| So I do think, too, there are a lot of factors that may go into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8361)|
| 2:19:25| And just to give them some space to think through that, they may be in a community where, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8365)|
| 2:19:31| with people coming on to campus and off campus, we were already having the policy about –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8371)|
| 2:19:34| I mean, there's going to be an open plan about limiting visitors to campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8374)|
| 2:19:37| So all of those things complicate more than just, you know, that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8377)|
| 2:19:41| Someone's going to have to do a temperature check on a visit, like that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8381)|
| 2:19:44| So I think there are a lot of factors there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8384)|
| 2:19:46| and I think principals and teachers will have different things at their school that make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8386)|
| 2:19:50| So I think, again, the best thing is probably to make a virtual or on-campus choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8390)|
| 2:19:57| I think those are the cleanest things we're prepared to do now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8397)|
| 2:20:00| But I think that would be, to me, what families should consider, first and foremost, in making their decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8400)|
| 2:20:06| And knowing that there may be some sacrifices they have to make with that, again, from courses we can and can't offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8406)|
| 2:20:11| And then I would say, then, maybe have a conversation with your principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8411)|
| 2:20:15| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8415)|
| 2:20:16| And once again, I want to support my principals on trying to do the best job they can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8416)|
| 2:20:21| because I know this is difficult for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8421)|
| 2:20:23| Mr. Thomas, did you want to weigh in on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8423)|
| 2:20:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8424)|
| 2:20:25| And, John, thank you for that answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8425)|
| 2:20:27| And, Ms. Babb, thank you for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8427)|
| 2:20:29| I was sent to work this morning with specific directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8429)|
| 2:20:31| Don't kill the arts, you know, with what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8431)|
| 2:20:34| So, from my artist wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8434)|
| 2:20:39| So, yes, and just for principals to know where I'm coming from, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8439)|
| 2:20:43| I mean, some students come to school, and, you know, we want them coming for the academic reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8443)|
| 2:20:47| but we also know that students are in performing arts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8447)|
| 2:20:51| They're in the choral music program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8451)|
| 2:20:54| They're in the instrumental program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8454)|
| 2:20:56| They do drama and theater and things of that nature that are extremely important for them being well-rounded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8456)|
| 2:21:03| and also for us to do everything we can do to protect the arts as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8463)|
| 2:21:08| So, even with this virtual program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8468)|
| 2:21:10| So, that's kind of my position on this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8470)|
| 2:21:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8472)|
| 2:21:13| Thank you, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8473)|
| 2:21:14| And, you know, if you're watching and you're thinking about your child being in that situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8474)|
| 2:21:18| I would say make your requests known, but then give them some time to work through these issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8478)|
| 2:21:24| because there are more questions from parents than they are going to be able to deal with quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8484)|
| 2:21:31| So, I would say give them some patience and some grace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8491)|
| 2:21:34| School, they have this time to be able to prepare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8494)|
| 2:21:37| So, please allow them the time to be able to process through those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8497)|
| 2:21:42| You may not get an immediate answer, but it's not because you've been forgotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8502)|
| 2:21:46| They just need some time to process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8506)|
| 2:21:48| I think Ms. Satterfield has some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8508)|
| 2:21:51| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8511)|
| 2:21:53| Just two clarifying questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8513)|
| 2:21:55| So, the virtual, if students go into virtual programming that receive food,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8515)|
| 2:22:02| and my brain's gone, program students be able to receive food and reduce meals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8522)|
| 2:22:08| Is that going to be similar to how we were when we got out of school, the site pickups?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8528)|
| 2:22:12| I believe so, but I know Russ and Brett have worked specifically on this, so it might be best if. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8532)|
| 2:22:19| Brett Foster, do you want to come on up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8539)|
| 2:22:21| Yeah, one of them tackles that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8541)|
| 2:22:23| Sure, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8543)|
| 2:22:25| She's the one with all the answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8545)|
| 2:22:28| Thank you, Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8548)|
| 2:22:30| Yes, we plan on doing a grab-and-go type model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8550)|
| 2:22:33| I think in the updated plan it does say something about parents and students choosing that option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8553)|
| 2:22:39| to contact the school nutrition department to set that up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8559)|
| 2:22:42| just because we are going to be doing our normal lunch service for those students that are in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8562)|
| 2:22:47| So, we just want some advance notice of how many to-go meals we need to prepare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8567)|
| 2:22:51| Okay, but they'll still be able to get it at their home site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8571)|
| 2:22:53| Base school, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8573)|
| 2:22:54| Base school? Okay, awesome. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8574)|
| 2:22:56| And the last clarifying question, I don't have it in question form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8576)|
| 2:22:59| I just want someone to speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8579)|
| 2:23:02| If we go to the more mass-required situation, what does discipline look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8582)|
| 2:23:09| and what does teacher support around that look like to enforce it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8589)|
| 2:23:16| Who would like to take that lovely question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8596)|
| 2:23:19| That's a great question, Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8599)|
| 2:23:22| Nobody wants to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8602)|
| 2:23:26| Dr. Isaac is the winner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8606)|
| 2:23:28| We just drew straws and I got the short one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8608)|
| 2:23:30| Sorry, you lost that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8610)|
| 2:23:32| So, I would say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8612)|
| 2:23:34| This is how we talk to our principals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8614)|
| 2:23:36| And, again, they get this because they do this every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8616)|
| 2:23:40| Mr. Thomas had mentioned it's kind of like caps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8620)|
| 2:23:42| You know, we don't want people wearing hats to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8622)|
| 2:23:45| Our goal is not to make that a suspendable offense, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8625)|
| 2:23:48| So what we're doing is asking them to think about creative ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8628)|
| 2:23:51| We've had some principals, I know one plan that was really good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8631)|
| 2:23:54| they talked about having different color masks for different days of the week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8634)|
| 2:23:57| so we can have things on hand to say, you know, wear this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8637)|
| 2:24:00| and we'll wash them at the end of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8640)|
| 2:24:02| I'm not saying everybody's going to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8642)|
| 2:24:03| but, I mean, there's certain kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8643)|
| 2:24:05| We've thought about, you know, they had there some leeway for a classroom to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8645)|
| 2:24:08| because we do know people are across the board on this, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8648)|
| 2:24:13| and opposed, my parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8653)|
| 2:24:15| So, you know, are there things we could do to create spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8655)|
| 2:24:18| that are socially distanced in parts of a classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8658)|
| 2:24:20| away from students who are wearing masks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8660)|
| 2:24:22| So, again, our idea is to educate kids first, not make this a punitive measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8662)|
| 2:24:26| We do think, and I think we heard the physician speak earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8666)|
| 2:24:29| that, you know, that that is what we need to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8669)|
| 2:24:33| and that is the safest thing we can do for all students and all teachers that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8673)|
| 2:24:37| But, you know, obviously we're not going to deny kids school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8677)|
| 2:24:41| So, our goal would be to think of creative ways to encourage that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8681)|
| 2:24:44| maybe to incentivize that to be something they would do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8684)|
| 2:24:47| and then we ask, you know, try to make the accommodations around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8687)|
| 2:24:50| A lot of parent communication, a lot of conversation about why that happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8690)|
| 2:24:54| and a lot of opportunities to get that right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8694)|
| 2:24:57| and to provide, you know, masks if it's an access issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8697)|
| 2:25:00| and those sorts of things that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8700)|
| 2:25:02| So, I don't have a perfect answer, and we don't want to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8702)|
| 2:25:05| we don't have, like, strike one, strike two, strike three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8705)|
| 2:25:07| Again, it's not supposed to be punitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8707)|
| 2:25:09| We're going to try to educate people that it's the healthy thing to do to be a good citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8709)|
| 2:25:13| Thank you, and I would like to just say that I'm not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8713)|
| 2:25:16| I don't want it to be a punitive situation because we can't afford that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8716)|
| 2:25:21| More discipline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8721)|
| 2:25:22| Totally agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8722)|
| 2:25:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8723)|
| 2:25:24| Thank you, Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8724)|
| 2:25:25| Ms. Christie, do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8725)|
| 2:25:26| I can't tell with your mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8726)|
| 2:25:28| I was just going to ask about the mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8728)|
| 2:25:30| I mean, and I do agree that we need to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8730)|
| 2:25:32| but I'm hearing a lot from especially, you know, kindergarten, first grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8732)|
| 2:25:38| second grade, you know, am I going to spend my whole day having a battle over a mask, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8738)|
| 2:25:47| I mean, I know there's no easy answer for that, but I am hearing that a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8747)|
| 2:25:53| It's a valid question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8753)|
| 2:25:54| I sent a couple of these guys a video that I came across online, and, yeah, there's going to be a lot of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8754)|
| 2:26:01| and, you know, hopefully the first week of school they can spend a lot of time talking about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8761)|
| 2:26:06| and practicing and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8766)|
| 2:26:08| And speaking of that question, I've had a question from a couple of people about teacher evaluations for this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8768)|
| 2:26:15| and that was one of the things that I think I reached out to Dr. Reiswick a while back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8775)|
| 2:26:19| and he and I talked about, you know, what could be helpful in this situation that's so uncertain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8779)|
| 2:26:25| and that was one of the things he had mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8785)|
| 2:26:27| So I've spoken with some of our state delegation, and they are extremely cooperative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8787)|
| 2:26:34| I've talked with Representative Zachary and with Becky Duncan-Massey and Senator Briggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8794)|
| 2:26:40| and they are all very receptive to speaking to the governor and the lieutenant governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8800)|
| 2:26:46| They will likely have a session coming up later in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8806)|
| 2:26:49| I don't know for sure if that will be able to be added, but that's what I've asked for, for them to push for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8809)|
| 2:26:56| So I'm hopeful that maybe we could start the, you know, maybe not start the year knowing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8816)|
| 2:27:02| but at least at the beginning of the year rather than waiting until January session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8822)|
| 2:27:07| So anyway, I just wanted to put that out there that our legislative delegation, the ones I've spoken to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8827)|
| 2:27:13| understand the need for that, and so I'm really hopeful that maybe that can get some traction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8833)|
| 2:27:19| Mr. Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8839)|
| 2:27:20| Yes, thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8840)|
| 2:27:22| We had this conversation just the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8842)|
| 2:27:25| I'm not sure what day it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8845)|
| 2:27:28| But our conversation, and I think 100 percent staff support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8848)|
| 2:27:33| We would like to have a year where we didn't evaluate and also that assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8853)|
| 2:27:39| I'm not sure what the assessment is going to show anyway from the standpoint of teachers have too much on their plate right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8859)|
| 2:27:46| and our principals, we can just get back in school, get back in school safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8866)|
| 2:27:50| Let's put this off a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8870)|
| 2:27:52| So what I'd like to do is bring a resolution to the board to support that so our legislators would agree to that and try for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8872)|
| 2:28:02| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8882)|
| 2:28:03| I mean, I concur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8883)|
| 2:28:04| I think, you know, I think from the very beginning, you know, as this conversation has gone on that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8884)|
| 2:28:11| that I've said to Mr. Thomas and Dr. Reiswick at various times, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8891)|
| 2:28:16| our educators just need to make sure that they're focusing on making sure the students are progressing as they should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8896)|
| 2:28:23| and not have to worry about those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8903)|
| 2:28:26| Our teachers know the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8906)|
| 2:28:27| They know the expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8907)|
| 2:28:29| And they're professionals and they can do their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8909)|
| 2:28:31| So hopefully we'll get some traction on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8911)|
| 2:28:34| And so I just wanted to make sure that that was brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8914)|
| 2:28:38| Do we have other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8918)|
| 2:28:41| I just have one question about the motions that are on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8921)|
| 2:28:46| As Ms. Hill suggested stronger language on math, the issue was coming up about students going in for classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8926)|
| 2:28:58| My concern, I go back to my concern of if we adopt even the language that was presented by Ms. Owen, that that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8938)|
| 2:29:09| who decides, you know, that these are minor things and that the board doesn't need to approve it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8949)|
| 2:29:15| I'm just a little fuzzy on if we needed to come back and approve something, how, you know, I guess the executive team would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8955)|
| 2:29:26| I mean, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8966)|
| 2:29:27| I'm just confused as to who makes that decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8967)|
| 2:29:29| which is why I thought from the beginning that we need to allow the superintendent to do the job we're paying him to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8969)|
| 2:29:36| So I'm still not clear on how this would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8976)|
| 2:29:40| So, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8980)|
| 2:29:41| I think one of the issues that TSBA wanted to be sure that we looked at, something like a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8981)|
| 2:29:48| Does that fall under our dress code policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8988)|
| 2:29:51| Where does that belong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8991)|
| 2:29:53| So looking at it from a perspective of which policies this plan could be impacting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=8993)|
| 2:30:01| I think we will need to look at those policies as we go along and make adjustments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9001)|
| 2:30:08| So I think that was their whole point of us being involved in it would be so, I mean, if we adopt a plan that conflicts with our policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9008)|
| 2:30:17| we have the exact same problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9017)|
| 2:30:20| So I think as we go through, if we adopt with flexibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9020)|
| 2:30:26| which is the point of it that we would have the flexibility to make those adjustments as we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9026)|
| 2:30:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9035)|
| 2:30:36| So my question would be what would, if we needed to come back together to reevaluate and have something new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9036)|
| 2:30:44| what would be an example of something we would come back to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9044)|
| 2:30:49| What's the level we need to go to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9049)|
| 2:30:51| You know, like if we decide that we, if the superintendent talks to the health department and has, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9051)|
| 2:30:57| their guidance is we think you need to go to all virtual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9057)|
| 2:31:00| Are we going to then take two days to think about it and then gather so that we can talk about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9060)|
| 2:31:06| Like is that an example?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9066)|
| 2:31:08| I think that would depend on whether it is an immediate situation, just like if it were a weather event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9068)|
| 2:31:15| If it's something that is happening right now that has to be changed, then that, of course, falls within his duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9075)|
| 2:31:23| So I think as long as it falls within his duties, then he should be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9083)|
| 2:31:30| We could come back and ratify something later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9090)|
| 2:31:32| But if it falls within his duties now, he would still have complete control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9092)|
| 2:31:38| Mr. Norman, did you have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9098)|
| 2:31:39| I can't tell with your mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9099)|
| 2:31:41| No, I'm just hoping that we can move on a little quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9101)|
| 2:31:45| I think that it is Bobby's call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9105)|
| 2:31:50| I want to put as much of the responsibility on him and his staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9110)|
| 2:31:56| and I think also we have a law director who can weigh in on some of these situations where there's a borderline call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9116)|
| 2:32:04| And I'm good with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9124)|
| 2:32:06| Let's vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9126)|
| 2:32:07| I'm calling for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9127)|
| 2:32:10| Mr. Norman, I think this is too big an issue for us to call for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9130)|
| 2:32:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9135)|
| 2:32:16| So we need to vote on whether we have the question, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9136)|
| 2:32:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9143)|
| 2:32:24| I don't see a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9144)|
| 2:32:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9145)|
| 2:32:26| So we have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9146)|
| 2:32:30| So we're voting on whether we're calling for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9150)|
| 2:32:34| We haven't finished the discussion yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9154)|
| 2:32:37| On the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9157)|
| 2:32:38| But right now we're voting on whether we're calling for the question or if we're having more discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9158)|
| 2:32:45| And you want to have more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9165)|
| 2:32:46| Ms. Babb has her mic down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9166)|
| 2:32:52| I mean, do you think you can ask the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9172)|
| 2:32:55| Do you think it's going to get any better if we sit here and talk for another hour?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9175)|
| 2:33:01| I mean that with respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9181)|
| 2:33:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9183)|
| 2:33:05| I wanted to get clarification on exactly what we're voting for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9185)|
| 2:33:08| Remember, we're not going to get a perfect situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9188)|
| 2:33:14| Mr. Dupler, can you weigh in, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9194)|
| 2:33:16| Yeah, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9196)|
| 2:33:17| I can try and help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9197)|
| 2:33:19| So, you know, I think to Mr. Norman's point and Madam Chair, to your point as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9199)|
| 2:33:27| if going through with this plan you all adopt the plan and go with the motion that's been laid on the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9207)|
| 2:33:35| and the superintendent needs to make a change and it violates board policy, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9215)|
| 2:33:42| let's say that he has to truncate the school year and not only would that violate board policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9222)|
| 2:33:50| it would likely violate state law as well, 180 days, then that's going to have to come back before this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9230)|
| 2:33:57| No question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9237)|
| 2:33:58| So that's a good example of what would need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9238)|
| 2:34:01| But if it's anything below a board policy or a state law, then really it's going to be the superintendent's call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9241)|
| 2:34:14| And then as has been suggested, that would require discussion not only with Mr. Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9254)|
| 2:34:22| but with you as the executive committee, and then I can be involved and help however you all would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9262)|
| 2:34:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9270)|
| 2:34:31| And one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9271)|
| 2:34:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9272)|
| 2:34:33| And if that seems satisfactory, I'll rescind the call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9273)|
| 2:34:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9277)|
| 2:34:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9278)|
| 2:34:39| The only question I have, are there any policies currently that are in conflict with this plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9279)|
| 2:34:48| Mr. Dupler, do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9288)|
| 2:34:51| The only one that I saw that could possibly be an issue would be the dress code, which was talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9291)|
| 2:35:03| You know, but again, is a mask part of the dress code or is it part of a safety measure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9303)|
| 2:35:09| So, I mean, you know, even that kind of can be argued either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9309)|
| 2:35:14| So a vote would certainly do away with any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9314)|
| 2:35:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9322)|
| 2:35:23| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9323)|
| 2:35:25| In reference to what the law director was saying, having spent many years at the high school level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9325)|
| 2:35:39| I know for a fact that there will be whatever you do, we all need to do the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9339)|
| 2:35:52| One high school doesn't need to do one thing or one part of the high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200715?start=9352)|
