| 0:08:29| But when you take that oath of office, you commit to representing everyone, including the many people who do not even go to the polls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211218-swearing-in?start=509)|
| 0:08:36| As leaders in our great city, you have a powerful voice in deciding the trajectory of Knoxville, the surrounding area, and the quality of life for the tens of thousands who call Knoxville home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211218-swearing-in?start=516)|

| 0:09:49| And each of you who is here today, because you have a proven track record of doing just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211218-swearing-in?start=589)|
| 0:09:55| As mayor, it is my honor to serve alongside each one of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211218-swearing-in?start=595)|
