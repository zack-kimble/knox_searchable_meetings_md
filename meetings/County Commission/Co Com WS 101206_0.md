| 0:00:00| If commissioners would please take their seats, we are ready to get started for our work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=0)|
| 0:00:08| This is the December edition. First of all, do we have any amendments to the agenda? Anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=8)|
| 0:00:13| anyone would like to add? Oh, pardon me, we need to do a roll call first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=13)|
| 0:00:18| Commissioner McKenzie? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=18)|
| 0:00:20| Commissioner Brolls? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=20)|
| 0:00:22| Commissioner Norman? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=22)|
| 0:00:23| Commissioner Windy? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=23)|
| 0:00:25| Commissioner Briggs? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=25)|
| 0:00:26| Commissioner Anders? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=26)|
| 0:00:27| Commissioner Smith? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=27)|
| 0:00:28| Commissioner Wright? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=28)|
| 0:00:30| Commissioner Brown? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=30)|
| 0:00:31| Commissioner Hammond? Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=31)|
| 0:00:32| Commissioner Shouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=32)|
| 0:00:33| Absent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=33)|
| 0:00:34| You said eight members. Eight members are present. Are there any amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=34)|
| 0:00:41| Commissioner Olinby?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=41)|
| 0:00:42| Yes, I'd like to, for one, postpone the discussion until January on the ten-year plan, alcohol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=42)|
| 0:00:51| and ten-year plan. I'm still doing some research on that. And also, I have a briefing on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=51)|
| 0:00:59| CTV committee meeting that we had last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=59)|
| 0:01:03| So on number 26, we'll just replace the ten-year plan with the CTV, if that's OK?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=63)|
| 0:01:09| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=69)|
| 0:01:10| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=70)|
| 0:01:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Legacy Parks Foundation notified some of us that in order for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=71)|
| 0:01:20| to receive a grant by December 31st, that we have to receive two properties from Legacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=80)|
| 0:01:32| Parks for this grant to be in effect. So I want to put that before the Commission for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=92)|
| 0:01:38| us to talk about today. And Legacy Parks and Mr. Battelle and I think Carol Evans, Bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=98)|
| 0:01:46| Clabo will be here today to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=106)|
| 0:01:48| Is that in conjunction with item number 18?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=108)|
| 0:01:50| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=110)|
| 0:01:53| Is that with the improvements for Western Avenue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=113)|
| 0:01:55| No, no, no. That's separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=115)|
| 0:01:59| So this will be a separate item that we'll add for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=119)|
| 0:02:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=122)|
| 0:02:03| Duly noted from Commissioner Norman. Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=123)|
| 0:02:06| In conjunction with what Commissioner Norman said, could we move that as early as we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=126)|
| 0:02:09| in the agenda? Because we have people here to speak on that, several people, and if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=129)|
| 0:02:13| could move it as quickly as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=133)|
| 0:02:14| Are they ready? Because Tommy Shumpert was wanting to be here, I think, and I'm not sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=134)|
| 0:02:22| that he's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=142)|
| 0:02:23| Carol, how much time do you think you would need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=143)|
| 0:02:25| He's saying three o'clock, though, right, Carol?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=145)|
| 0:02:29| Oh, you don't need it until three o'clock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=149)|
| 0:02:30| Okay. Do you want him to be here for the discussion? Okay. As soon as he gets here, we'll go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=150)|
| 0:02:37| and recognize you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=157)|
| 0:02:38| Okay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=158)|
| 0:02:40| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=160)|
| 0:02:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I know that we have coming up on the agenda next Monday the Midway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=161)|
| 0:02:47| Road, well, excuse me, the sector plan, East sector plan. I'd like to take a few moments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=167)|
| 0:02:54| this afternoon to discuss an alternative to Midway Road, and the only person, or one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=174)|
| 0:03:01| the people that need to speak to it can only be here today and not next Monday. So we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=181)|
| 0:03:06| at least get their input today, if that's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=186)|
| 0:03:09| And since he's a college professor and has class later on this afternoon, I do need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=189)|
| 0:03:14| move him as early on the agenda as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=194)|
| 0:03:17| Okay. We will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=197)|
| 0:03:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=198)|
| 0:03:19| Yes, we'll be happy to add that to the agenda. Commissioner Shouse has also joined us, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=199)|
| 0:03:22| we want to make note of that. Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=202)|
| 0:03:24| Yes. Is there something else you wanted to add with your light still on? Okay. This is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=204)|
| 0:03:30| just a point of order, maybe in the meetings, is that frequently we'll read a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=210)|
| 0:03:34| and we'll start a discussion before a motion has been made to approve, and that motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=214)|
| 0:03:39| is seconded. It seems like we could use more efficient time if we're going to discuss something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=219)|
| 0:03:45| is to be sure that someone wants to make a motion to approve it, and then second the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=225)|
| 0:03:50| motion, because if there's no interest in even getting that far, we don't need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=230)|
| 0:03:53| discussing it. And it's just, I guess, a matter of Robert's rules. Let's limit our discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=233)|
| 0:03:59| to a motion that's on the floor, if the board has agreed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=239)|
| 0:04:05| Okay. We do have discussion items, so if there's something...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=245)|
| 0:04:08| No, no. This isn't with discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=248)|
| 0:04:09| Oh, this is with the regular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=249)|
| 0:04:10| Yes. Resolutions is when a resolution is read before the discussion starts, is let someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=250)|
| 0:04:15| make a motion to approve and second it, because if there's no interest in even having that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=255)|
| 0:04:19| motion on the floor, there's no need to go through a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=259)|
| 0:04:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=262)|
| 0:04:23| And I know we haven't done that hardly forever, but it probably would make more sense and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=263)|
| 0:04:29| we'd be following the rules better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=269)|
| 0:04:31| Certainly. Noted. Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=271)|
| 0:04:35| And while we're at a discussion level, I have a note talking, Dr. Briggs, about the Ethics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=275)|
| 0:04:42| Committee thing. We do not have anything on the Ethics Committee on the agenda yet, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=282)|
| 0:04:49| That's correct. Let me turn my light back on. We don't have anything on there. It is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=289)|
| 0:04:56| the Ethics Committee does meet on Wednesday of this week, and the only item on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=296)|
| 0:05:02| deals with this workshop or whatever we're going to have on that. I was really intending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=302)|
| 0:05:09| to wait until after the holidays, because I know everyone's schedule is full at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=309)|
| 0:05:13| time. I've already prepared some talking points, and these are just my opinion on this, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=313)|
| 0:05:21| when the time comes up, just as a citizen, I'd like to share with the people that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=321)|
| 0:05:25| on that committee, and we'll be discussing it at the Ethics Committee, and we can bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=325)|
| 0:05:29| some of that information, I think, to the people that have agreed to serve on the Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=329)|
| 0:05:34| that will be looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=334)|
| 0:05:36| And one other piece of information, Mr. Chairman, is that you asked me to look at having the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=336)|
| 0:05:42| workshop meeting in January at the Farragut Town Hall, and that has been arranged. I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=342)|
| 0:05:49| that the date of the workshop, I may be wrong, I think that's a federal holiday on the Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=349)|
| 0:05:55| but the Tuesday would be the day after that, which we, in the past, have had our workshops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=355)|
| 0:06:01| when there was a, or had our meetings when there was a federal holiday. And I'll get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=361)|
| 0:06:06| together with you on the exact date of that, because I don't have those off the top of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=366)|
| 0:06:09| my head. Joe Lee passed me a message, but we have set that up with the Town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=369)|
| 0:06:14| Okay, great. We can discuss that next Monday during the Chairman's Lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=374)|
| 0:06:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=377)|
| 0:06:18| Great. Thank you for doing that, by the way. Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=378)|
| 0:06:22| I think it's the 18th. I've got, Joe Lee, I didn't even look at the note she passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=382)|
| 0:06:27| me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=387)|
| 0:06:28| It's the 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=388)|
| 0:06:29| It's the 18th, and that's the date that we reserved it for. It's at, we reserved it for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=389)|
| 0:06:34| 2 o'clock, and this is the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=394)|
| 0:06:36| For this workshop, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=396)|
| 0:06:39| Our agenda set, next item is the approval of minutes of the previous meeting. Do I hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=399)|
| 0:06:43| a motion to approve? Oh, pardon me, you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=403)|
| 0:06:46| I'm here on behalf of Grant Rosenberg. He would like agenda item number 11, deferred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=406)|
| 0:06:52| for 30 days. There are some due diligence items they're still working on, and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=412)|
| 0:06:56| need another 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=416)|
| 0:06:59| Okay, duly noted. And, yes, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=419)|
| 0:07:07| I am also from Community Development, and we need item number 12. The representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=427)|
| 0:07:13| from Catholic Health Care Partners will be here on Monday to speak to full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=433)|
| 0:07:17| If we could just move that without recommendation to Monday, and we'll discuss it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=437)|
| 0:07:24| And we've made a note on that when we get to it, or we'll do that for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=444)|
| 0:07:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=449)|
| 0:07:29| I'm sure it's not a problem. I have a consent I would like to mention, but let me first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=449)|
| 0:07:35| of all move to the approval of the minutes. Is there a motion to approve the minutes from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=455)|
| 0:07:38| last time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=458)|
| 0:07:39| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=459)|
| 0:07:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=459)|
| 0:07:40| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=460)|
| 0:07:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=462)|
| 0:07:43| Motion passes. These are the suggestions I have for a consent. Items number 3, 4, 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=463)|
| 0:07:52| 6, 7, 8, 10, 13, 15, 19, 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=472)|
| 0:08:07| Does anyone want to remove any of those, or is this okay? If not, I'll entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=487)|
| 0:08:16| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=496)|
| 0:08:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=497)|
| 0:08:18| Item number 7, did you have that on consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=498)|
| 0:08:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=502)|
| 0:08:23| If there's someone here from the school board that could speak to it, I'd like to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=503)|
| 0:08:28| just a sentence or two about what that might be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=508)|
| 0:08:31| Sure, we'll remove that and have that discussion. Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=511)|
| 0:08:35| Item number 15, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=515)|
| 0:08:37| We'll remove item number 15. Any others? Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=517)|
| 0:08:42| Well, I would like to speak to item 12. I see the young lady from community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=522)|
| 0:08:48| I don't know if she's trying to leave the room, but I'd like to speak to 12 if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=528)|
| 0:08:59| Yes, go ahead. If you want to go ahead and ask your, do you have a question or do you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=539)|
| 0:09:04| just want to speak to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=544)|
| 0:09:05| I actually just want to speak to it. I don't, if you want to bring it up now, fine, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=545)|
| 0:09:09| I'm fine to wait until that point comes on the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=549)|
| 0:09:12| Okay, let me go ahead and get the consent approved and then I'll just go ahead and move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=552)|
| 0:09:15| you up so you can go. Is this okay with the consent? Do I have a motion that we move those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=555)|
| 0:09:19| items to consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=559)|
| 0:09:20| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=560)|
| 0:09:21| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=561)|
| 0:09:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=562)|
| 0:09:23| Let's move up item number 12 first. So, Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=563)|
| 0:09:27| Well, I guess I have some concern with this, so I'd like to hear a lot more about the why's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=567)|
| 0:09:36| You know, this sounds like this, this in lieu of taxes process was set up for a, to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=576)|
| 0:09:43| in general. So, and I think it, I think just reading it at face value is something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=583)|
| 0:09:51| was approved by the county that is a revenue stream for a purpose and to give them what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=591)|
| 0:09:58| amounts to be a significant, in terms of years, waiving of that 10% seems to be unfair to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=598)|
| 0:10:05| other entities that have, that's had to incur this expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=605)|
| 0:10:10| So, I guess I'd just like to understand how many other outfits out there have been paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=610)|
| 0:10:17| this 10%? What kind of money are we talking about from that 98 to 2005 time frame? And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=617)|
| 0:10:26| really just a justification of why not. I mean, if it was a facility that was up and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=626)|
| 0:10:30| running and should have been paying this in lieu of taxes, so I'm real hesitant right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=630)|
| 0:10:34| now to approve a waiving of those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=634)|
| 0:10:37| So, I just want to kind of give you some, an idea of what I'm going to be asking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=637)|
| 0:10:42| on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=642)|
| 0:10:43| And I have talked with, her name is Mary DeMoy, with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=643)|
| 0:10:47| Hold the mic down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=647)|
| 0:10:48| Hold the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=648)|
| 0:10:49| Would you state your name and address of the record please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=649)|
| 0:10:51| Sheila Munzer, Knox County Community Development, 400 Main. And Mary DeMoy is with Catholic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=651)|
| 0:11:00| Healthcare Partners and she will be here on Monday to speak to this and I, we have talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=660)|
| 0:11:06| about, she needs to know exactly what amount of funds would have been set aside for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=666)|
| 0:11:12| time period. And exactly, she has indicated that they have been involved with retrofitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=672)|
| 0:11:18| and doing changes to the buildings and what they have done to do as the contract calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=678)|
| 0:11:26| Okay, and I guess also I would just like to get a, hate to call it a recommendation, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=686)|
| 0:11:32| a recommendation slash justification from community development. Because it sounds like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=692)|
| 0:11:36| you all have taken this information in and you're, the way it reads, you're all agreeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=696)|
| 0:11:41| that this is something that you're going to push for. So I'd like to get some kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=701)|
| 0:11:46| understanding of why you're recommending that these funds are going to be waived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=706)|
| 0:11:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=711)|
| 0:11:52| I don't need it now, but I just want to, again, just kind of give you some questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=712)|
| 0:11:57| so you can go back and do the research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=717)|
| 0:11:59| Okay, that would be great. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=719)|
| 0:12:02| Let's go ahead and take up item 12. There was a suggestion that this be moved on without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=722)|
| 0:12:05| a recommendation. Is there a motion to that effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=725)|
| 0:12:07| I so move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=727)|
| 0:12:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=728)|
| 0:12:09| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=729)|
| 0:12:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=730)|
| 0:12:11| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=731)|
| 0:12:12| Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=732)|
| 0:12:13| On page two, item number seven. Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=733)|
| 0:12:19| County, Tennessee approving the acceptance of intent to fund the voluntary pre-K for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=739)|
| 0:12:23| Tennessee program by grant award from the Tennessee Department of Education in the amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=743)|
| 0:12:27| of $1,773,590.21, resolution 204.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=747)|
| 0:12:33| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=753)|
| 0:12:35| It's on education consent, so it's going to be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=755)|
| 0:12:40| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=760)|
| 0:12:42| We'll have to approve these anyway, so it's been taken off consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=762)|
| 0:12:47| Okay, so move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=767)|
| 0:12:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=769)|
| 0:12:50| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=770)|
| 0:12:51| Oh, wait a minute. We have discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=771)|
| 0:12:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=772)|
| 0:12:53| Russ, can you come down and answer Mr. Wright's questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=773)|
| 0:12:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=777)|
| 0:12:58| Thank you, Russ Oaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=778)|
| 0:13:00| The thing that I'm asking for is for those watching at home, this is $1,700,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=780)|
| 0:13:06| This is a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=786)|
| 0:13:07| What's this going to help us with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=787)|
| 0:13:09| It goes to fund what we call the Governor's pre-K program, and it's the state portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=789)|
| 0:13:14| of the funds for that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=794)|
| 0:13:17| If I recall correctly, that's funding about 22 or 24 pre-K classes across the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=797)|
| 0:13:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=805)|
| 0:13:27| Motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=807)|
| 0:13:28| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=808)|
| 0:13:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=809)|
| 0:13:30| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=810)|
| 0:13:31| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=811)|
| 0:13:32| Item number nine, consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=812)|
| 0:13:36| authorizing the expenditure of stormwater civil penalty funds for stormwater-related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=816)|
| 0:13:40| purposes as determined by the Director of Engineering and Public Works, Resolution 401.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=820)|
| 0:13:45| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=826)|
| 0:13:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=827)|
| 0:13:48| Well, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=828)|
| 0:13:50| Dwight, if you'd come forward, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=830)|
| 0:13:52| When we say determined by the Director of Engineering and Public Works, what criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=832)|
| 0:13:57| is being used for these funds and how they're to be spent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=837)|
| 0:14:01| Commissioner, our spending of them has really been very limited up until now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=841)|
| 0:14:04| Daniel Sanders identified that there was a lack of clear legislative authority on how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=844)|
| 0:14:09| they were to be spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=849)|
| 0:14:10| We envision them being spent really in two areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=850)|
| 0:14:13| One is remediation of sites that have failed due to improperly installed stormwater controls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=853)|
| 0:14:18| particularly in cases where the bond amounts, if we foreclosed on the bond, might not be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=858)|
| 0:14:23| sufficient to get the site fully remediated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=863)|
| 0:14:26| And the other is for staff development, just keeping the staff trained up to the standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=866)|
| 0:14:32| of our NPDES Phase 2 permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=872)|
| 0:14:34| Will Commission be advised of how these funds are spent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=874)|
| 0:14:37| Will there be any type of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| I guess I'm looking for an accountability process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=879)|
| 0:14:41| Certainly, if you'd like one, we'd be glad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=881)|
| 0:14:44| I'd recommend maybe annually because, quite frankly, the amounts of money are not very large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=884)|
| 0:14:48| And if we did it on a monthly basis, I think it's going to be of very little consequence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=888)|
| 0:14:54| Would quarterly be acceptable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=894)|
| 0:14:55| It's fine with us, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=895)|
| 0:14:58| I'd like to ask that when these funds are expended and how they're done, if a report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=898)|
| 0:15:02| could be made to Commission, at least on a quarterly basis, just so we have some kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=902)|
| 0:15:06| of documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=906)|
| 0:15:07| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=907)|
| 0:15:08| I'll just incorporate it into the quarterly reports that you receive from finance, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=908)|
| 0:15:10| that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=910)|
| 0:15:11| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=911)|
| 0:15:12| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=912)|
| 0:15:13| And Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=913)|
| 0:15:14| You've partially answered my question when you say funds are insignificant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=914)|
| 0:15:19| Maybe $1,000 or $10,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=919)|
| 0:15:22| Well, they're more significant than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=922)|
| 0:15:24| I think on hand right now we have about $40,000 in this account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=924)|
| 0:15:28| Mr. Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=928)|
| 0:15:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=930)|
| 0:15:32| Dwight, is your new data system capable of putting out some type of report quarterly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=932)|
| 0:15:43| for us on this particular topic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=943)|
| 0:15:46| I mean, just so say, how many NOVs have been issued?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=946)|
| 0:15:51| How many citations have been issued?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=951)|
| 0:15:54| Some type of summary documentation that we might receive quarterly or at some regular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=954)|
| 0:16:01| interval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=961)|
| 0:16:02| Would you check on that with Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=962)|
| 0:16:05| I'd be glad to, Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=965)|
| 0:16:08| I would want to say, though, that the city work system that you're referring to, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=968)|
| 0:16:12| on the work order side, and I think it can do just exactly the things that you're asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=972)|
| 0:16:16| about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=976)|
| 0:16:17| It won't track over to the financial side on the civil penalty funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=977)|
| 0:16:21| Those would be maintained in Munis on the finance side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=981)|
| 0:16:25| But the items that you're talking about, certainly it could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=985)|
| 0:16:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=988)|
| 0:16:29| Some type of report on either side, I think it would be helpful to receive with some regularity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=989)|
| 0:16:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=994)|
| 0:16:35| I'd be delighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=995)|
| 0:16:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=996)|
| 0:16:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=997)|
| 0:16:38| No other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=998)|
| 0:16:39| We have a motion on the table to approve, and it's been properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=999)|

| 0:17:47| Commissioner Norman, you have a question about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1067)|
| 0:17:48| Yeah, I just wanted somebody to tell me a little bit about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1068)|
| 0:17:53| What's the item number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1073)|
| 0:17:54| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1074)|
| 0:17:55| I've lost my screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1075)|
| 0:17:56| Number 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1076)|
| 0:17:57| 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1077)|
| 0:17:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1078)|
| 0:17:59| Is somebody here from health?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1079)|
| 0:18:01| I don't see anyone here from the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1081)|
| 0:18:05| I talked to Martha this morning and I think she's going to be here at some point. Maybe we could defer this and put it at the end of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1085)|
| 0:18:15| I think she told me she was going to be here this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1095)|
| 0:18:18| Can we move it to the end of the agenda? We'll just go ahead and hold it. We do have a motion in a second, but we haven't voted, but we can move it to the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1098)|
| 0:18:24| But what's going to happen here on 14 and 15, they will not be on consent Monday, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1104)|
| 0:18:28| If they don't get spoken to, they don't show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1108)|
| 0:18:31| I'm okay with 14. I just had a quick question. I'm sure I can get an answer, but number 15, we'll move that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1111)|
| 0:18:36| Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1116)|
| 0:18:39| On page 4, item 16, consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1119)|
| 0:18:45| approving a memorandum of understanding between Knox County, the City of Knoxville, and Public Building Authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1125)|
| 0:18:50| to provide for greater energy efficiencies and improvements to the City-County Building, Resolution 801.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1130)|
| 0:18:56| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1136)|
| 0:18:57| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1137)|
| 0:18:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1138)|
| 0:19:00| Let's see. I had some questions, but Commissioner Norman, did you have your light on for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1140)|
| 0:19:05| John, I'm glad you came down because could you explain to me how this is going to work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1145)|
| 0:19:10| Essentially, the City, and this is a contract through the City's Purchasing Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1150)|
| 0:19:16| they've contracted with an energy efficiency company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1156)|
| 0:19:19| The City will advance to PBA $1.6 million, almost $1.7 million, to do energy improvements to this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1159)|
| 0:19:29| The City will bear about a third of the cost. The County will bear about two-thirds of the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1169)|
| 0:19:34| And over time, that will be reflected in our payments to PBA each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1174)|
| 0:19:39| But the City will gain about one-third of the savings, and the County will gain two-thirds of the savings over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1179)|
| 0:19:46| And so the payback on this is just under seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1186)|
| 0:19:50| And so our expectation is, with an investment of $1.7 million, both City and County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1190)|
| 0:19:56| that the eventual payback will be that $1.7 million plus an additional savings of $1.6 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1196)|
| 0:20:03| which the County would get two-thirds of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1203)|
| 0:20:07| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1207)|
| 0:20:08| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1208)|
| 0:20:10| Seven years, that seems to be, you know, as I listen to, you know, green buildings, energy efficiencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1210)|
| 0:20:18| normally it's more like a three- to four-year payback before companies, entities, would kind of enter into agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1218)|
| 0:20:28| In fact, I think with Bernard Cain's organization that came last year, a year before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1228)|
| 0:20:34| I think that was like a 24-month payback or a three-year payback, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1234)|
| 0:20:38| So that seven years seems to be a little excessive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1238)|
| 0:20:41| I don't know if you all built in some factors into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1241)|
| 0:20:45| but I have issues with a seven-year payback on a significant undertaking like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1245)|
| 0:20:53| The City has been through quite a few of the details,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1253)|
| 0:20:57| and I think that's what we need to do is we'll provide more details of what went into those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1257)|
| 0:21:03| There's different lighting, lighting control, utility control, and hot water improvements to this building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1263)|
| 0:21:09| and this building is expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1269)|
| 0:21:15| So that slows down your payback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1275)|
| 0:21:17| And so I'd be glad to provide more details, and we can talk more about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1277)|
| 0:21:21| I mean, yeah, it's expensive, but it's also pretty inefficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1281)|
| 0:21:24| So that kind of speeds up your payback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1284)|
| 0:21:26| So there's a balance there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| I'd just like to get a little more comfortable with that, with that seven-year payback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1288)|
| 0:21:33| in terms of how you all arrived at that figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1293)|
| 0:21:37| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1297)|
| 0:21:38| Be glad to provide that to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1298)|
| 0:21:41| So the motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| It's been seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1303)|
| 0:21:44| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1304)|
| 0:21:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1305)|
| 0:21:46| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1306)|
| 0:21:47| I guess with that promise, no opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1307)|
| 0:21:53| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1313)|
| 0:21:54| Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1314)|
| 0:21:55| Item number 17,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1315)|
| 0:21:57| consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee, extending for one month through January 31, 2011,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1317)|
| 0:22:03| the moratorium on the insurance of beer permits to drive through liquor establishments where beer sales are currently not permitted by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1323)|
| 0:22:10| Knox County Resolution 802.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1330)|
| 0:22:12| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1332)|
| 0:22:13| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1333)|
| 0:22:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1334)|
| 0:22:15| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| I had pulled this off, too, to see if there was any discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1337)|
| 0:22:20| But if there's not any discussion, all those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1340)|
| 0:22:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1343)|
| 0:22:24| The motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1344)|
| 0:22:25| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1345)|
| 0:22:26| Item 18, consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1346)|
| 0:22:30| respectfully requesting the Tennessee Department of Transportation to amend its contract for road improvements to Western Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1350)|
| 0:22:37| in order to make provisions to facilitate the extension of the Third Creek Greenway to connect with the Victor Ashe Greenway Resolution 901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1357)|
| 0:22:46| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1366)|
| 0:22:47| Make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1369)|
| 0:22:50| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1370)|
| 0:22:51| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1371)|
| 0:22:52| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1372)|
| 0:22:53| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1373)|
| 0:22:54| All this is is Western Avenue is going to go under a widening effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1374)|
| 0:23:01| And so in the process, it's pretty far down in the planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1381)|
| 0:23:05| I mean, the planning and all the provisions for what's going to take place have pretty much been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1385)|
| 0:23:11| So what we discovered in that process, there was really not any accommodation of a greenway that's been in the plan for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1391)|
| 0:23:23| And so all this is is just an effort to put on DOT's screen that when you're doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1403)|
| 0:23:32| there's specifically one spot where Third Creek goes under Western Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1412)|
| 0:23:37| We would like for you to consider making amendments to your contract so that sometime in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1417)|
| 0:23:44| if monies are available, Third Creek Greenway could be extended and be built and extend out to Victor Ashe Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1424)|
| 0:23:51| And so all it is is just, hey, this is a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| Keep it in mind when you're letting the contract and you're finalizing your contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1434)|
| 0:24:01| Mr. Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1441)|
| 0:24:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1442)|
| 0:24:03| This is not in any way to talk about greenways, but it brings to mind several road projects in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1443)|
| 0:24:13| of which I've asked Dwight Vanderveet to look into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1453)|
| 0:24:17| And I'd like to name those just so people at home would know that we, commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1457)|
| 0:24:21| are interested in what's happening to our greenways, right-of-ways, and roadways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1461)|
| 0:24:27| I've asked about halls on Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1467)|
| 0:24:30| I've asked about Gibbs-Tazewell Pike on Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1470)|
| 0:24:35| I've asked about Millertown Pike from I-640 into the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1475)|
| 0:24:44| And although that conversation starts in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1484)|
| 0:24:48| I believe that the county needs to respond to us about the citizens of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1488)|
| 0:24:53| about where that particular roadway might be fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1493)|
| 0:24:57| And one other thing, the Washington Pike connector there at the Ridda Elementary School parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1497)|
| 0:25:09| doesn't slow traffic down the first day of school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1509)|
| 0:25:13| It just stops traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1513)|
| 0:25:15| So in addition to this one thing that's been asked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1515)|
| 0:25:19| I've asked for some other bits of roadway information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1519)|
| 0:25:26| and thought that might also bring to mind other roadway considerations for other commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1526)|
| 0:25:32| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| Commissioner Shouse, is this something that the Transportation Planning Organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1533)|
| 0:25:36| could also look at this greenway, maybe make a request to the TPO to put it on their radar screen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1536)|
| 0:25:41| I think that would be a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| I was trying to think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1543)|
| 0:25:46| It ends there by the ice skating rink, doesn't it, now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1546)|
| 0:25:55| You're talking about Third Creek?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1555)|
| 0:25:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1557)|
| 0:25:58| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1558)|
| 0:25:59| But we're talking about close to Ash Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1559)|
| 0:26:02| Because it does go on slightly to Bearden Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1562)|
| 0:26:06| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1566)|
| 0:26:07| There's a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1567)|
| 0:26:10| There's a drawing that's on a map that has a couple of alternatives for routes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1570)|
| 0:26:16| but basically it follows the northwest trail of Third Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1576)|
| 0:26:22| which basically goes up into the Norwood community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1582)|
| 0:26:27| And so the trail prospectively would run along Third Creek through KUB property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1587)|
| 0:26:34| and down the Middlebrook Pike Farm area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1594)|
| 0:26:38| But that's well into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1598)|
| 0:26:40| We've got to get funds for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| I mean, that's a whole other issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| It's just that while they're doing the road project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1604)|
| 0:26:47| where it goes under the box, that box culvert that goes under Western Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1607)|
| 0:26:53| it may be big enough now to accommodate a bike lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1613)|
| 0:26:57| But if it isn't, it would be smart, or whatever excavation that needs to be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1617)|
| 0:27:02| it would just be smart to go ahead and do it while that, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1622)|
| 0:27:06| So that's all we're telling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1626)|
| 0:27:07| We're just talking to DOT, just to say, hey, keep an eye out for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1627)|
| 0:27:10| This is something that's on the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| It needs to be taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1632)|
| 0:27:14| Commissioner Norman, if you would write a letter to Commissioner Shouse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| you can just send it to me, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1637)|
| 0:27:18| We're both on TPO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1638)|
| 0:27:19| We can make that part of our record for the planning process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1639)|
| 0:27:22| so that it's on their radar screen as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1642)|
| 0:27:23| because sometimes funding comes through there that can help facilitate these types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1643)|
| 0:27:27| We'll do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1647)|
| 0:27:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1648)|
| 0:27:29| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1649)|
| 0:27:30| Not related to Commissioner Norman's resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1650)|
| 0:27:35| but more so to what Commissioner Wright was discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| I think one other road, county road, that feeds into that is that Love's Creek project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1658)|
| 0:27:44| I know we had discussed that a year and a half or so ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1664)|
| 0:27:47| but that's another bottleneck that I think would be great to get some answers on as to where that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1667)|
| 0:27:54| Mr. Vandervee, did you make a note of all of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1674)|
| 0:27:56| So duly noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| The motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| Commissioner Norman, did you have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1682)|
| 0:28:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1683)|
| 0:28:04| Motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1684)|
| 0:28:05| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1685)|
| 0:28:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1686)|
| 0:28:07| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1687)|
| 0:28:08| Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1688)|
| 0:28:09| Item number 20, consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1689)|
| 0:28:14| expressing the commission's desire for the city county building parking garage to be accessible to the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1694)|
| 0:28:19| during the regular monthly meeting of the Knox County Commission Resolution 903.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1699)|
| 0:28:24| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1704)|
| 0:28:28| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1708)|
| 0:28:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1711)|
| 0:28:32| Okay, motion made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1712)|
| 0:28:33| This is my resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| I'm just basically asking the mayors to take a look at when we have our regular monthly meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1716)|
| 0:28:41| to have spaces in the garage available for people to park here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1721)|
| 0:28:44| My feeling is if we can do it for football games and booms day, for our regular meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1724)|
| 0:28:51| particularly as we're getting into cold weather, that we need to take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1731)|
| 0:28:54| We can't do it ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1734)|
| 0:28:56| The resolution would make a request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| So, Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1738)|
| 0:28:59| Yeah, I just had a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1739)|
| 0:29:01| You know, I think it's a good idea what you're proposing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| but then to get into this building where they can attend the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1744)|
| 0:29:08| I guess they'll have to go out the garage, go up the ramp, go around the block,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1748)|
| 0:29:13| and come in the door because we don't have scanners, the metal-to-scanners, we don't have guards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1753)|
| 0:29:19| The buildings are still going to be locked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| Is that what the intention is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1762)|
| 0:29:26| No, the intention would be for them to have easier access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1766)|
| 0:29:29| Just for parking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| No, to also get into the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| Okay, so then I guess we'd have to put scanners down there too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1773)|
| 0:29:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1776)|
| 0:29:37| Or have it on this floor as they come up this floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| This is why I'm asking them to take a look at it and see about the feasibility of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1780)|
| 0:29:43| and see what we would need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1783)|
| 0:29:45| If it passes, I'll follow that up with a letter expressing some of these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1785)|
| 0:29:51| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1791)|
| 0:29:52| I just want to echo what Dr. Briggs said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1792)|
| 0:29:55| You know, I would be the first to agree that, you know, people need to be able to get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1795)|
| 0:30:00| to have a place to park to come to the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1800)|
| 0:30:02| but getting into the building from the backside is really going to be a tough nut to crack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1802)|
| 0:30:10| It looks like they're probably going to have to come up the ramp and, you know, like on L1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1810)|
| 0:30:14| I don't see any other way of getting them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1814)|
| 0:30:17| There's not another elevator, you know, down there where they could be channel two to come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1817)|
| 0:30:26| Yes, Mr. Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1826)|
| 0:30:27| Yeah, thanks, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1827)|
| 0:30:28| I just had another thought after Mike made that comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1828)|
| 0:30:32| You know, something else, if this isn't feasible, I think it's not necessarily the proximity of the parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1832)|
| 0:30:38| because it's really not too far from the Dwight Kessel garage over here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1838)|
| 0:30:42| but I was wondering if another option, you know, if this doesn't work out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1842)|
| 0:30:46| and I do think it's a good resolution, is to give people who attend this meeting vouchers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1846)|
| 0:30:51| so they don't have to pay when they leave because, at least what I've heard from other people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1851)|
| 0:30:56| it's not necessarily the distance or anything because I think by the time they walk from down there and around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1856)|
| 0:31:00| which they may very well end up having to do, it's going to be just about as far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1860)|
| 0:31:05| but if they have a voucher, they're not going to have to pay to park if they're attending this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1865)|
| 0:31:09| Just another thought to put out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1869)|
| 0:31:12| Could we have that as an amendment that we look at vouchers not only for our regular meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1872)|
| 0:31:17| but for our workshops or any other meeting we have that if someone has come down here that we give them a voucher?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1877)|
| 0:31:22| Would the maker of the motion consider adding that as an amendment to look at possible vouchers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1882)|
| 0:31:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1887)|
| 0:31:29| And the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| Who seconded the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1891)|
| 0:31:34| Owen being Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1894)|
| 0:31:36| Is it me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1896)|
| 0:31:37| Yes. Would you agree to look at the vouchers as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1900)|
| 0:31:41| So that's the motion to look at opening the garage or at least also look at voucher system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1907)|
| 0:31:48| Any opposition? Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| Item 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1912)|
| 0:31:55| requesting that Knox County Audit Committee conduct a performance appraisal of Knox County Internal Auditor Richard Walsh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1915)|
| 0:32:01| Resolution 904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1921)|
| 0:32:03| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1923)|
| 0:32:04| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1924)|
| 0:32:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1925)|
| 0:32:06| This, again, was my resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1926)|
| 0:32:07| I've talked with Richard about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1927)|
| 0:32:08| He doesn't have an issue with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1928)|
| 0:32:10| I just feel that we need to have appraisals of our people, have them held accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1930)|
| 0:32:14| If there's a way of improving the way business is done, I think we owe it to our citizens to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1934)|
| 0:32:19| So I appreciate the motion and the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1939)|
| 0:32:22| And Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1942)|
| 0:32:24| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1944)|
| 0:32:25| I agree wholeheartedly with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1945)|
| 0:32:28| I think this will be a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1948)|
| 0:32:30| But I'd like to maybe add a little bit to it in terms of trying to get a grasp around what an average year will look like in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1950)|
| 0:32:41| So I'd like to proactively say that the Internal Audit Office is going to conduct three internal assessments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1961)|
| 0:32:50| five internal assessments per year, try to define those roles and responsibilities a little tighter than I think it's been in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1970)|
| 0:33:00| I mean, it's not a knock or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1980)|
| 0:33:05| But I'd just like to get a better understanding going into a year, going into a quarter, what the expectations are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1985)|
| 0:33:10| since I'm assuming they do report to commission, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1990)|
| 0:33:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1995)|
| 0:33:16| So, yeah, as a commissioner, I would like to, a manager, I guess I'll say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=1996)|
| 0:33:21| I'd like to get a little better feel for what the average year is looking like and, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2001)|
| 0:33:27| just try to do some more roles and responsibilities and maybe authorities as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2007)|
| 0:33:34| I'll ask Mr. Carsello to come to the chairman's lunch next Monday at 1135 and he will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2014)|
| 0:33:39| And so these are things that I'm hopeful we can discuss with him as we look into this performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2019)|
| 0:33:44| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2024)|
| 0:33:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| Richard, I believe from one of our discussions someplace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2027)|
| 0:33:51| wasn't there supposed to be an appraisal that's required either as part of the job description or something every three years anyway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2031)|
| 0:33:59| I mean, this is a very good idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2039)|
| 0:34:01| but it's doing something that I think we're supposed to have been doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| We're already doing all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2044)|
| 0:34:07| We have a risk-based work plan that we work under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2047)|
| 0:34:12| And we do report every two months to the audit committee, and you all are welcome to attend it if you like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2052)|
| 0:34:20| where we go into detail to our reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2060)|
| 0:34:23| And we did have a peer review that's been less than a year ago that was furnished to the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2063)|
| 0:34:33| So all these things we already do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2073)|
| 0:34:37| I think that's what I was recalling was the peer review that was required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2077)|
| 0:34:42| Is that every three years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2082)|
| 0:34:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2083)|
| 0:34:44| Actually, under the yellow book, it's every three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2084)|
| 0:34:48| Under the red book, which is the IIA standard, it's every five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2088)|
| 0:34:52| And we do the more strict every three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2092)|
| 0:34:55| And we did one, I believe it was finished and reported on last January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2095)|
| 0:35:00| I remember that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2100)|
| 0:35:01| So, yeah, thank you very much for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| Mr. Shouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2103)|
| 0:35:04| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2104)|
| 0:35:05| Are you a performance appraisal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2105)|
| 0:35:09| Is that a performance review just like people have on their jobs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2109)|
| 0:35:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2113)|
| 0:35:14| If this were IBM, you would do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2114)|
| 0:35:16| Let me give the commission a 30-second review of what's happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2116)|
| 0:35:23| Roughly a year ago, let me back up, this would be early 2009, so almost two years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2123)|
| 0:35:30| Dr. Corsello and myself did a review of Richard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2130)|
| 0:35:34| And then a year later, one was initiated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2134)|
| 0:35:40| And to make it more equitable, I guess that's the right word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2140)|
| 0:35:45| he requested all members of the audit committee, that's fives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2145)|
| 0:35:48| so it's not an unmanageable number like 19 or 11, I think fives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2148)|
| 0:35:52| And some of us did that, and I think all of us did it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2152)|
| 0:35:56| but Joe probably needs to jump in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| It went to Mr. Lockett because we couldn't obviously talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2158)|
| 0:36:04| well, you think Richard's doing a good job or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| We couldn't, it was sunshine law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| So we did reviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2168)|
| 0:36:09| They went to Bill Lockett, and then it somehow got stalled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2169)|
| 0:36:14| Obviously, there's been turnover since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2174)|
| 0:36:16| Mr. Saunders is no longer on the audit committee, and Amy, or Ms. Burles, replaced him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2176)|
| 0:36:21| And so I don't mind doing another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2181)|
| 0:36:24| It's been almost a year, I guess, so we need to do another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2184)|
| 0:36:27| But we did have a procedure that they were made once a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2187)|
| 0:36:32| Am I correct in that, Joe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2192)|
| 0:36:33| I think the paperwork maybe went to Bill's desk and got misplaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2193)|
| 0:36:37| That's precisely correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| Okay, so we didn't totally drop the ball on it, but I'm glad you have this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2199)|
| 0:36:43| so it will get us moving on it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| Sure, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2205)|
| 0:36:46| And I talked to Mr. Carsello before I brought this up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2206)|
| 0:36:48| and he had mentioned the fact that there had been some confusion there with Mr. Lockett's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2208)|
| 0:36:51| and he said that he's very willing to undertake this type of thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2211)|
| 0:36:55| and, quite frankly, thinks it's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| So, again, he will be at our meeting on Monday to answer any questions that you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2217)|
| 0:37:01| And maybe we should touch on it at the regular meeting also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2221)|
| 0:37:05| so Commissioner Burles will realize that she's involved and needs to do a review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2225)|
| 0:37:12| like the other four of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| So the motion is made and seconded to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2234)|
| 0:37:17| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2237)|
| 0:37:18| If not, all those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2240)|
| 0:37:21| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2241)|
| 0:37:22| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2242)|
| 0:37:23| I'd like to, at this point, if we could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2243)|
| 0:37:25| Commissioner Wright has asked that we address the Midway discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2245)|
| 0:37:28| and if there's no one that objects, I'd like to go ahead and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2248)|
| 0:37:33| I have just a question regarding this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| is that obviously a stakeholder in the Midway discussion is the Development Corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2255)|
| 0:37:42| Todd's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2262)|
| 0:37:43| I don't know if he needed any of the other people from down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2263)|
| 0:37:47| because I think if we're going to have a discussion over it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2267)|
| 0:37:49| we need to have the people that are involved in the discussion here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2269)|
| 0:37:52| I mean, that's the only negative about putting this on at short notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2272)|
| 0:37:56| but he's here now and I didn't see him earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2276)|
| 0:38:04| Let me do this if we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| Dr. Buchanan is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2286)|
| 0:38:07| Can we go back to item number 15 and get that taken care of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2287)|
| 0:38:10| I don't think it will take that long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| So, Dr. Buchanan, we have on item number 15,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| the motion has been made and seconded to approve, but there was some question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2295)|
| 0:38:19| Commissioner Norman, was that you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| Commissioner Norman had some questions for you, Doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| Martha Buchanan, Knox County Health Department, 140 Dameron Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| and I apologize for my tardiness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2305)|
| 0:38:28| No problem, Martha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2308)|
| 0:38:29| Thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2309)|
| 0:38:30| I just didn't have any background about this and just wanted some explanation, that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2310)|
| 0:38:38| This is, I think, the fourth year, fourth time, not fourth year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2318)|
| 0:38:43| fourth time the University of Tennessee has provided this service for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2323)|
| 0:38:48| to do the behavioral risk assessment phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2328)|
| 0:38:51| They use a random calling system to call adults who live in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2331)|
| 0:38:57| and ask them about healthy behaviors and risky behaviors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2337)|
| 0:39:01| and that information is used by our partners to guide programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2341)|
| 0:39:07| and by us to guide programs as well to consider it a professional service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2347)|
| 0:39:11| And they did it last in 2008, and then before that they did it in 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2351)|
| 0:39:17| And they provide us with, they actually do the analysis of the data as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2357)|
| 0:39:22| Could you give me a little, a bit of an example of how you used the 2008 data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2362)|
| 0:39:28| to manage programs subsequent to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2368)|
| 0:39:33| This mainly looks at behaviors of adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2373)|
| 0:39:37| So are people smoking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| Are people being physically active?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2379)|
| 0:39:41| So using that information based on age or zip code data or income data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2381)|
| 0:39:49| we would try to target those higher risk groups who self-report more smoking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2389)|
| 0:39:55| than their peers or more inactivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2395)|
| 0:39:59| For instance, the diabetes grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| and choosing to target certain populations with activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2401)|
| 0:40:06| we used information from this to make those decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2406)|
| 0:40:09| about which groups are most at risk for inactivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2409)|
| 0:40:12| And again, it's self-reported data, so it's not, it's a good way to get information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2412)|
| 0:40:17| It's not, ideally we can't follow everybody around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2417)|
| 0:40:21| Okay, but our investment from the county is 58,008, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2421)|
| 0:40:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2425)|
| 0:40:26| That's what we put into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2426)|
| 0:40:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2428)|
| 0:40:29| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2429)|
| 0:40:30| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2430)|
| 0:40:31| I have a question on item 14, but on this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| it's been, the motion's been made and seconded to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2433)|
| 0:40:36| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2436)|
| 0:40:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2437)|
| 0:40:38| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2438)|
| 0:40:39| The motion's approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2439)|
| 0:40:40| On item 14, it's already been approved, Dr. Buchanan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2440)|
| 0:40:42| but you said the maximum liability was 40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2442)|
| 0:40:45| What's the maximum liability now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| Did you want to increase it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| They increased it from, let me find, sorry, let me find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2449)|
| 0:40:57| They increased it from $1,294,600 to $1,334,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2457)|
| 0:41:06| So it's an increase of 40,000, from $294,000 to $334,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2466)|
| 0:41:15| Okay, that was the only question I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| Okay, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2477)|
| 0:41:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2478)|
| 0:41:20| On the Midway situation, you have before you from the mayor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2480)|
| 0:41:25| the front page of the hearings that were conducted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2485)|
| 0:41:30| They have tabulated all of the comments that were made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2490)|
| 0:41:33| So you can see that you do not have the specific information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2493)|
| 0:41:40| the specific comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2500)|
| 0:41:42| It is a very lengthy document, and so we did not print one for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2502)|
| 0:41:46| We wanted to see who wanted one, and we will print those for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2506)|
| 0:41:50| We also have a copy in the commission office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2510)|
| 0:41:52| if you would like to go up and review that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2512)|
| 0:41:54| If the commissioners would like to have a copy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2514)|
| 0:41:56| we'll go ahead and make those because it came down this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| We didn't have time to get it to everybody by this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2518)|
| 0:42:01| John, is this available PDF form?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2521)|
| 0:42:04| Can we download this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2524)|
| 0:42:07| Do you think it will be available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2527)|
| 0:42:08| It should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| Here comes Dean Rice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| Sorry, Dean, I didn't see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| He's lost all that weight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2534)|
| 0:42:18| Dean Rice, 806 Meadowfield Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2538)|
| 0:42:20| There was some concern expressed by several constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2540)|
| 0:42:23| regarding the privacy of the e-mails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2543)|
| 0:42:26| because the initial e-mails had a requirement for the name and address fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2546)|
| 0:42:30| That was done so that we didn't have two people sitting around e-mailing 300 times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2550)|
| 0:42:36| It worked well, but several people expressed concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2556)|
| 0:42:39| The mayor appreciated those concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| and so what we did was printed them out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2561)|
| 0:42:43| and then we simply redacted the names and the addresses of each person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2563)|
| 0:42:49| leaving in the city as well as a zip code for verification of Knox County residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2569)|
| 0:42:54| Because of that, they are not online to just log in and get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2574)|
| 0:43:00| If you need them downloaded, we can look at scanning what we have into a PDF| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2580)|
| 0:43:05| and be able to supply that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2587)|
| 0:43:08| My technical savvy is you just heard it all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2588)|
| 0:43:11| so I need to check with our IT folks on the best way to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2591)|
| 0:43:17| How many pages is it, Dean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| Well, each comment is a separate page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2599)|
| 0:43:22| and so you're looking at 480 pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2602)|
| 0:43:25| So if any commissioner wants one, we're happy to provide them for you by making you a copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2605)|
| 0:43:30| If not, we'll send you information about a possible PDF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2610)|
| 0:43:33| There's also a copy in the commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| But if you want a copy, let Jolie know, and we'll be happy to make that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2615)|
| 0:43:38| I want to make sure I understand what you have here on the sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2618)|
| 0:43:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2620)|
| 0:43:41| You say total comments 480, opposition 172.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2621)|
| 0:43:44| Is that in opposition to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| In opposition to the sector plan, in opposition to the business park itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2626)|
| 0:43:53| Okay, in support of would be in support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| In support of the sector plan, in support of the business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2635)|
| 0:43:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2639)|
| 0:44:00| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2640)|
| 0:44:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| My request on today's agenda was not to discuss the Midway Road Park up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2644)|
| 0:44:11| I was needing to get information to commission from Dr. Terry Hilsman with USDA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2651)|
| 0:44:19| as it relates to an alternative to the development of that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2659)|
| 0:44:25| He is unavailable later on today because he has class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2665)|
| 0:44:28| He's unavailable in particular Monday evening because he has class that he's instructing at UT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2668)|
| 0:44:36| and I was just wanting to have him to be able to engage in dialogue with commissioners today if possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2676)|
| 0:44:45| Again, I want to be fair to everybody here because I know the nature of this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2685)|
| 0:44:51| Would it be possible for us to limit this discussion just to the doctor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2691)|
| 0:44:55| so he can present his without going into a lengthy discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2695)|
| 0:44:59| and having everyone come to the podium, et cetera, et cetera, but just limit it to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2699)|
| 0:45:03| Would that be acceptable to the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2703)|
| 0:45:06| Mr. Napier, again, I want to be fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2706)|
| 0:45:08| Is that okay with you if we just limited that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2708)|
| 0:45:11| Is that okay with commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2713)|
| 0:45:14| Is that okay with you, Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2714)|
| 0:45:15| Most certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2715)|
| 0:45:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2716)|
| 0:45:17| Then we're going to limit the discussion just to Dr. Hilsman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| So, Dr. Hilsman, if you'd like to come forward, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2719)|
| 0:45:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| If I might, so that people would know exactly where I stand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2725)|
| 0:45:29| I have used in my discussions of Midway Road over the years before my time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2729)|
| 0:45:37| because the sector plan revision or the introduction of Midway Road Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2737)|
| 0:45:44| has been, to the most part, before my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2744)|
| 0:45:50| The comment that I want to make about my pros and cons are not fit for today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2750)|
| 0:45:58| but the discussion that we need to have as commissioners come Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2758)|
| 0:46:04| has always revolved around the fact of whether or not there was something else we could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2764)|
| 0:46:11| There's the orange route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| Everyone knows it's an idea that has come and gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2774)|
| 0:46:17| To be even more specific, there's the farmer's market, something that has come and gone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2777)|
| 0:46:22| and this is one of those things, in my opinion, and I'm biased,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2782)|
| 0:46:28| Midway Road Industrial Park resides in that same category with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2788)|
| 0:46:36| So the thing that has never come before commission before has been we've just opposed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2796)|
| 0:46:42| I have just opposed it or Bud Armstrong or Phil Ballard or whoever has opposed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2802)|
| 0:46:48| But in those months and years that have come and passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2808)|
| 0:46:54| just within the last few weeks or month or so, there has been brought forward a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2814)|
| 0:47:00| which may help Knox County get away from the Midway Road development if we would look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2820)|
| 0:47:08| And to that end, Dr. Hilsman with USDA and also an instructor at the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2828)|
| 0:47:20| can you give us a thumbnail sketch of what you have presented to some of the people in the 8th District?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2840)|
| 0:47:27| Sir, if I could get your full name and address, please, for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2847)|
| 0:47:30| My name is Terran Hilsman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2850)|
| 0:47:31| My address is 3835 Miser Station Road in Louisville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2851)|
| 0:47:35| So I live in Blount County, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| Can everybody hear me okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2859)|
| 0:47:40| And also I would say that he, for USDA, he is Knox County and Sevier County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2860)|
| 0:47:47| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2867)|
| 0:47:49| Yes, with the Natural Resources Conservation Service, USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2869)|
| 0:47:55| And also, for the record, I don't instruct at the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2875)|
| 0:47:59| I'm an alumni of the University of Tennessee, but I teach at Tuscaloosa College.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2879)|
| 0:48:03| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2883)|
| 0:48:06| Yeah, that's the University of Tuscaloosa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2886)|
| 0:48:11| Did I say UT?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2891)|
| 0:48:12| Still UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2892)|
| 0:48:13| Give me a thumbnail sketch of the Farm and Ranch Land Protection Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2893)|
| 0:48:17| Yeah, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2897)|
| 0:48:18| I've been in this current position with the United States Department of Agriculture since 2003| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2898)|
| 0:48:24| here in Knox County and Sevier County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2904)|
| 0:48:27| And in the 2002 Farm Bill, our agency or our department authorized a program called the Farm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2907)|
| 0:48:35| and Ranch Land Protection Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2915)|
| 0:48:37| And essentially this is a program that the USDA decided to get involved in because of the United States| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2917)|
| 0:48:44| and I guess all of you are probably, well, maybe all of you are not aware of the fact that we're losing a lot of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2924)|
| 0:48:49| best farmland across the nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2929)|
| 0:48:51| So the USDA decided that they wanted to get involved and try to find a way to help private landowners protect some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2931)|
| 0:48:59| of these most important farmlands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| So this was authorized in the 2002 Farm Bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2941)|
| 0:49:04| It was reauthorized again in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2944)|
| 0:49:07| So it's a pretty popular program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2947)|
| 0:49:09| It gets broad support across a broad spectrum of congressmen and senators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2949)|
| 0:49:16| Nevertheless, in 2004 here in Knox County, that's when I first got involved with the Farm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2956)|
| 0:49:23| and Ranch Land Protection Program because before that time we had never had a farm in Tennessee that had participated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2963)|
| 0:49:30| in the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2970)|
| 0:49:31| And so out in the 8th District, and that's why I'm bringing all this up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2971)|
| 0:49:34| some of the folks with the French Broad Group and some of the people in that neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2974)|
| 0:49:39| or in that area of the county was interested in trying to protect a historical farm out in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2979)|
| 0:49:45| And so that's kind of how we got involved with the Farm and Ranch Land Protection Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2985)|
| 0:49:49| and that's how I kind of got associated with it in terms of that area of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2989)|
| 0:49:54| But anyway, the Farm and Ranch Land Protection Program, what it basically does is farm USDA, my agency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=2994)|
| 0:50:00| the Natural Resources Conservation Service, participates in a partnership effort with an eligible entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3000)|
| 0:50:09| And what an eligible entity is, it's like a land trust or an entity that is interested in preserving lands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3009)|
| 0:50:18| and holding and maintaining and managing easements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3018)|
| 0:50:21| So we partner with eligible entities to put conservation easements on private agricultural lands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3021)|
| 0:50:29| We put up to 50% of the value of that conservation easement value into this arrangement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3029)|
| 0:50:37| and, again, we partner with an eligible entity that actually holds and manages the easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3037)|
| 0:50:43| So we don't hold the easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3043)|
| 0:50:44| We don't manage it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| The owner of the property continues to own their farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3046)|
| 0:50:51| The federal government does not take ownership of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3051)|
| 0:50:54| The only thing that we do, I go out and work with the landowner to develop a conservation plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3054)|
| 0:51:00| for how the land will be used going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3060)|
| 0:51:04| But it is in perpetuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| Once this is done, it's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3066)|
| 0:51:08| It can't be reversed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3068)|
| 0:51:10| Obviously, eminent domain, there are ways that people have tried to fight it before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3070)|
| 0:51:15| but that's one of the reasons why the eligible entity is involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3075)|
| 0:51:19| The farm that I was describing before, the land trust for Tennessee out of Nashville actually has the conservation easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3079)|
| 0:51:27| on that particular property to cruise dairy out off the French Broad River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3087)|
| 0:51:33| It's their responsibility from now on to protect that easement so that if family members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3093)|
| 0:51:39| or if anybody ever tries to break the farm up, develop it X, Y, Z,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3099)|
| 0:51:44| then they would be the responsible entity for bringing lawyers and whatever you had to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3104)|
| 0:51:49| to make sure that the easement stays in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3109)|
| 0:51:54| That's just sort of a thumbnail sketch of the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3114)|
| 0:51:57| With this piece of property that I'll refer to as Midway Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3117)|
| 0:52:01| would it be an attractive applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3121)|
| 0:52:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3124)|
| 0:52:05| Again, one of the factors that played into when we enrolled the easement on the cruise farm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3125)|
| 0:52:13| was the possibility of getting additional tracts of land in the same watershed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3133)|
| 0:52:19| That's one of the things that you can get points for in the application is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3139)|
| 0:52:23| are there other protected lands in the adjoining region or in that same watershed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3143)|
| 0:52:29| So actually, the property there at Midway would be attractive from that standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3149)|
| 0:52:35| but also because it is eligible because it has the prime and unique soils that we look for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3155)|
| 0:52:41| on properties that we bring into the Farm and Ranch Land Protection Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3161)|
| 0:52:45| I think it's about 60 percent or more prime, locally important, statewide soils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3165)|
| 0:52:51| And that's really our only interest in the property at all or any property that we enroll in this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3171)|
| 0:52:57| It's because any properties that we put in the program have to meet a threshold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3177)|
| 0:53:02| in terms of the kinds of soils that they have on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| We won't take just any old kind of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3184)|
| 0:53:07| It has to be land that is productive for or that is good for ag production.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3187)|
| 0:53:13| So since one of the requirements that we as commissioners have set asking a question about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3193)|
| 0:53:20| is there an alternative to the current plan that's on the table to help Knox County get its money back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3200)|
| 0:53:26| Then, Dr. Hilsman, I ask you, is this a funded program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3206)|
| 0:53:29| Is this a program that is funded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3209)|
| 0:53:32| Yes. Again, the program was authorized in 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3212)|
| 0:53:36| I don't know exactly the figures, and again, it's reauthorized in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3216)|
| 0:53:42| So we have funding for this program through 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3222)|
| 0:53:46| Eligible entities can apply for the funding and go through the process to try to get the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3226)|
| 0:53:56| Dr. Hilsman, I thank you for being here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3236)|
| 0:53:59| My fellow commissioners, I appreciate your indulgence that we receive his few minutes of information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3239)|
| 0:54:07| and I guess he'd stand for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3247)|
| 0:54:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3249)|
| 0:54:10| Yes, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3250)|
| 0:54:12| Dr. Hilsman, when you talked about the 50 percent of the cost for the easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3252)|
| 0:54:18| how do you figure the easement, the loss, and potential revenue, and how do you figure that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3258)|
| 0:54:25| Yes, what we have to have is an appraisal from a state certified appraiser,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3265)|
| 0:54:32| and they're supposed to determine the market value of the property in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3272)|
| 0:54:37| And again, we would do this for any property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3277)|
| 0:54:41| And then they also have to determine what is the value of the property once the easement is placed on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3281)|
| 0:54:46| so once the development potential is taken off of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3286)|
| 0:54:51| which is what will happen if we put a conservation easement on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3291)|
| 0:54:55| And then the difference between those two numbers is the conservation easement value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3295)|
| 0:54:59| of which NRCS puts up 50 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3299)|
| 0:55:05| And it has to be the owner of the property that requests the USDA to step in, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3305)|
| 0:55:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3310)|
| 0:55:11| What happens is an eligible entity is making the application on behalf of an owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3311)|
| 0:55:16| And, yes, the owner has to be willing to put it in, to enroll it into the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3316)|
| 0:55:21| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3321)|
| 0:55:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3322)|
| 0:55:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3323)|
| 0:55:24| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3324)|
| 0:55:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3326)|
| 0:55:27| Thank you, Dr. Hilsman, for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3327)|
| 0:55:31| All that we've read on this since it came up a couple of weeks ago is the fact that this only works for privately owned property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3331)|
| 0:55:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| Well, this is not privately owned property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3341)|
| 0:55:43| I mean, it's not individually privately owned property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3343)|
| 0:55:47| Well, it doesn't have to be individually privately owned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3347)|
| 0:55:50| It can be owned by an entity that, as long as it's a nongovernmental entity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3350)|
| 0:55:55| there's a lot of different criteria that goes into how we determine ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3355)|
| 0:56:00| But it doesn't have to be a private landowner, one farm family, X, Y, Z.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3360)|
| 0:56:06| It can be an entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3366)|
| 0:56:07| They have to meet, but they would have to meet our criteria for ownership, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3367)|
| 0:56:12| Well, the development corporation is a government entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3372)|
| 0:56:19| So it doesn't qualify, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3379)|
| 0:56:21| If they are a government entity, no, they wouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3381)|
| 0:56:24| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3384)|
| 0:56:25| And also another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3385)|
| 0:56:26| You said that once it goes in this, it's in there forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3386)|
| 0:56:30| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3390)|
| 0:56:31| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3391)|
| 0:56:33| So it's going to be sitting there for now until eternity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3393)|
| 0:56:37| and all you can do is grow corn and beans on it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3397)|
| 0:56:40| You can't put houses on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3400)|
| 0:56:42| I mean, you can't build condos and subdivisions or business parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3402)|
| 0:56:49| It can't be developed in such a way that it takes away from the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3409)|
| 0:56:53| in other words, it can't be paved over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3413)|
| 0:56:55| The most productive farmland soils that we're trying to protect have to be maintained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3415)|
| 0:56:59| In other words, like, for instance, with the Cruz farm, and I'm just using this as an example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3419)|
| 0:57:04| and I know they wouldn't mind if I did so, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3424)|
| 0:57:07| they had some plans in terms of how they wanted to expand their agricultural operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3427)|
| 0:57:12| and some of the things they wanted to do out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3432)|
| 0:57:14| maybe put a store where they were going to sell some of their agricultural products.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3434)|
| 0:57:18| All those kinds of things can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3438)|
| 0:57:21| You know, you can put more buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| There are a certain number of houses they wanted to put on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3443)|
| 0:57:26| because they had family members that wanted to live there, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3446)|
| 0:57:29| maybe down the road or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3449)|
| 0:57:31| All those kinds of things are worked out between the USDA, which is my agency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3451)|
| 0:57:37| the eligible entity that will hold the easement, and then the owners of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3457)|
| 0:57:42| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3462)|
| 0:57:43| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3463)|
| 0:57:45| Yes, I had, you know, this is something that I think confuses a lot of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3465)|
| 0:57:49| and thank you very much, by the way, Dr. Hilsman, for coming down here and explaining this to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3469)|
| 0:57:54| But is the Development Corporation a government entity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3474)|
| 0:58:08| Not per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3488)|
| 0:58:09| In other words, it's not a public entity, but it is a combination of public-private partnerships,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3489)|
| 0:58:16| but it can't sue or be sued as a public entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3496)|
| 0:58:18| It can't condemn property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3498)|
| 0:58:20| So it is a bit of a hybrid, but not specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3500)|
| 0:58:24| The second comment I had is that, and I think Dave made the statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3504)|
| 0:58:28| that how can Knox County get its money back out of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3508)|
| 0:58:33| Knox County doesn't have a lot of money in this right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3513)|
| 0:58:36| I mean, yes, there was $10 million spent on the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3516)|
| 0:58:40| but that money was taken from other land that was, you know, it's not like we had a bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3520)|
| 0:58:45| It's not like the county took out a loan that added to the county debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3525)|
| 0:58:49| The funds that the land was purchased with were purchased with profits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3529)|
| 0:58:54| that the Development Corporation made from selling other land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3534)|
| 0:58:59| And the only, I guess you'd say, financial interest that Knox County has in the Development Corporation is we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3539)|
| 0:59:07| you know, we allocate $900,000 a year, if you go back and check our budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3547)|
| 0:59:11| to the Development Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3551)|
| 0:59:15| But my understanding is that's not for purchasing land or developing land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3555)|
| 0:59:19| It's for maintaining land or operations to pay salaries of their full-time people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3559)|
| 0:59:25| So we contribute $900,000 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3565)|
| 0:59:28| but it doesn't change that we're going to be using taxpayer dollars to either purchase the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3568)|
| 0:59:34| which already has been done, or develop the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3574)|
| 0:59:37| which they have money for already with income they've received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3577)|
| 0:59:43| or revenue, I should say, that they've received from selling other land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3583)|
| 0:59:49| And the third point I wanted to make dealt with saying there had to be a willing owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3589)|
| 0:59:55| And right now the Development Corporation is the owner of this land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3595)|
| 1:00:01| and I don't know what their position would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| but I have an idea they wouldn't be a willing seller to put this into a trust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3603)|
| 1:00:11| or a conservation situation like this because I think they would rather develop the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3611)|
| 1:00:18| Well, again, my agency, and nor I as a representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3618)|
| 1:00:23| are coming to you as the commission and asking you to enroll any property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3623)|
| 1:00:27| Certainly I don't have a stance on this one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3627)|
| 1:00:31| Whatever you guys decide to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3631)|
| 1:00:34| Only I'm here to do is explain the program and answer questions about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3634)|
| 1:00:38| and to let you know that if this is something that you guys decide as a body that you want to pursue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3638)|
| 1:00:46| then I'm happy to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3646)|
| 1:00:48| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3648)|
| 1:00:49| I know you're not trying to sell the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3649)|
| 1:00:51| You're just telling us that this program is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3651)|
| 1:00:53| But the point I was trying to make to the commission members is that Knox County does not own the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3653)|
| 1:00:59| The development corporation owns the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| and they would have to be the owner that would agree to put it in the conservatory like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3661)|
| 1:01:09| and I think that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3669)|
| 1:01:11| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| Thank you, Chairman, and thank you, Dr. Hilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| Run through the math again, if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3675)|
| 1:01:19| It's appraised by an independent professional appraiser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3679)|
| 1:01:23| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3683)|
| 1:01:24| And then what does that number compare to or subtract it from or add it to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3684)|
| 1:01:29| Well, let me give you an example that might help clear it up some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3689)|
| 1:01:32| Let's say that there was a piece of property and the market value of that property was $10,000 an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3692)|
| 1:01:39| Just an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3699)|
| 1:01:42| And our appraiser said this property today is worth $10,000 an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3702)|
| 1:01:46| And then they done another appraisal with a conservation easement like the one that we're talking about here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3706)|
| 1:01:53| is put onto the property and they said as farmland, which is all it would be worth at that point, it's only worth $2,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3713)|
| 1:02:00| Well, that's a difference of $8,000 between two and ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3720)|
| 1:02:05| And my agency puts up half of that $8,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3725)|
| 1:02:10| And so $4,000 per acre is what we would contribute to this arrangement if the application were successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3730)|
| 1:02:17| And then there would be another 25% that would come from the eligible entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3737)|
| 1:02:23| From the eligible entity, that being the development corp or a?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3743)|
| 1:02:27| That would be from the eligible entity making the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3747)|
| 1:02:32| The person, the group, the entity, the land trust, the what have you that would be making the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3752)|
| 1:02:38| That would be the entity that is not involved in the process as we speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3758)|
| 1:02:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3763)|
| 1:02:44| Yeah, I think what he's saying is that somebody has made application on behalf of the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3764)|
| 1:02:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3771)|
| 1:02:52| And that entity, if I understand it, they would have to put up a quarter of the funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3772)|
| 1:02:56| Let's say it's the Friends of the Smoky Mountains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3776)|
| 1:02:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3779)|
| 1:03:00| They would put up, you know, it's usually a non-profit conservation group and they would put up those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3780)|
| 1:03:05| I think that's what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3785)|
| 1:03:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3786)|
| 1:03:07| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3787)|
| 1:03:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3788)|
| 1:03:09| And one final, I'm thinking of a couple of months back, and we're still talking about safety center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3789)|
| 1:03:15| we had a, we were all ready to get this federal dollar for the safety center and move forward with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3795)|
| 1:03:22| We had a guy say, I mean, you're not going to get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3802)|
| 1:03:25| So my question is, what are the chances that those monies would be forthcoming from the USDA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3805)|
| 1:03:31| You know, we're talking about earmarks not going forward and things like that in Washington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3811)|
| 1:03:35| Is that a pretty good 90% chance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3815)|
| 1:03:38| Well, I'll say this, I can't give you any guarantee in terms of how it would play out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3818)|
| 1:03:43| It's an application process that takes some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3823)|
| 1:03:46| I mean, it would need to start, you know, now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3826)|
| 1:03:49| And it would go through the spring and it would probably be about May or June before, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3829)|
| 1:03:53| you would know whether or not it was successful or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3833)|
| 1:03:56| As far as where the money, the money, again, it was approved in the 08 Farm Bill, which is a six-year farm bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3836)|
| 1:04:02| It goes through 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3842)|
| 1:04:04| Now, that doesn't mean that, you know, that congressmen or senators couldn't decide to pool that money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3844)|
| 1:04:09| and send it somewhere else and, you know, I can't really speak to how that would happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3849)|
| 1:04:14| But for right now, it is in the Farm Bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3854)|
| 1:04:16| It is authorized for this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3856)|
| 1:04:18| Is there a lot of competition for the money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3858)|
| 1:04:20| In Tennessee, there is very little, to be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3860)|
| 1:04:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3863)|
| 1:04:24| Well, thank you for presenting us with this alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3864)|
| 1:04:27| Glad to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3867)|
| 1:04:28| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3868)|
| 1:04:29| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3869)|
| 1:04:31| This is on the agenda for Monday and I expect a lively discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3871)|
| 1:04:36| But one of the things that I will be asking on Monday is are you prepared to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3876)|
| 1:04:40| If you are not going to be prepared to vote on Monday, then do we want to enter into the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3880)|
| 1:04:44| or perhaps have a work session?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3884)|
| 1:04:46| Again, I'm just throwing out things to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3886)|
| 1:04:48| If you are ready to vote, then let's move ahead and let's hear all the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3888)|
| 1:04:52| So, Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3892)|
| 1:04:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3894)|
| 1:04:55| I believe it be at this time we interject that zonings are at 5 o'clock Monday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3895)|
| 1:05:00| 5 o'clock instead of 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3900)|
| 1:05:01| Yeah, 5 o'clock Monday instead of 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3901)|
| 1:05:05| Mr. Shumpert is here and I want to be respectful of you folks' time coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3905)|
| 1:05:08| If it's okay with the Commission, we'll move to that item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3908)|
| 1:05:12| Commissioner Norman, I believe you had asked for this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3912)|
| 1:05:14| Would you like to give us a briefing on what this discussion item is about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3914)|
| 1:05:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3917)|
| 1:05:18| Yeah, Tommy or Doug, whoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3918)|
| 1:05:21| Would you all just explain how this is necessary for the county to receive this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3921)|
| 1:05:28| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3928)|
| 1:05:29| Tommy Shumpert, 5300 Oak Glade Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3929)|
| 1:05:36| We've got a deal for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3936)|
| 1:05:41| Legacy Park has purchased two tracks of property around $800,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3941)|
| 1:05:51| one track in Halls and one track in South Knoxville across the river from the Seven Islands Wildlife Refuge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3951)|
| 1:06:03| And we're trying to transfer the property to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3963)|
| 1:06:07| And I'm not here to try to explain the legal parts exactly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3967)|
| 1:06:12| but the main thing you're doing, if you accept this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3972)|
| 1:06:16| you are taking some risk because both pieces of property have a conservation easement on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3976)|
| 1:06:25| which means as long as you maintain the property as parkland, everybody's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3985)|
| 1:06:33| If you decide to change the use of that property, we're going to sue you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3993)|
| 1:06:39| And you're going to pay our legal fee if we win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=3999)|
| 1:06:43| Now, that's the risk you take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4003)|
| 1:06:46| And people in the Halls community in South Knoxville has contributed for this property to have a park in Halls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4006)|
| 1:06:57| and to help in the Seven Islands project where South Knoxville would be just a walking bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4017)|
| 1:07:03| away from all the property in East Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4023)|
| 1:07:07| That is, in my terms, the layman issue before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4027)|
| 1:07:16| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4036)|
| 1:07:18| Thank you, Tommy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4038)|
| 1:07:19| Tommy or Doug, you're the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4039)|
| 1:07:20| Have we ever done this before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4040)|
| 1:07:22| Well, we did a lot of the Seven Islands project when I was in office, basically with a conservation easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4042)|
| 1:07:29| I can't say that all the legal things are exactly the same, but the basic idea is the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4049)|
| 1:07:36| Where we have a conservation easement on all the property in East Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4056)|
| 1:07:42| where we purchased about 100 acres and put all the property together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4062)|
| 1:07:47| Mr. Law Director, would you answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4067)|
| 1:07:49| And I think Doug can give us more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4069)|
| 1:07:51| Yes, Doug Battelle, Senior Director of Parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4071)|
| 1:07:54| And we do have other pieces, too, we've accepted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4074)|
| 1:07:56| The largest one to think of that has a deed restriction on it is all the TVA property on the waterfront,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4076)|
| 1:08:01| which is about 19 different parcels, about 1,000 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4081)|
| 1:08:05| And that's deed restriction from TVA that, again, if we do something outside public recreation on our property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4085)|
| 1:08:11| TVA would come in, solve the problem, send us the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4091)|
| 1:08:15| So a similar situation in terms of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4095)|
| 1:08:17| we obviously don't want to use a piece of property that's been given to us in a fashion it was not intended for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4097)|
| 1:08:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4102)|
| 1:08:23| Mr. Law Director, you see any problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4103)|
| 1:08:24| The only one I wanted to make sure about, as I mentioned to Doug,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4104)|
| 1:08:27| members of the commission, is there is some indemnification language that does require that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4107)|
| 1:08:32| If, in fact, we do have a litigation issue, we have to indemnify the grantor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4112)|
| 1:08:37| Now, the Attorney General has said that those can be void as per public policy, and that's the rub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4117)|
| 1:08:45| It's a policy decision that you're going to have to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4125)|
| 1:08:47| I couldn't agree to that language outside of the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4127)|
| 1:08:51| So, as Mr. Shumpert said quite articulately, there is some risk in taking this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4131)|
| 1:08:57| I also know it's tied to a grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4137)|
| 1:09:00| Looking at it, I don't, you know, you can't predict, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4140)|
| 1:09:04| in a litigious society whether or not this will ever come to litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4144)|
| 1:09:07| Probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4147)|
| 1:09:08| But, again, the commission should make a public finding that this is for public policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4148)|
| 1:09:14| this is beneficial to the public, and as such you want to go forward with the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4154)|
| 1:09:19| I just want to take the time, you know, and I'll call you coach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4159)|
| 1:09:23| Coach, I appreciate what you've done in raising these monies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4163)|
| 1:09:27| Mr. Shumpert, you've raised quite a bit of money, $800,000 over what, three or four year period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4167)|
| 1:09:32| And I know Carol Evans, that was Carol's, her job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4172)|
| 1:09:35| I see Scott Frith back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4175)|
| 1:09:36| Scott was on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4176)|
| 1:09:37| But just when economic times are what they are and what not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4177)|
| 1:09:41| and you all have raised $800,000 of private money, it's just, it shows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4181)|
| 1:09:47| I will make one correction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4187)|
| 1:09:49| You've raised $800,000 except for $75,000 that the county of Knox contributed to the Halls property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4189)|
| 1:09:58| Yeah, you're correct on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4198)|
| 1:10:00| But I appreciate your leadership in doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4200)|
| 1:10:02| And both pieces of property are just great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4202)|
| 1:10:04| And I'm really excited about that in the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4204)|
| 1:10:06| Knoxville, that Seven Island Bridge, I've seen design work on that, and it's going to be really great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4206)|
| 1:10:11| So I think it's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4211)|
| 1:10:13| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4213)|
| 1:10:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4215)|
| 1:10:18| In doing this, it makes it, these two properties, just like any other county park, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4218)|
| 1:10:26| Well, let me just say, I will say there is some risk in the fact that on most county parks, you can change the use of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4226)|
| 1:10:39| On these two, we're saying if you do change the use of it, you're going to be sued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4239)|
| 1:10:46| From a liability standpoint, they're the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4246)|
| 1:10:50| I don't really see a problem in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4250)|
| 1:10:52| And from what I understand, you have to have something in hand by the end of the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4252)|
| 1:10:59| Can this wait until Monday for a vote, or do we need to do something today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4259)|
| 1:11:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4264)|
| 1:11:06| We hope you're putting on that fast track part for Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4266)|
| 1:11:10| What do you call that, the consent agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4270)|
| 1:11:13| That's what we would request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4273)|
| 1:11:15| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4275)|
| 1:11:17| We haven't had any motion at all on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4277)|
| 1:11:19| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4279)|
| 1:11:20| I would like to echo the sentiments of Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4280)|
| 1:11:26| But my question is, if I support whatever it is we're going to vote on, does that mean that you'll get back out there and raise $900,000 more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4286)|
| 1:11:35| No commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4295)|
| 1:11:37| Okay, I take that as a commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4297)|
| 1:11:39| I would be in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4299)|
| 1:11:41| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4301)|
| 1:11:42| We don't have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4302)|
| 1:11:43| I'd like to make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4303)|
| 1:11:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4305)|
| 1:11:46| Motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4306)|
| 1:11:47| Commissioner Smith, do you have something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4307)|
| 1:11:49| Second the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4309)|
| 1:11:51| Question on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4311)|
| 1:11:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4312)|
| 1:11:53| As former Mayor, Executive Schumpeter said, if this is approved, does this go on the consent for Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4313)|
| 1:12:00| Yes, we would, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4320)|
| 1:12:01| Unless somebody pulls it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4321)|
| 1:12:03| Unless somebody pulls it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4323)|
| 1:12:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4324)|

| 1:12:11| On page five, item 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4331)|
| 1:12:16| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4336)|
| 1:12:19| authorizing the expenditure of $20,000 from the Public Improvement Fund for renovations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4339)|
| 1:12:24| to the proposed office space on the first floor of the Midway Rehabilitation Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4344)|
| 1:12:29| which the Knox County Drug Court desires to relocate its operations, resolution 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4349)|
| 1:12:35| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4355)|
| 1:12:38| To get the discussion going, I'll make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4358)|
| 1:12:40| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4360)|
| 1:12:41| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4361)|
| 1:12:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4362)|
| 1:12:43| Motion to be made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4363)|
| 1:12:44| Commissioner Andrews?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4364)|
| 1:12:45| I'd like, before Monday, I would like, since the Drug Court is wanting to spend this money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4365)|
| 1:12:51| I'd like to know what their retrieval of court fees and things are come Monday, before we meet Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4371)|
| 1:12:59| I think we have, for a county our size, we have a fairly low retrieval rate of court costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4379)|
| 1:13:04| and I would like to see what the Drug Court's retrieval on court costs are Monday before we vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4384)|
| 1:13:09| Judge Baumgartner is in charge of the Drug Court, so we'll send out a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4389)|
| 1:13:16| Jolie, if you would do that, just send him a formal request asking him to be at the Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4396)|
| 1:13:20| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4400)|
| 1:13:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4402)|
| 1:13:23| I'd also like to just, if whoever is going to present on Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4403)|
| 1:13:28| and I would like some kind of presentation on what's our lease costs, what are we paying, why are we doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4408)|
| 1:13:36| what kind of, again, I keep using that word, what kind of efficiencies are to be had by locating this where it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4416)|
| 1:13:44| or, you know, I don't know a lot about it, so I'd like to hear more about it before I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4424)|
| 1:13:51| Can I make a substitute motion to move without recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4431)|
| 1:13:53| That would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4433)|
| 1:13:55| So motion is to move without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4435)|
| 1:13:57| And, again, Jolie, if you would draft a letter to Judge Baumgartner, I'll be happy to sign it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4437)|
| 1:14:02| or you can sign in my place and send it to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4442)|
| 1:14:05| If I could, Mr. Chairman, just before the vote, not to influence that, but just this has been around for a while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4445)|
| 1:14:11| and all of the resolutions building up to this consistently read that the Commission would not be required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4451)|
| 1:14:19| to contribute any monies to this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4459)|
| 1:14:22| So this 20,000 is new, and it appears to be for the use and benefit of a private entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4462)|
| 1:14:29| So I just, I think we should, you know, I haven't been given a lot of information on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4469)|
| 1:14:33| but this is something I think the Commission does need to know on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4473)|
| 1:14:37| This looks like it's to actually modify or improve a private entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4477)|
| 1:14:43| Now, whether or not the Commission feels there's enough leap to say it still satisfies a public purpose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4483)|
| 1:14:48| I think it is important that the Commission is proactively seeking more information on Monday on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4488)|
| 1:14:54| So the motion is to send it on without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4494)|
| 1:14:57| Is there a new director for the Drug Court appointed yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4497)|
| 1:15:01| Is JJ still in here? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4501)|
| 1:15:04| I don't know. I just know that Judge Baumgartner is in charge of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4504)|
| 1:15:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4507)|
| 1:15:08| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4508)|
| 1:15:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4509)|

| 1:16:02| as amended on first reading ordinance 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4562)|
| 1:16:04| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4564)|
| 1:16:05| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4565)|
| 1:16:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4566)|
| 1:16:07| Motion made and seconded by Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4567)|
| 1:16:10| Would you give us a briefing on what this ordinance does with regards to the swimming pools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4570)|
| 1:16:15| Thank you. Mark Donaldson with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4575)|
| 1:16:17| This is in response to discussion that Knox County BZA and several commissioners had with regard to swimming pools in the backyards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4577)|
| 1:16:29| particularly for homes on the periphery of planned residential zone districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4589)|
| 1:16:37| It spread from that specific discussion to swimming pools in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4597)|
| 1:16:43| In talking with Roy in the back just today, he suggested some alternative language in that table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4603)|
| 1:16:50| which is at the bottom of Exhibit A, that we did not consider at the MPC level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4610)|
| 1:17:01| If that alternative language is to be considered by the commission, it needs to go back to the planning commission first before it comes back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4621)|
| 1:17:12| Generally, we just tried to get proper definitions into the code with regard to swimming pools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4632)|
| 1:17:17| and in doing that, noticed that there weren't definitions for such things as accessory structures and lot coverage and some other terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4637)|
| 1:17:28| so we took the opportunity to define those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4648)|
| 1:17:31| We proposed changing some of the language in the planned residential zone district with regard to the periphery boundary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4651)|
| 1:17:41| which was kind of the original genesis of the discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4661)|
| 1:17:47| in which it said all buildings or structures shall be set back from the boundary unless adjacent to a planned residential zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4667)|
| 1:17:55| We struck planned residential zoning and listed all of the residential zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4675)|
| 1:18:00| so that the rest of the phrase then gives the planning commission the ability to adjust that peripheral setback in those situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4680)|
| 1:18:11| Roy and I had discussed the specific setbacks for a swimming pool from other buildings, wells, septic tanks, and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4691)|
| 1:18:23| He wants to make that refer to either the building code or the health code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4703)|
| 1:18:29| In our original consideration, we considered only those specific dimensions that are in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4709)|
| 1:18:39| The argument is that if the building code and health codes change, then we don't have to change the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4719)|
| 1:18:45| but if we want to pursue that, we need to take that back to the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4725)|
| 1:18:50| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4730)|
| 1:18:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4732)|
| 1:18:55| I've talked to a couple of members of the BZA and spent some time last week with Roy and a couple of people up in his department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4735)|
| 1:19:06| And, you know, I don't think we need to be trying to reinvent the wheel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4746)|
| 1:19:11| We have experts there in the building codes department that have done this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4751)|
| 1:19:16| Roy's been there 21 years, 22 and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4756)|
| 1:19:21| The other gentleman was up there, too, in years as far as experience with this type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4761)|
| 1:19:28| I think we need to look at what their recommendations are because they've been dealing with it for 20-plus years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4768)|
| 1:19:38| Mr. Donaldson mentioned Exhibit A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4778)|
| 1:19:40| I'm not sure that everybody's got the same Exhibit A that I have because I think Roy only sent it to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4780)|
| 1:19:49| But Mark did mention a couple of things on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4789)|
| 1:19:54| Do you all have that chart when he talks about the different categories?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4794)|
| 1:20:05| The three first ones were principal or accessory building without a basement, referred to building codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4805)|
| 1:20:10| And I would agree with them in there that if the codes need to be changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4810)|
| 1:20:14| there's no use to have to go all through all this again if the building codes department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4814)|
| 1:20:19| whether it's a state, national or whatever, says it needs to be changed and they agree to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4819)|
| 1:20:23| then that's what it needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4823)|
| 1:20:25| The law is the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4825)|
| 1:20:27| The principal or accessory building with a basement, building codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4827)|
| 1:20:31| Accessory structure with a building code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4831)|
| 1:20:33| Over an electric or gas line, not allowed because that's the same as what it was before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4833)|
| 1:20:38| The big thing that's been the bugaboo with BZA is the side and rear property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4838)|
| 1:20:48| In agricultural, it doesn't make as much difference as it does in a subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4848)|
| 1:20:54| because generally in agriculture you've got bigger lots, bigger pieces of land, sometimes acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4854)|
| 1:21:00| and it doesn't matter if you set it back to the maximum as far as your back line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4860)|
| 1:21:05| But they have recommended 15 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4865)|
| 1:21:10| I'm sorry, 10 feet on side and rear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4870)|
| 1:21:16| That's in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4876)|
| 1:21:17| The PR is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4877)|
| 1:21:18| But the codes department feels like that needs to be 8 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4878)|
| 1:21:24| If it's more than 90 feet from the front property line, it could go down as far as 5 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4884)|
| 1:21:31| I mean, these are things that they have worked with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4891)|
| 1:21:35| So I think we need to take their expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4895)|
| 1:21:37| So I would like to make a substitute motion that we send this back to MPC with the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4897)|
| 1:21:45| from the codes department for each of these items in this chart to consider and bring back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4905)|
| 1:21:54| Is there a second to the substitute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4914)|
| 1:21:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4915)|
| 1:21:57| Do you have a substitute motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4917)|
| 1:21:58| Commissioner Smith, do you wish to address it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4918)|
| 1:22:00| Yes, that's what I was going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4920)|
| 1:22:01| So the substitute motion is to send it back to codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4921)|
| 1:22:06| With the recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4926)|
| 1:22:07| With the recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4927)|
| 1:22:08| Give serious consideration to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4928)|
| 1:22:11| Actually send it back to MPC using the codes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4931)|
| 1:22:16| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4936)|
| 1:22:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4937)|

| 1:22:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4961)|
| 1:22:42| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4962)|
| 1:22:43| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4963)|
| 1:22:44| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4964)|
| 1:22:47| No, we don't need to do zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4967)|
| 1:22:48| We'll do that on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4968)|
| 1:22:50| I know that Commissioner Owen B. had a seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4970)|
| 1:22:53| Commissioner Owen B., you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4973)|
| 1:22:56| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4976)|
| 1:22:57| I just wanted to give a briefing on the community television committee that met November 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4977)|
| 1:23:07| And their main concern was the live feed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4987)|
| 1:23:12| They got a lot of negative feedback from that based on not being able to hear the microphones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=4992)|
| 1:23:20| You're talking about at Fulton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5000)|
| 1:23:21| Yeah, when we had our meeting at the workshop at Fulton, they made a suggestion that if we're going to do these in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5001)|
| 1:23:31| which I agree we need to do these, we need to get out in the public more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5011)|
| 1:23:36| that we contract with Broadway Sound or somebody like that to get better microphones that can pick up a little better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5016)|
| 1:23:44| because it is so hard to hear in some of these auditoriums that we're going to be into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5024)|
| 1:23:49| And I told them that I would bring that back to the Fulton mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5029)|
| 1:23:54| We can decide from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5034)|
| 1:23:56| Other than that, that was the only concern, really, that they had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5036)|
| 1:23:59| They got a lot of negative feedback about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5039)|
| 1:24:02| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5042)|
| 1:24:03| They did use Broadway Sound, by the way, at Fulton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5043)|
| 1:24:05| But I think the more preparation, we could have done a better job with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5045)|
| 1:24:09| But at Farragut, the town hall, they're already set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5049)|
| 1:24:12| They have a room like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5052)|
| 1:24:13| And it's already mic'd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5053)|
| 1:24:14| It's already set up for TV feeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5054)|
| 1:24:16| It's a smaller version of this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| But it is for the Board of Mayor and Aldermen, their zonings, their planning commissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5058)|
| 1:24:22| So there would be no issue there if we chose to go down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5062)|
| 1:24:25| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5065)|
| 1:24:26| I just wanted to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5066)|
| 1:24:27| Some of that may have been our own fault at Fulton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5067)|
| 1:24:30| And I think I was one of the guilty parties where literally you had to be up very close to the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5070)|
| 1:24:37| I mean, it was being projected adequately within the auditorium because we could hear each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5077)|
| 1:24:44| But I think maybe we had to be closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5084)|
| 1:24:46| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5086)|
| 1:24:47| That wasn't the problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5087)|
| 1:24:48| Not for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5088)|
| 1:24:49| You're sitting in a line like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5089)|
| 1:24:50| I could not hear what was going on the other end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5090)|
| 1:24:52| That's why I moved out front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5092)|
| 1:24:54| Well, anyway, for the television, that may have been part of the problem, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5094)|
| 1:24:59| Part of it may have been the limitation of the type of mic or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5099)|
| 1:25:05| I don't know, but that would be something we need to investigate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5105)|
| 1:25:09| There was also a lighting issue with local TV stations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5109)|
| 1:25:12| Couldn't get good lighting there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5112)|
| 1:25:14| Yeah, they said that they could hear if you were speaking at the podium, they could hear you fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5114)|
| 1:25:19| That mic seemed to pick up better than the ones at the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5119)|
| 1:25:22| You almost had to stick it down your throat in order to be able to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5122)|
| 1:25:28| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5128)|
| 1:25:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5130)|
| 1:25:32| This is sort of something I didn't speak about a moment ago, but something was said about zonings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5132)|
| 1:25:40| and I need to get a clarification in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5140)|
| 1:25:43| At the last meeting, we had one that was deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5143)|
| 1:25:45| If we do not have someone to appear before us for two months in a row on zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5145)|
| 1:25:52| is that zoning going to be dropped?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5152)|
| 1:25:55| Yeah, that was basically what we said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5155)|
| 1:25:57| I think the rule used to be that if they didn't show up for zoning, it was just denied and it went away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5157)|
| 1:26:05| But now we're going to defer for one month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5165)|
| 1:26:07| Us giving them that one month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5167)|
| 1:26:09| The second month, they're going to be dropped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5169)|
| 1:26:10| Yeah, they're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5170)|
| 1:26:11| That's the way I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5171)|
| 1:26:12| I want to make sure everyone heard that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5172)|
| 1:26:15| That's up to the chairman, but we've deferred all those for a month just to get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5175)|
| 1:26:18| Have we sent a letter to the individuals making sure they know that they're going to be here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5178)|
| 1:26:21| Yes, Mr. Donaldson was going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5181)|
| 1:26:25| A couple of other points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5185)|
| 1:26:26| One, I'd like to thank Menvilla for having lunch for the commission today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5186)|
| 1:26:31| Not everyone was there, but for those of us that were there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5191)|
| 1:26:34| I think it was an opening experience on the part of Menvilla,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5194)|
| 1:26:38| and I thank them for lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5198)|
| 1:26:45| A second thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5205)|
| 1:26:46| Really, I've got three things here to mention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5206)|
| 1:26:48| The second one was the Christmas parade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5208)|
| 1:26:52| I wish to thank the city of Knoxville for inviting us as county commissioners to be in their Christmas parade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5212)|
| 1:27:00| and by far, I think it to be the largest gathering of people that I've ever seen on downtown Gay Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5220)|
| 1:27:06| Jackson, or central in the old city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5226)|
| 1:27:09| So it was, I think, a terrific time had by all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5229)|
| 1:27:12| And then the last thing I was going to mention was I was invited to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5232)|
| 1:27:17| and went as a reader on the Three Rivers Rambler little Christmas story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5237)|
| 1:27:25| They're still looking for celebrity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5245)|
| 1:27:29| Oh, we're not celebrities though, aren't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5249)|
| 1:27:32| They're still looking for people to read the story on the train,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5252)|
| 1:27:35| so if anyone's interested in doing that, you need to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5255)|
| 1:27:38| because the Three Rivers Rambler goes into the 8th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5258)|
| 1:27:43| and you need to see the scenic properties contained therein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5263)|
| 1:27:48| You are a celebrity on the train though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5268)|
| 1:27:50| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5270)|
| 1:27:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5271)|
| 1:27:52| Proof positive that commissioners can read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5272)|
| 1:27:55| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5275)|
| 1:27:56| Mr. Chairman, I asked last month to get some of the unused properties that we have from the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5276)|
| 1:28:01| and I don't know if they sent that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5281)|
| 1:28:02| Jolie said that they've not got that from them yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5282)|
| 1:28:05| Purchasing was going to get that to us, and I was trying to get purchasing before he got gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5285)|
| 1:28:10| Willie, could you send out another memo from me asking that that commission's wish is to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5290)|
| 1:28:17| And get it to all the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5297)|
| 1:28:19| Thank you, Jolie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5299)|
| 1:28:21| Commissioner Norman, do you have anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5301)|
| 1:28:23| No, just I like that zoning's at 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5303)|
| 1:28:26| I hope we can keep doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5306)|
| 1:28:28| Let me also mention to you that next month or next Monday we start our new schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5308)|
| 1:28:33| We'll have the luncheon, and then we go into session at 1 o'clock with beer board, 145.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5313)|
| 1:28:39| We will have any honorariums as well as public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5319)|
| 1:28:42| 2 o'clock we'll go into our regular business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5322)|
| 1:28:45| You will notice that the agenda looks different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5325)|
| 1:28:48| Items are numbered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5328)|
| 1:28:49| We don't have duplicates of resolutions and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5329)|
| 1:28:52| You will have an asterisk beside those that are on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5332)|
| 1:28:55| If we take it off consent, we'll just mark out the asterisk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5335)|
| 1:28:58| And so hopefully it will save on paper but also be easier to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5338)|
| 1:29:02| At that meeting, what time do you want the devotion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5342)|
| 1:29:06| 2 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5346)|
| 1:29:07| 2 o'clock, okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5347)|
| 1:29:08| Also, for the chairman's lunch, I mentioned Joe Carsello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5348)|
| 1:29:12| I've invited him to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5352)|
| 1:29:13| I will be inviting Ryan Haynes to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5353)|
| 1:29:16| Ryan will be the new chairman of the legislative delegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5356)|
| 1:29:18| I'd like to have some discussion with him about how we can better communicate with him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5358)|
| 1:29:23| on things that happen in Nashville that directly affect Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5363)|
| 1:29:27| Also, I'm asking Mr. Troy, I've already talked to Mr. Troy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5367)|
| 1:29:29| to come to talk about budgeting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5369)|
| 1:29:32| And as we talk about the commission budget for next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5372)|
| 1:29:34| I'd like to have some discussion about how we do those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5374)|
| 1:29:37| So that will probably take us about an hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5377)|
| 1:29:39| and then we'll come in and get ready for beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5379)|
| 1:29:41| Any other items or business to come before this commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5381)|
| 1:29:45| If not, we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5385)|
| 1:29:46| See Tony on TV at the ball again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5386)|
| 1:29:49| Bill Nova?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5389)|
| 1:29:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws101206?start=5393)|
