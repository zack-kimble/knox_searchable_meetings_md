| 0:00:29| Welcome everyone to the August Planning Commission Agenda Review meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=29)|
| 0:00:34| At this time, I will turn it over to Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=34)|
| 0:00:38| Good morning everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=38)|
| 0:00:40| Can everyone hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=40)|
| 0:00:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=43)|
| 0:00:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=44)|
| 0:00:45| Just a few updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=45)|
| 0:00:47| They're mainly associated with some staffing changes that we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=47)|
| 0:00:51| We've had a few additional staff transitions in recent weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=51)|
| 0:00:54| We've said goodbye to a couple staff, we've welcomed a new addition, and we've promoted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=54)|
| 0:00:59| a few staff into leadership roles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=59)|
| 0:01:02| So Ellen Zaviska, some of you may or may not know her, but she's been, had been with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=62)|
| 0:01:08| agency for almost 18 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=68)|
| 0:01:10| She was a planner in our transportation group, and she has left to pursue an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=70)|
| 0:01:15| with the Association of Metropolitan Planning Organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=75)|
| 0:01:18| Ellen, some of you may recall, really had a passion for safety for all roadway users,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=78)|
| 0:01:23| and she really did a lot of data analysis and took a leadership role around safe routes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=83)|
| 0:01:28| to school, and she spent a lot of time engaging across city and county departments as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=88)|
| 0:01:36| as across the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=96)|
| 0:01:37| So we're really going to miss her and her contributions to our work, but we're really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=97)|
| 0:01:40| excited for her and her new role at AMPO, and we'll, several of us will still interact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=100)|
| 0:01:45| with her, and she's not leaving Knoxville, so that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=105)|
| 0:01:48| We are currently hiring a GIS analyst, Jace Swain-Crowley, who you all probably haven't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=108)|
| 0:01:53| met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=113)|
| 0:01:54| He's one of our behind-the-scenes folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=114)|
| 0:01:56| Recently left for a job and to pursue graduate studies in Maryland, so we will be filling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=116)|
| 0:02:01| that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=121)|
| 0:02:02| And David Hobbs has joined our team since the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=122)|
| 0:02:05| He is working on the addressing team along with Madison Lewis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=125)|
| 0:02:10| Staff Promotions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=130)|
| 0:02:11| Lindsay has been promoted to Principal Planner and Design Review Program Manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=131)|
| 0:02:17| This really is in recognition of her years of experience and her exceptional work leading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=137)|
| 0:02:20| the Historic Zoning Commission as well as the Design Review Board, and she will continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=140)|
| 0:02:25| to serve in a leadership role with those boards and then within a more specialized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=145)|
| 0:02:30| segment of the agency's work program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=150)|
| 0:02:32| So it'll include development review, historic preservation, urban design, housing, as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=152)|
| 0:02:36| as community facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=156)|
| 0:02:37| So really excited to have her serve in that role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=157)|
| 0:02:39| Allie Ketron, she occasionally presents to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=159)|
| 0:02:43| She has been promoted to our Strategic Planning and Communications Manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=163)|
| 0:02:46| This is a new position, and it involves work that she's already been undertaking for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=166)|
| 0:02:51| last several years, which is related to public relations and dissemination of information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=171)|
| 0:02:56| managing our web team, as well as our graphics team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=176)|
| 0:03:00| And she'll continue to work with our staff, media, citizen groups, other agencies, businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=180)|
| 0:03:07| to help improve understanding of what we do and why we do it, and how we can better partner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=187)|
| 0:03:12| with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=192)|
| 0:03:13| So this position will work closely with me to identify strategic initiatives to fulfill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=193)|
| 0:03:17| our mission as an agency, as well as serving as the planning agency for the city and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=197)|
| 0:03:22| So excited to have her take that on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=202)|
| 0:03:25| Andrea Kepfer has been promoted to Supervisor of Addressing and Subdivision Teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=205)|
| 0:03:31| You all, again, she's sort of one of the behind-the-scenes folks, so you probably don't interact with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=211)|
| 0:03:35| her very much, but this is a really important role, and we're really excited to have her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=215)|
| 0:03:39| take on that leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=219)|
| 0:03:41| And that's it for staff updates right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=221)|
| 0:03:46| The 2023 Facts and Figures Report is now available on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=226)|
| 0:03:50| This is something that we do annually, and it reports on natural, commercial, cultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=230)|
| 0:03:56| features of the Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=236)|
| 0:03:58| I will send out a link to this after this meeting, so if you all want to take a deeper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=238)|
| 0:04:02| dive into that, I really encourage you to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=242)|
| 0:04:04| It's some really great information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=244)|
| 0:04:06| So PLATS, again, I want to thank those of you who were able to attend our special called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=246)|
| 0:04:12| meeting to address the state law change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=252)|
| 0:04:14| Really appreciate you all taking the time to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=254)|
| 0:04:16| I also just wanted to make you all aware that with that change in state law, the Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=256)|
| 0:04:21| Commission will now begin seeing PLATS with more than 25 lots on the agenda, even if no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=261)|
| 0:04:26| variance to the subdivision regulations are requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=266)|
| 0:04:30| And so just as a reminder, because you all typically haven't been seeing these for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=270)|
| 0:04:35| last five or six years, a final PLAT is the official survey instrument to be placed in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=275)|
| 0:04:40| the public records of the Knox County Register of Deeds following approval and certification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=280)|
| 0:04:44| by this body or planning staff as authorized by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=284)|
| 0:04:49| So a final PLAT is required for all major and minor subdivisions, and a final PLAT cannot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=289)|
| 0:04:54| be submitted until the concept plan has been approved by this body and the design plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=294)|
| 0:04:58| has been approved by staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=298)|
| 0:05:01| That would be planning staff and the appropriate department, so it could be city or county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=301)|
| 0:05:05| per the subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=305)|
| 0:05:08| And really what's within your authority is to either approve or deny the PLAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=308)|
| 0:05:11| And as the Commission fails to approve or disapprove a final PLAT, well, they must,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=311)|
| 0:05:18| you all must approve it once it's on your agenda within 60 days, or deny it after that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=318)|
| 0:05:24| initial consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=324)|
| 0:05:25| So again, you're really just looking at it to make sure that it complies with the concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=325)|
| 0:05:31| plan and design plan that had been previously approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=331)|
| 0:05:33| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=333)|
| 0:05:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=336)|
| 0:05:37| For some unforeseen reason, a PLAT was denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=337)|
| 0:05:41| What happens to the project and the PLAT after that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=341)|
| 0:05:43| I mean, the applicant can't appeal it, but otherwise it's denied, so they can't move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=343)|
| 0:05:51| forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=351)|
| 0:05:52| Yeah, Chancery Court, yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=352)|
| 0:05:56| They can appeal it to Chancery Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=356)|
| 0:06:00| That's a good question for the final PLAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=360)|
| 0:06:14| Yeah, yeah, you, they'd have to go back through the concept plan process of the whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=374)|
| 0:06:21| That's what I was getting at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=381)|
| 0:06:22| Like, you know, are they able to make a modification and come back to review that PLAT, or is it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=382)|
| 0:06:29| denied and it has to go back to a much earlier part of the project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=389)|
| 0:06:33| Yeah, our recommendation would be for them to go back through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=393)|
| 0:06:37| Otherwise, I mean, they can't just keep reintroducing, you know, what they had proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=397)|
| 0:06:42| So yes, they would have to, they'd have to make some changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=402)|
| 0:06:46| Any other questions, concerns, clarifications?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=406)|
| 0:06:55| So we'll get started with the review of agenda items, and I'll turn it over to, oh, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=415)|
| 0:07:05| no, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=425)|
| 0:07:06| I forgot about your mic over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=426)|
| 0:07:08| Yeah, so Mike is going to present the Regional Roadway Safety Action Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=428)|
| 0:07:13| The TPO staff and consultants recently completed this Roadway Safety Action Plan, and it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=433)|
| 0:07:18| updated, it was adopted last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=438)|
| 0:07:21| And again, this is something that Ms. Zaviska had worked on, and I appreciate Mike for taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=441)|
| 0:07:26| the time to present this to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=446)|
| 0:07:29| Thank you, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=449)|
| 0:07:30| Yeah, again, my name is Mike Conger, and I'm on planning staff, but primarily deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=450)|
| 0:07:34| the transportation planning organization side of things, so you guys don't see me too often| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=454)|
| 0:07:39| at your meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=459)|
| 0:07:40| And again, Ellen Zaviska took the lead on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=460)|
| 0:07:43| I was really very indirect role, so I'm going to do my best to go through these slides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=463)|
| 0:07:48| and I apologize in advance if my knowledge is not as good as hers on this overall effort here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=468)|
| 0:07:57| So where this comes from, the Regional Roadway Safety Action Plan, is from the Federal Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=477)|
| 0:08:01| Administration's special funding source called Safe Streets and Roads for All, acronym SS4A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=481)|
| 0:08:09| Federal Highway loves acronyms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=489)|
| 0:08:11| We deal with that a lot in TPO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=491)|
| 0:08:13| But what this is, is $5 billion nationwide over a five-year period for planning and implementation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=493)|
| 0:08:21| to improve roadway safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=501)|
| 0:08:23| We got a jump start on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=503)|
| 0:08:25| We actually used local funds to do the plan, whereas most agencies apply for a planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=505)|
| 0:08:30| grant, you know, spending a couple years, get the certified plan for this to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=510)|
| 0:08:35| to apply for real projects on the ground implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=515)|
| 0:08:40| So we're in a position where we were able to apply for actual projects for the second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=520)|
| 0:08:44| round of funding, whereas most agencies like ours are still in the planning phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=524)|
| 0:08:49| So we felt like that was a big benefit to doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=529)|
| 0:08:54| In the plan, we do make a commitment to reduce fatal and serious injury crashes by two-thirds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=534)|
| 0:08:59| by 2045.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=539)|
| 0:09:01| Federal Highway wants you to set an actual target with this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=541)|
| 0:09:06| Whether or not we can get there will remain to be seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=546)|
| 0:09:08| We have a long way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=548)|
| 0:09:10| If folks have been seeing in the news, it seems like every other day now there's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=550)|
| 0:09:13| a fatal crash on, you know, mostly on interstates or even on, I think, Ebenezer Road recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=553)|
| 0:09:19| So we have a big challenge with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=559)|
| 0:09:23| And so it does result in prioritized list of strategies and projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=563)|
| 0:09:27| And I should also mention City of Knoxville did a plan in conjunction with ours, a Vision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=567)|
| 0:09:33| Zero plan, where they're actually targeting zero fatal crashes by 2040, I believe, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=573)|
| 0:09:41| the timeframe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=581)|
| 0:09:41| So it was a parallel effort done by our consultants with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=581)|
| 0:09:45| Oh, there are some bullet points again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=585)|
| 0:09:48| This is kind of new to me, the PowerPoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=588)|
| 0:09:51| So from Federal Highway Administration, they're kind of promoting the safe system approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=591)|
| 0:09:56| They know that we're not going to reduce all fatalities, just looking at one aspect of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=596)|
| 0:09:59| the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=599)|
| 0:10:00| You know, with the roads, it's also behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=600)|
| 0:10:03| We see a lot of driving under influence, texting and driving, other factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=603)|
| 0:10:08| We got to look at the roadway and the user, and also even post-crash care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=608)|
| 0:10:14| And the real issue we see is that speeds are a major factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=614)|
| 0:10:19| High speed really tremendously increases the chances of a major serious injury or fatal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=619)|
| 0:10:26| crash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=626)|
| 0:10:27| So especially at the neighborhood level and lower streets, we need to try to focus on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=627)|
| 0:10:32| addressing speeds as much as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=632)|
| 0:10:36| So what this is, a data-driven plan to really focus in on where the issues are in the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=636)|
| 0:10:41| with historical crash data, which we have a wealth of that available to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=641)|
| 0:10:47| Thankfully, through the state Tennessee DOT, Tennessee Highway Safety Office, allows us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=647)|
| 0:10:53| access to all the crash data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=653)|
| 0:10:55| And the consultants compiled this into the, you know, looking at each segment of road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=655)|
| 0:10:59| And what we've identified here is that only 1.7% of the regional streets account for close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=659)|
| 0:11:05| to 30% of the injury crashes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=665)|
| 0:11:09| So those give us our target areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=669)|
| 0:11:13| City of Knoxville, we did separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=673)|
| 0:11:15| There is even more dramatic as far as the roadway network coverage of this 5% of their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=675)|
| 0:11:21| street system accounts for 63%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=681)|
| 0:11:24| These are all, you know, they're major arterials typically, state routes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=684)|
| 0:11:28| So TDOT is a major partner in this and they've been engaged throughout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=688)|
| 0:11:31| We're working with them to address these also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=691)|
| 0:11:35| So we also looked at a sort of predictive approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=695)|
| 0:11:38| We don't always want to be reactive with crashes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=698)|
| 0:11:41| We want to see what are the factors causing these crashes and then look at the roadways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=701)|
| 0:11:45| that have those, exhibit those same characteristics and maybe predict where they might occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=705)|
| 0:11:51| So we've identified these crash profiles both in Knoxville and the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=711)|
| 0:11:57| So some common factors again that we could look at, one thing, left turn, U-turn related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=717)|
| 0:12:03| at signalized intersections and pedestrian bicyclists in commercial areas along arterials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=723)|
| 0:12:11| That's in the city and then regional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=731)|
| 0:12:14| I see that these symbols are reversed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=734)|
| 0:12:17| There's a nighttime issue that we see showing up in the data that I guess the moon should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=737)|
| 0:12:23| be up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=743)|
| 0:12:24| Also with the roadway curvature, you get regional, rural characteristics, you know, in our area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=744)|
| 0:12:30| we have a lot of rural roads with no shoulders and sharp curves and those type of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=750)|
| 0:12:36| So trying to address those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=756)|
| 0:12:38| And then finally, we do see a lot of motorcycle, obviously when a motorcycle is involved in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=758)|
| 0:12:42| a crash, it typically is pretty serious and often fatal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=762)|
| 0:12:47| So with this predictive analysis, again, we have all this data at our disposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=767)|
| 0:12:51| Again with GIS, you can plug that all in and see where things are and correlate with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=771)|
| 0:12:56| one another with the roadway attributes and traffic and all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=776)|
| 0:13:01| So we've identified some of the major roadways where these predictive factors would show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=781)|
| 0:13:06| that there's likely to be crashes occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=786)|
| 0:13:09| And then I know this is a very busy map here, but this is all plotted in GIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=789)|
| 0:13:13| So each roadway segment is given kind of a predictive score and a color code to correlate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=793)|
| 0:13:20| that where there's, if it's a low probability but high crashes, those are in blue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=800)|
| 0:13:27| So those are, you know, this is a model we've created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=807)|
| 0:13:30| So obviously the model doesn't include every variable correlated with crashes, but we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=810)|
| 0:13:36| to look at these and see what's going on with the roadways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=816)|
| 0:13:42| Obviously where there's a high probability and a high crash rate, you know, that's showing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=822)|
| 0:13:47| what we would expect to occur there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=827)|
| 0:13:50| So with this, we can be hopefully proactive again and find projects to address issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=830)|
| 0:13:54| before they become a real issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=834)|
| 0:13:58| City of Knoxville, same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=838)|
| 0:14:01| So also in the plan, there's an action plan framework organized around these themes of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=841)|
| 0:14:07| design, land use plans, policy and programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=847)|
| 0:14:11| So it's not just identifying roadway projects, it's identifying other factors and policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=851)|
| 0:14:17| and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=857)|
| 0:14:18| I won't go through all of these, there's like 30 different ones that have been identified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=858)|
| 0:14:23| and there's this legend here that shows you what the timeline might be to implement that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=863)|
| 0:14:28| you know, how easy it is to do, who would take the lead and how much it would cost and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=868)|
| 0:14:33| those type of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=873)|
| 0:14:34| So this is all laid out in the plan and it's posted to our website for folks that want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=874)|
| 0:14:39| to dig into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=879)|
| 0:14:41| I did just put in these short term land use ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=881)|
| 0:14:44| This body is involved with land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=884)|
| 0:14:47| So I threw these in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=887)|
| 0:14:48| There's I think three of them that we've identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=888)|
| 0:14:52| They all are somewhat related to the vulnerable road user, we call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=892)|
| 0:14:57| Those are bicyclists, pedestrians and looking at land use policies to try to reduce their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=897)|
| 0:15:02| exposure to risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=902)|
| 0:15:04| So one thing is, you know, reductions to off street parking requirements to hopefully promote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=904)|
| 0:15:09| better multimodal access, you know, less vehicular traffic in those areas where it makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=909)|
| 0:15:19| Requiring new developments to consider bicycle and pedestrian impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=919)|
| 0:15:21| I think we're already doing a lot of that, you know, we do that when we review concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=921)|
| 0:15:26| plans and look at that aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=926)|
| 0:15:30| Also expanding bicycle parking requirements where it's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=930)|
| 0:15:35| So that's just a few of those I just, you know, barely want to touch on today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| I don't want to go into a whole lot of time or detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=938)|
| 0:15:42| Then the one thing that folks are mostly interested in, you know, what are we going to try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=942)|
| 0:15:45| get on the ground for implementation with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=945)|
| 0:15:48| The deadline for the grant funding application was like July 12th, so last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=948)|
| 0:15:54| It was a big rush to get the plan finalized, adopted and get this project submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=954)|
| 0:16:00| So at the regional level, we did apply for $7.2 million in federal funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=960)|
| 0:16:06| I think the cap was around $10 million that you're allowed to apply for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=966)|
| 0:16:10| We did identify in conjunction with Knox County, I wish Jim was here, he could tell you more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=970)|
| 0:16:15| about these projects, but the county was especially involved in here and wanted to get some projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=975)|
| 0:16:20| on county roads, even though most of our stuff, again, showed up as state road in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=980)|
| 0:16:27| what's happening, you know, historical, but through the predictive analysis, we were able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=987)|
| 0:16:32| to show that where's the need for these in the county, county-owned roadways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=992)|
| 0:16:37| So there's seven projects in Knox County, one in Oak Ridge, one in Maryville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=997)|
| 0:16:42| We also applied for a regional safety messaging grant where we tried to get public information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1002)|
| 0:16:46| out again on the behavioral side of things and Anderson County, a separate study for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1006)|
| 0:16:50| them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1010)|
| 0:16:52| City of Knoxville did apply for a separate aspect for two projects on city streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1012)|
| 0:16:58| I think theirs was around $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1018)|
| 0:17:00| One's on North Broadway, Woodland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1020)|
| 0:17:03| These are actually projects already under development with some greenway connections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1023)|
| 0:17:08| and I think a road diet for Woodland Avenue through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1028)|
| 0:17:12| So these are already underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1032)|
| 0:17:13| They're hoping that the fact that the projects have already some activities underway that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1033)|
| 0:17:18| the federal government will look more favorably on ones that are, you know, more shovel-ready,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1038)|
| 0:17:23| not exactly shovel-ready, but they have been through some of the process, so a little further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1043)|
| 0:17:29| along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1049)|
| 0:17:31| And then finally, some issues that arose that seen at Magnolia Avenue, we've seen several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1051)|
| 0:17:37| major crashes on that corridor recently, and so they're targeting, I think at Cherry Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1057)|
| 0:17:43| and I forget the name of the known, it's hard to see on here, but okay, Cherry Street and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1063)|
| 0:17:48| Hembury Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1068)|
| 0:17:50| So I don't have a lot of the details on these projects, but we can follow up if you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1070)|
| 0:17:54| questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1074)|
| 0:17:55| And I think that's all I had, so that's a real quick overview, and again, check it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1075)|
| 0:18:01| online and reach out to us if you have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1081)|
| 0:18:05| So you take that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1085)|
| 0:18:08| Thanks a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1088)|
| 0:18:10| Thank you, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1090)|
| 0:18:14| That's also another link that I'll add to that email that I'll send out this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1094)|
| 0:18:20| So as Lindsey's getting set up, I'll just provide a couple introductory remarks here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1100)|
| 0:18:28| So this is the first time you're going to, Lindsey's going to go over several requests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1108)|
| 0:18:33| for ordinance amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1113)|
| 0:18:35| This is the first time in recent memory that, or maybe ever, that we've received a request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1115)|
| 0:18:40| for this many amendments to the code, and I would call them fairly significant, or they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1120)|
| 0:18:46| would be fairly significant requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1126)|
| 0:18:49| So Ms. Lindsey, with assistance from Michelle and Deputy Director Brian Berry, have done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1129)|
| 0:18:56| a great job, in my opinion, of, in a fairly short amount of time, of analyzing the proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1136)|
| 0:19:01| amendments for your consideration today and on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1141)|
| 0:19:06| I think it's also important to mention that, as you may recall, planning led a missing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1146)|
| 0:19:11| middle housing analysis last summer on behalf of the City of Knoxville with support from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1151)|
| 0:19:16| the Knoxville Area Realtors Association, or East Tennessee Realtors Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1156)|
| 0:19:20| That's correct, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1160)|
| 0:19:21| Yeah, they just rebranded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1161)|
| 0:19:24| So as indicated in the letter found in your packet from Deputy, Deputy to the Mayor Aaron| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1164)|
| 0:19:31| Gill, addressing opportunities for reducing barriers to increasing the housing supply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1171)|
| 0:19:36| increasing diversity of housing in the city is a high priority, and since the spring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1176)|
| 0:19:40| the city and planning staff have been working closely together to utilize the missing middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1180)|
| 0:19:47| housing scan to help inform the development of recommendations to be considered later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1187)|
| 0:19:52| this fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1192)|
| 0:19:53| So now I'll turn it over to Lindsey to walk you through the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1193)|
| 0:19:58| Having some screen difficulties on that one, so we may need to refer to the TV screen over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1198)|
| 0:20:03| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1203)|
| 0:20:04| So as Amy introduced, this is a really unique situation of citizen-proposed amendments to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1204)|
| 0:20:10| the City of Knoxville Zoning Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1210)|
| 0:20:13| These amendments focus on residential districts, accessory dwelling units, the CN, commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1213)|
| 0:20:19| neighborhood district, parking and landscaping requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1219)|
| 0:20:23| So there are five amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1223)|
| 0:20:24| They're divided by article of the Zoning Code and they'll require five votes from you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1224)|
| 0:20:29| the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1229)|
| 0:20:30| I have a note here on the screen that has an explainer of the case file organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1230)|
| 0:20:36| as there is a lot of complex information that's provided with all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1236)|
| 0:20:39| So just to give you guys some context, there is an overall memo that has the staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1239)|
| 0:20:45| that applies to each case, along with background information on the recommended process to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1245)|
| 0:20:50| address missing middle housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1250)|
| 0:20:52| There are memos provided by the City of Knoxville, and then there's an individual case file for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1252)|
| 0:20:56| each amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| So that includes the proposed amendment text from the applicant, planning staff analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1258)|
| 0:21:03| and then analysis provided by the City Plans Review and Inspection staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1263)|
| 0:21:07| So I'm going to begin by giving y'all some context for the staff recommendation, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1267)|
| 0:21:11| then I'll run through the individual amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1271)|
| 0:21:14| The staff recommendation is that planning staff recommends Zoning Code amendments to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1274)|
| 0:21:19| enable middle housing in the city, follow the implementation process that was defined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1279)|
| 0:21:24| by our consultant, Optikos, in the September missing middle housing scan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1284)|
| 0:21:28| So you'll probably hear me referring to it as the scan, the middle housing scan, throughout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1288)|
| 0:21:33| this presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1293)|
| 0:21:36| We are recommending a comprehensive process, so it'll go beyond selected tweaks to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1296)|
| 0:21:41| existing zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| It'll also include a review of the relevant adopted plans to ensure that the code updates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1303)|
| 0:21:49| align with the adopted plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1309)|
| 0:21:52| And then it will also include an intensive review of the code to avoid unintended discrepancies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1312)|
| 0:21:58| or errors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1318)|
| 0:21:59| So when you change one thing, you have to make sure you update it in other locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1319)|
| 0:22:04| I'm going to break this down briefly on the slides to follow, and there is more detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1324)|
| 0:22:08| in Exhibit A in the staff memo, but based on the recommendations of the missing middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1328)|
| 0:22:14| scan, the process will focus on a target area that's naturally supportive to middle housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1334)|
| 0:22:19| forms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1339)|
| 0:22:20| It will include dimensional and design standards that ensure how scale buildings that are compatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1340)|
| 0:22:26| with the existing neighborhood context, and then we want to encourage retention of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1346)|
| 0:22:30| existing houses via conversions or additions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1350)|
| 0:22:33| The process will also incorporate public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1353)|
| 0:22:36| That's a big part of this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| So just a very brief refresher on the missing middle definition, and I would refer you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1358)|
| 0:22:43| to the scan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1363)|
| 0:22:44| It's available on our website under plans and studies, but the definition here is missing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1364)|
| 0:22:49| middle is how scale buildings with multiple units in walkable neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1369)|
| 0:22:55| So to really thoughtfully incorporate that in our city, we need to make zoning code updates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1375)|
| 0:23:02| to address each component of that, how scale multiple units on those existing lots and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1382)|
| 0:23:07| then walkable neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1387)|
| 0:23:10| So part of the process, along with planning's information services staff and the GIS analysts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1390)|
| 0:23:17| we have already identified walkable environments that are described as either ideal or appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1397)|
| 0:23:23| for missing middle housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1403)|
| 0:23:26| One can accommodate them immediately, and one could accommodate them with infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1406)|
| 0:23:30| improvements, and so that's the map on the left that's showing the centers and corridors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1410)|
| 0:23:35| the walkable environments in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1415)|
| 0:23:38| These are both in the scan, these graphics, so I would definitely encourage you all refer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1418)|
| 0:23:41| to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| These neighborhoods have the characteristics that are shown on the screen on the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1423)|
| 0:23:47| So they have proximity to amenities and mixed use areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1427)|
| 0:23:51| The neighborhoods have bike and pedestrian routes, transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| You can see smaller block sizes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1434)|
| 0:23:57| Lindsay, where can this specific map be found today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1437)|
| 0:24:01| So it is in these graphics or in the missing middle housing scan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1441)|
| 0:24:07| But in terms of the presentation where you've sort of pulled out these selects, this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1447)|
| 0:24:12| not available to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1452)|
| 0:24:14| It is not in the case file, but I can send you direct page references after the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1454)|
| 0:24:20| Yeah, definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1460)|
| 0:24:25| So generally, these are more walkable urban cores and traditional neighborhood areas as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1465)|
| 0:24:31| opposed to neighborhoods that are developed solely towards automobile use, and that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1471)|
| 0:24:36| be the one on the far right, more cul-de-sacs, stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1476)|
| 0:24:41| So the process, this is identified in the initial memo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1481)|
| 0:24:45| I'm not going to go all the way through this, but the main thing is that the first two steps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1485)|
| 0:24:49| in this process have already been completed via the missing middle housing scan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1489)|
| 0:24:53| We've identified these neighborhoods, and we've identified the barriers to missing middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1493)|
| 0:24:57| housing in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1497)|
| 0:24:58| Opti-Coast completed a really thorough analysis of our current zoning code of RN 2, 3, 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1498)|
| 0:25:04| and 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1504)|
| 0:25:06| So now we're at the phase of implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1506)|
| 0:25:09| So for implementation, again, we work with that target area, apply findings of the scan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1509)|
| 0:25:14| to target areas, use a form-based code approach to fit desired building types to actual lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1514)|
| 0:25:20| sizes, and then incorporate design standards to ensure compatibility with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1520)|
| 0:25:25| That recommendation, 25 on the slide, talks about the clear standards that are necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1525)|
| 0:25:31| to incorporate missing middle in existing neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1531)|
| 0:25:36| So again, instead of selective increases or decreases to the existing standards, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1536)|
| 0:25:41| may create unintended consequences if they're applied citywide or contradict other sections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1541)|
| 0:25:47| of the code or adopted plans, we would recommend following this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1547)|
| 0:25:53| And this process that staff has laid out here is different from the amendments in front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1553)|
| 0:25:57| of you today, which I'm going to go through now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1557)|
| 0:25:59| These would apply to zoning districts throughout the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1559)|
| 0:26:02| So I'm going to just provide a very brief summary of the amendments, and then I'm going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1562)|
| 0:26:06| to hit the high points of the analysis by planning and plans review and inspection staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1566)|
| 0:26:10| I'm not going to be able to hit all of the analysis points, so I would just refer you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1570)|
| 0:26:15| to each case file for the additional commentary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1575)|
| 0:26:18| So 8A focuses on the residential code, and some of the major points include adding a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1578)|
| 0:26:25| definition of detached multifamily dwellings, which is a collection of detached single-family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1585)|
| 0:26:32| or two-family structures on one lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1592)|
| 0:26:35| That's the definition provided in the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1595)|
| 0:26:38| It's added as a permitted use to the RN 3, 4, 5, and 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1598)|
| 0:26:45| The other major one here is changing a duplex from a special use to a permitted use in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1605)|
| 0:26:51| RN 1 and RN 2 zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1611)|
| 0:26:55| And then finally, the applicant proposes changing the minimum front setback in the RN 2 from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1615)|
| 0:27:02| 20 feet to 10 feet, or the average of the block, with a minimum of 5 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1622)|
| 0:27:08| So that's 5 to 10 feet in the RN 2 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1628)|
| 0:27:14| Some of the points identified by staff in this analysis, the detached multifamily dwelling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1634)|
| 0:27:19| that would require additional dimensional standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| That doesn't include a number of unit count instead of that basic definition provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1641)|
| 0:27:27| in the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1647)|
| 0:27:28| Also, our city code already allows for multiple dwellings on one lot in the RN 3 through 7| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1648)|
| 0:27:33| and via pocket neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1653)|
| 0:27:34| So we do have a route through to accommodate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1654)|
| 0:27:38| And yes, most of the modifications to the purpose statements would require amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1658)|
| 0:27:44| to the one-year plan, the land use classification table, and the use matrix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1664)|
| 0:27:49| And then this is kind of throughout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1669)|
| 0:27:51| The application references recommendations in the missing middle housing scan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1671)|
| 0:27:55| However, they don't always correspond with the proposed amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1675)|
| 0:27:59| So for example here, front setbacks are not actually identified as a barrier to missing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1679)|
| 0:28:03| middle housing in the RN 2, 3, or 4 districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1683)|
| 0:28:08| And then reducing front setbacks in the RN 2 to 10 feet or 5 feet minimum would be inconsistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1688)|
| 0:28:15| with most block faces in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1695)|
| 0:28:17| And again, these would be applied citywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1697)|
| 0:28:20| 8B focuses on the CN zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1700)|
| 0:28:24| So the CN zone was not evaluated by the missing middle housing scan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1704)|
| 0:28:29| Some of the proposals include eliminating the minimum corner setback in the CN zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1709)|
| 0:28:35| reducing a minimum rear setback, and then establishing new standards when the CN zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1715)|
| 0:28:40| features residential uses only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1720)|
| 0:28:44| The last one, that's challenging because additional language would be required to clarify residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1724)|
| 0:28:49| uses only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1729)|
| 0:28:50| Obviously, buildings uses can and do change over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| So something may be built differently from a way that is used 10 years in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1733)|
| 0:29:01| Scale is a common point in the analysis you'll read multiple times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1741)|
| 0:29:06| Going back to that definition of missing middle housing as house scale and compatible with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1746)|
| 0:29:10| the context, here reducing the setbacks would, in a blanket fashion, brings up questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1750)|
| 0:29:17| of scale and compatibility with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1757)|
| 0:29:20| Finally, there are concerns about utility and drainage easements in the subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1760)|
| 0:29:24| regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| 8C pertains to the accessory dwelling unit code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1766)|
| 0:29:30| So the applicant proposes eliminating the owner-occupied requirement for accessory dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1770)|
| 0:29:36| units, removing the minimum lot size requirement, decreasing minimum rear setbacks, and increasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1776)|
| 0:29:42| the potential sizes of ADU by removing the maximum gross floor area requirement, increasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1782)|
| 0:29:48| the height to 30 feet tall or the height of the primary structure, whichever is greater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1788)|
| 0:29:54| and then increasing the ratio of the ADU to the primary dwelling from 40% to 50% max.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1794)|
| 0:30:00| So again, the analysis does come back to scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1800)|
| 0:30:04| Increasing the height, the ratio, and the gross floor area would result in structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1804)|
| 0:30:07| that are larger and taller than the original intent of the ADU, which would be accessory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1807)|
| 0:30:12| to the primary dwelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| There are also stormwater management concerns and conflicts with the utility and drainage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1814)|
| 0:30:18| easements from the subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1818)|
| 0:30:21| 8D addresses the parking code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1821)|
| 0:30:25| So there are items on interior side setbacks for parking lots, but the primary element| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1825)|
| 0:30:29| here is removing parking requirements for almost all residential uses, single family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1829)|
| 0:30:36| two family, townhouse, multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| So in the analysis side of that, eliminating parking requirements for almost all residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1838)|
| 0:30:45| uses in every zoning district in the city would create unintended consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1845)|
| 0:30:50| The middle housing scan focuses on parking reductions and working with the parking code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1850)|
| 0:30:57| in the middle housing areas that are within short walking distances of amenities, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1857)|
| 0:31:02| not every neighborhood in the city has access to sidewalks, transit, amenities, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1862)|
| 0:31:08| There's also an amendment providing an exemption where adequate street parking exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1868)|
| 0:31:13| However, adequate street parking, that's a subjective term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1873)|
| 0:31:17| It's a concept that would require additional definition and a comprehensive parking analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| to quantify and define what adequate means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| Finally, 8E touches on the landscaping code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1884)|
| 0:31:28| The missing middle housing scan didn't identify landscaping plans or buffers as a barrier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1888)|
| 0:31:33| to the creation of middle housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1893)|
| 0:31:36| One main item here is requiring a landscaping plan approval prior to the certificate of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1896)|
| 0:31:41| occupancy, instead of prior to the issuance of a building permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1901)|
| 0:31:46| And plans review and inspection staff identified this as an issue because typically landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1906)|
| 0:31:50| is a lower priority in development, and sites may not have enough space to implement landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1910)|
| 0:31:58| If it's planned just before construction is complete, then they would have to seek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1918)|
| 0:32:03| alternative landscape design applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1923)|
| 0:32:06| So in general, the staff recommendation is to follow the process identified by the consultant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1926)|
| 0:32:13| And then I, that's a lot of information, so I would just recommend that you guys refer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1933)|
| 0:32:18| back to the analysis in each of the files and then the missing middle housing scan on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1938)|
| 0:32:23| our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1943)|
| 0:32:25| And I'm happy to answer any questions or make any clarifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1945)|
| 0:32:28| Go back to any of the slides if you all have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1948)|
| 0:32:35| Just to clarify, did the applicant write these amendments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1955)|
| 0:32:40| The applicant wrote the, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1960)|
| 0:32:42| Well, the applicant made alterations to the existing zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1962)|
| 0:32:48| And those are the text that's provided in your case file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1968)|
| 0:32:53| These are the summaries right here were written by staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| And so the amendment text that the applicant proposed, it's in Times New Roman font.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1978)|
| 0:33:03| It's got some additional colors in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| It's the first one in your case file, and it says proposed amendment text in the top| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1985)|
| 0:33:09| left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1989)|
| 0:33:10| Lindsay, I don't know if it's far enough along in the process for what the city is already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=1990)|
| 0:33:21| working on, but is there anything that speaks directly to parking requirements in the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2001)|
| 0:33:30| that the city is either currently undertaking or planning to undertake?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2010)|
| 0:33:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2014)|
| 0:33:35| The city and planning staff, plans review and engineering are evaluating the parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2015)|
| 0:33:41| requirements associated with these missing middle housing forms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2021)|
| 0:33:46| There will be a parking element of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2026)|
| 0:33:49| It hasn't been developed fully yet, but yes, there will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2029)|
| 0:33:53| I've got a few questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2033)|
| 0:33:56| So when it comes to setbacks, side setbacks or front setbacks, I can understand on some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2036)|
| 0:34:04| small lots where reducing those makes sense, but then also if this is blanket across the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2044)|
| 0:34:09| entire city, you've got large lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| You don't need to have just five feet setbacks on a hundred foot wide lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2052)|
| 0:34:17| So like how does the missing middle housing scan recommend handling setbacks with various| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2057)|
| 0:34:23| types of missing middle housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2063)|
| 0:34:27| So the middle housing scan recommends regulating dimensional standards by the building type,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2067)|
| 0:34:35| similar to a form-based code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| So in the report, it goes through the different forms of middle housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2077)|
| 0:34:43| There's a stacked duplex where there's one on top of the other, side by side, triplex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2083)|
| 0:34:48| quadplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2088)|
| 0:34:49| And the aim is to regulate those dimensional standards, side setbacks, front setbacks by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2089)|
| 0:34:54| the building form to ensure that that form fits within the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2094)|
| 0:34:58| And in some instances there can be a range so that the person building the property can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2098)|
| 0:35:03| kind of work within that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2103)|
| 0:35:05| And they also correspond to lot width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2105)|
| 0:35:13| So recently city council passed a resolution to have planning staff look at allowing duplexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2113)|
| 0:35:20| by right within RN2, along with lot coverage requirements with it, is that right, Ms. Brooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2120)|
| 0:35:28| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2128)|
| 0:35:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2129)|
| 0:35:30| So that would be something that would be coming down to us in the next few months or so?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2130)|
| 0:35:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2134)|
| 0:35:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2135)|
| 0:35:36| That applies citywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2136)|
| 0:35:39| Have there been any CN residential projects in the city that we know of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2139)|
| 0:35:49| I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2149)|
| 0:35:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2152)|
| 0:35:53| But off the top of my head, we could get back to you, unless one of the staff remembered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2153)|
| 0:35:57| the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2157)|
| 0:35:58| There have been some CN rezonings where the anticipated development is residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2158)|
| 0:36:06| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2166)|
| 0:36:07| So CN, and CN doesn't have a strict, I guess when I've looked at CN, it doesn't seem to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2167)|

| 0:36:29| I guess I would, I guess we can talk about this more on Thursday, but I guess I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2189)|
| 0:36:33| worry about a lot of people trying to like gravitate towards a sort of vague description| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2193)|

| 0:36:43| But, and then one other question when it comes to, you know, I noticed a lot of these reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2203)|
| 0:36:50| cite subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2210)|
| 0:36:53| I guess I'm not quite clear on all of the lots that have been planted already in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2213)|
| 0:36:59| city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2219)|
| 0:37:00| I know in Platt's, it's very clear that there are, you know, five foot easements between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2220)|
| 0:37:05| lots and 10 abutting public roads or alleys, but like old lots in the city where I feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2225)|
| 0:37:11| like a lot of this missing middle is intended to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2231)|
| 0:37:16| Were those understood to be dedicated at the time in terms of easements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2236)|
| 0:37:22| I can kind of speak to that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| I'd say no, it'd be a case by case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2244)|
| 0:37:26| So, depending on when the UND easements came into being and the property that was planted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2246)|
| 0:37:31| after that, then yes, they would have those dedications, but they also have the option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2251)|
| 0:37:35| to release those easements through a new plat, but yes, so they would be looking at a case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2255)|
| 0:37:40| by case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2260)|
| 0:37:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2262)|
| 0:37:43| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2263)|
| 0:37:44| Can I, real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2264)|
| 0:37:57| We seem to have looked at, over the last couple years, allowing certain things to be applied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2277)|

| 0:38:06| We've broadened the ability to ask for things, to be a little more flexible with people doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2286)|
| 0:38:18| new things and new ideas and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2298)|
| 0:38:24| Is there a thought from staff that some of these ideas that seem fairly new, that might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2304)|
| 0:38:30| not fit in a nice, neat box today, might be able to be added to a chart that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2310)|

| 0:38:42| a case by case basis, or are we not going to do anything with this other than what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2322)|

| 0:38:54| I'm just curious how you get from the scan to practical application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2334)|
| 0:39:01| I think, as Lindsay mentioned, the application of the recommendations from the missing middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2341)|

| 0:39:11| that it makes more sense for these, and to reduce additional barriers for people to develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2351)|
| 0:39:17| this type of housing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| We have discussed if there are some types of missing middle housing forms that should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2359)|
| 0:39:27| be, still remain at special use, but that's still under discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2367)|
| 0:39:34| I have a question about what Commissioner Schelso brought up, which is the city councils| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2374)|
| 0:39:43| sending the request for RN2 to be reviewed for duplex by right, and the amendments that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2383)|
| 0:39:55| we are looking at right now, which seem to include some of that same element, and seems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2395)|
| 0:40:06| like it's coming from both sides, but that there is also a recommendation from staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2406)|
| 0:40:14| to really look at pursuing this through the process that already exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2414)|
| 0:40:20| We're getting that communication through the assessment here, but we're not getting that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2420)|
| 0:40:26| from the city council coming our direction, so I guess my question is, what city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2426)|
| 0:40:34| is sending back to us, that's going to go through staff as well before it comes to Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2434)|
| 0:40:40| Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2440)|
| 0:40:41| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2441)|
| 0:40:42| Thank you, Lindsay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2442)|
| 0:40:43| Now we'll turn it over to Jesse to talk about Level 2 review, hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2443)|
| 0:41:07| I believe this is the first one since the code went into effect in January of 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2467)|
| 0:41:20| Okay, so this is item number 6 on the agenda, case 8A23HPA, and this is the first Level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2480)|

| 0:41:34| Currently the hillside protection COAs are handled at the administrative level by planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2494)|
| 0:41:37| staff who verify that a grading plan for a proposed development is staying within the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2497)|
| 0:41:43| disturbance budget provided by a slope analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2503)|
| 0:41:47| This COA comes before you because the applicant is requesting to exceed that disturbance limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2507)|
| 0:41:52| This parcel is 31.4 acres, and it's located on the northeast side of Central Avenue Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2512)|
| 0:41:58| south of its intersection with Callahan Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2518)|
| 0:42:02| Approximately 24.8 acres of the parcel is within the hillside protection overlay, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2522)|
| 0:42:07| that includes slopes that are greater than 40%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2527)|
| 0:42:10| The applicant is requesting to exceed the allowed disturbance area of 14.17 acres by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2530)|
| 0:42:17| an additional 11 acres for an attached townhouse development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2537)|
| 0:42:22| The requested disturbance equates to the entirety of the HP overlay area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2542)|
| 0:42:26| The basis for this request is that the disturbance permitted by the slope analysis is almost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2546)|
| 0:42:31| entirely taken up by a previously disturbed 14-acre TVA easement that runs across the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2551)|
| 0:42:38| rear and southern side of the parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2558)|
| 0:42:40| The easement is not a buildable area for townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2560)|
| 0:42:50| So this property is zoned RN3, it's the General Residential Neighborhood District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2570)|
| 0:43:01| In addition to the HP overlay zoning, there's also a small area of floodplain overlay zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2581)|
| 0:43:06| where Knob Fort Creek crosses the northernmost corner of the parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2586)|
| 0:43:11| The parcel to the south used to be zoned agricultural, but was recently rezoned RN6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2591)|
| 0:43:18| This map will be updated soon to reflect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| So how this HP overlay is treated in this case could have an impact on future hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2600)|
| 0:43:25| developments such as this large parcel to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2605)|
| 0:43:31| The land use classification for this property is the NC1 Mixed Use Special District in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2611)|
| 0:43:35| North City Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| This classification specifically calls out how important it is that development foster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2617)|
| 0:43:42| conservation of steep slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2622)|
| 0:43:46| Here is the HP overlay where you can see that most of the slopes are below a 25% grade with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2626)|
| 0:43:52| the yellow and green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2632)|
| 0:43:54| But there is a significant amount that exceeds 25% and some that exceeds 40%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2634)|
| 0:44:01| Approximately six acres in total exceed 25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2641)|
| 0:44:06| As you can see in this aerial view, much of the hillside protection area has already been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2646)|
| 0:44:10| cleared for that TVA easement and thus is unbuildable for townhouses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2650)|
| 0:44:17| This 14-acre easement essentially consumes the allowable disturbance for the parcel and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2657)|
| 0:44:23| most of the remaining HP overlay has not ever been previously disturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2663)|
| 0:44:28| In particular, the center portion which has slopes exceeding 25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2668)|
| 0:44:38| The applicant is proposing to essentially disturb the remainder of the parcel outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2678)|
| 0:44:42| of the TVA easement in order to develop 103 townhouses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2682)|
| 0:44:46| This would mean disturbing the entirety of the remaining HP area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2686)|
| 0:44:51| The applicant's request to clear and grade the remainder of the undisturbed HP overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2691)|
| 0:44:54| is based on an exception provided in the HP overlay standards in Article 8.9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2694)|
| 0:44:59| The standards provide four exceptions for the disturbance regulations and the fourth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2699)|
| 0:45:03| one reads as follows, lots that have been previously legally disturbed or developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2703)|
| 0:45:08| are accepted provided that any new or additional disturbance does not exceed the previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2708)|
| 0:45:13| disturbed area or the maximum land disturbance permitted by Table 8.6, which is essentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2713)|
| 0:45:19| our slope analysis, whichever is greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2719)|
| 0:45:23| It is the applicant's argument that the plain language of this provision permits the 11| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2723)|
| 0:45:26| additional acres they wish to disturb because it does not exceed the numeric value of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2726)|
| 0:45:32| previously disturbed area, which is 14 acres, or the disturbance budget, which is 14 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2732)|
| 0:45:39| The applicant approaches these as separate, unrelated considerations, so this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2739)|
| 0:45:44| should be entirely exempt from the HP overlay restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2744)|
| 0:45:52| So staff are recommending approving COA, but only for 5.23 acres, not the 11 acres requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2752)|
| 0:46:05| This disturbance calculation is based on an alternative slope analysis that was conducted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2765)|
| 0:46:10| for just the buildable area of the lot outside of the TVA easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2770)|
| 0:46:14| So we understand that there's practical development considerations there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2774)|
| 0:46:18| The applicant's argument regarding the previous disturbance exemption, if that was taken to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2778)|
| 0:46:23| its logical conclusion, no hillside protection area would actually be protected so long as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2783)|
| 0:46:28| development was conducted in phases of disturbance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2788)|
| 0:46:32| So if you were allowed to disturb 10 acres, you did, and you came back and said I'd like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2792)|
| 0:46:37| to disturb another 10 acres that doesn't exceed what was previously disturbed or the disturbance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2797)|
| 0:46:42| budget, you could do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2802)|
| 0:46:44| So as long as you phased your development, you could clear the entirety of any hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2804)|
| 0:46:48| protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| So as I said before, this is the first Level 2 COA to come before the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2810)|
| 0:46:57| If approval is granted to clear the entirety of this hillside protection overlay based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2817)|
| 0:47:01| on the applicant's argument, I fear it could have grave consequences regarding the enforceability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2821)|
| 0:47:06| of the hillside protection overlay in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2826)|
| 0:47:09| The stated purpose of the Adopted Hillside and Ridgetop Protection Plan is to protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2829)|
| 0:47:14| the forested ridges and hillsides that are a defining feature of our natural heritage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2834)|

| 0:47:26| This alternative slope analysis we are proposing is consistent with Article 16.8, which describes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2846)|
| 0:47:32| that the Planning Commission can review deviations from the hillside protection regulations and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2852)|
| 0:47:38| approve, approve with conditions, or deny the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2858)|
| 0:47:42| So our recommendation with this alternative slope analysis takes into account practical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2862)|
| 0:47:49| considerations for development while still maintaining the enforceability of the hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2869)|
| 0:47:53| protection overlay as intended by the Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2873)|
| 0:47:57| I'm happy to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2877)|
| 0:48:03| Jessie, you said that the plot south of there, or next to it, is RN6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2883)|
| 0:48:12| Is that in your diagram, it looks like it's still AG, or is it the one on the other side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2892)|
| 0:48:20| No, it just hasn't been updated yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2900)|
| 0:48:22| It's a very recent rezoning that came before you all, and it was approved for RN6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2902)|
| 0:48:30| And so usually what happens in these cases, if it came before someone brought this application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2910)|
| 0:48:34| to you, to planning staff, it would be up to planning staff and codes to agree on, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2914)|
| 0:48:40| know, or to come down with a decision, and because, do I understand, because he didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2920)|
| 0:48:44| accept that decision, or the applicant didn't accept the decision, it's now before Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2924)|
| 0:48:48| Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2928)|
| 0:48:49| So typically we have, we conduct a slope analysis which provides that disturbance limitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2929)|
| 0:48:55| You can disturb so many acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2935)|
| 0:48:59| And then we apply the grading plan for a proposed development to that, to ensure that it's staying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2939)|
| 0:49:05| within that disturbance budget, and it's really just making sure that it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2945)|
| 0:49:09| So it's a pretty standard, you know, numeric procedure to provide that certificate of appropriateness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2949)|
| 0:49:18| The reason this Level 2 COA is coming before you is because they are asking to exceed that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2958)|
| 0:49:25| and essentially disturb the entirety of the overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2965)|
| 0:49:29| So it's Article 16 allows you to consider deviations from the hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2969)|
| 0:49:43| Is there any way to amend the language on that disturbance limitation so that developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2983)|
| 0:49:50| aren't phasing it out in a way where they are taking advantage of that hillside protection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2990)|
| 0:49:59| There could be a proposed ordinance amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=2999)|
| 0:50:04| So I don't know if anybody else, and I haven't had an opportunity to read it, but I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3004)|
| 0:50:08| there's been a document uploaded as well, and I think a lot of it is really, maybe comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3008)|
| 0:50:14| down to more of a legal description or interpretation of how it's been worded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3014)|
| 0:50:21| So I don't know if you've had a chance to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3021)|
| 0:50:23| I just got that this morning, right before I was walking into gender review, so I will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3023)|
| 0:50:29| study that and hopefully be able to consult you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3029)|
| 0:50:31| Yeah, I think that'd be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3031)|
| 0:50:33| Yeah, because I don't think it's necessarily something where people are trying to circumvent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3033)|
| 0:50:37| anything, but it's trying to understand, you know, what it does allow and doesn't allow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3037)|
| 0:50:43| So, and I'll take a look at it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3043)|
| 0:50:45| I haven't had an opportunity to read it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3045)|
| 0:50:49| And I'll just add that in our packet, we do have a letter from plans review and inspections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3049)|
| 0:50:55| verifying that our interpretation is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3055)|
| 0:50:59| When it comes to a level two for the planning commission, are there criteria that the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3059)|
| 0:51:07| cites as why we would go beyond the limit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3067)|
| 0:51:14| Yeah, well, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3074)|
| 0:51:30| So, in the process for the overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3090)|
| 0:51:37| Yeah, so, you know, in staff's judgment, if the application meets the requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3097)|
| 0:51:48| of article 8.9, that's the level one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3108)|
| 0:51:53| If there are matters where it may be deviating from article 8.9, this is up to planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3113)|
| 0:52:02| They evaluate based on the evidence presented at the hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3122)|
| 0:52:08| And the approval standards are a little bit below here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3128)|
| 0:52:13| So, these are the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3133)|
| 0:52:22| So, yeah, pursuant to the guidelines in the adopted plan, this code and other adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3142)|
| 0:52:30| plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3150)|
| 0:52:31| So, I did share with you how the sector plan recommends conserving slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3151)|
| 0:52:36| The hillside and ridgetop protection plan does account for flexibility in, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3156)|
| 0:52:43| considering development needs, but also balancing the intent of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3163)|
| 0:52:48| And the code provides for that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3168)|
| 0:52:51| You consider whether it's in harmony with the general purpose intent of the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3171)|
| 0:52:55| And you really look at it on a case by case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3175)|
| 0:52:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3177)|
| 0:52:58| So, it's kind of subjective and up to us, it seems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3178)|
| 0:53:00| Can you pull up that site plan real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3180)|
| 0:53:03| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| This is just a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3185)|
| 0:53:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3190)|
| 0:53:12| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3192)|
| 0:53:14| So, you can see the TBA easement line is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3194)|
| 0:53:21| They're requesting to disturb, you know, what's remaining, essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3201)|
| 0:53:30| So, the property goes all the way back to the railroad, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3210)|
| 0:53:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3215)|
| 0:53:36| Yeah, 14 acres is taken up by that TBA easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3216)|
| 0:53:41| So, the TBA easement is 14 acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3221)|
| 0:53:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3224)|
| 0:53:45| And how much is the front area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3225)|
| 0:53:47| The remaining portion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3227)|
| 0:53:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3230)|
| 0:53:51| So, like 16.5 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3231)|
| 0:53:55| You can see in the packet there's, you know, the original slope analysis for the entire parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3235)|
| 0:54:01| and then there's this revised one for just what's buildable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3241)|
| 0:54:08| If this were done in reverse, would TBA be subjected to the hillside protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3248)|
| 0:54:18| or are they exempt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3258)|
| 0:54:22| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3262)|
| 0:54:25| I don't know how our local regulations interface with TBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3265)|
| 0:54:28| We would need to verify, but I would assume they would be exempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3268)|
| 0:54:31| I would think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3271)|
| 0:54:38| So, from a density perspective, I see we're RN3 there, but the neighboring parcel is RN6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3278)|
| 0:54:45| Is that what I heard earlier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| Yes, and that was approved, if you read in that rezoning recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3287)|
| 0:54:52| based on the fact that the hillside protection overlay is in place to protect disturbance limitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3292)|
| 0:54:58| So, if this were zoned RN6, would that change the density of it or is the way it would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3298)|
| 0:55:06| or you're saying it would still fall under area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3306)|
| 0:55:09| If this was zoned RN6, it wouldn't change the disturbance budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3309)|
| 0:55:14| So, the amount of area that could be disturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3314)|
| 0:55:17| Actually disturbed, yeah, but you could probably do more density right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3317)|
| 0:55:20| but not disturb anymore is what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3320)|
| 0:55:23| As long as it met the dimensional standards, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3323)|
| 0:55:33| And I'll add that there is a, in RN3, this would be a special use as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3333)|
| 0:55:39| So, they're about to do that review, which is on hold until this COA is evaluated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3339)|
| 0:55:53| Thank you. We'll move on to the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| This is a revision from an application that you all reviewed last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3355)|
| 0:55:59| Yeah, I'll be brief on this one since we did review it last month, but the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3359)|
| 0:56:05| so this is the one in Oakwood-Lincoln Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3365)|
| 0:56:07| It's a .67 acre property on Chickamauga Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3367)|
| 0:56:10| Originally, the applicant was considering a multifamily development, which is why RN4 was requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3370)|
| 0:56:17| Since then, the applicant changed their plans and revised their request to RN3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3377)|
| 0:56:22| which does not permit multifamily, but can consider townhouse development through the special use process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3382)|
| 0:56:36| So, this property is in an area that's predominantly RN2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3396)|
| 0:56:39| though it is adjacent to an RN5 parcel, which is an outlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3399)|
| 0:56:42| and there are two RN5 apartment communities at the edge of the neighborhood to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3402)|
| 0:56:49| So, the Oakwood-Lincoln Park neighborhood plan adopted in 2006| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3409)|
| 0:56:54| describes how multi-unit housing should be designed in a way that's compatible with the surrounding neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3414)|
| 0:56:59| This sentiment is codified in the infill housing overlay that was added for this area in 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3419)|
| 0:57:11| which describes how multi-unit housing, which is how a townhouse development would be considered in this overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3431)|
| 0:57:17| would need to be designed to continue the architectural rhythm of the block, the build-to line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3437)|
| 0:57:23| The parking should be in the rear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3443)|
| 0:57:26| So, what was presented at Planning Commission last month would not have been permitted, just to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3446)|
| 0:57:32| Also, what is existing next door, that apartment complex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3452)|
| 0:57:39| would not be something that's permitted according to our standards now, either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3459)|
| 0:57:44| So, we are recommending approving RN3 because there are multiple layers of review for townhouse development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3464)|
| 0:57:51| should that be proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3471)|
| 0:57:52| There's the Design Review Board, which would apply the infill guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3472)|
| 0:57:56| There's the Special Use Review, which also takes into account neighborhood compatibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3476)|
| 0:58:02| and impacts on traffic and adjacent properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3482)|
| 0:58:05| And then there's the Principal Use Standards, which do affect the materials that can be used and the facade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3485)|
| 0:58:15| and those would be applied both during special use and at the permitting stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3495)|
| 0:58:20| So, because of these numerous compatibility reviews,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3500)|
| 0:58:24| and the fact that this property is located near numerous recreational, educational, commercial, and transit amenities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3504)|
| 0:58:32| we are recommending approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3512)|
| 0:58:35| Would they come before Planning Commission to get special use approval first, or go to DRB first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3515)|
| 0:58:44| We would typically recommend that they go through the Design Review Board and get a COA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3524)|
| 0:58:54| Sorry, we would recommend that they go through the Design Review Board first and have the COA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3534)|
| 0:58:59| and we coordinate a pre-review with the Principal Use Standards as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3539)|
| 0:59:03| so they're aware of the different standards by which it would be evaluated by the Planning Commission too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3543)|
| 0:59:19| This last item is item number 24, 8F23RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3559)|
| 0:59:24| This is a 20.67-acre parcel in the county on Tipton Station Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3564)|
| 0:59:29| which is a major collector street just south of Governor Johnsonville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3569)|
| 0:59:33| The request is to rezone from agricultural to planned residential with a density of up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3573)|
| 0:59:42| Much of the surrounding zoning is agricultural, but there are numerous PR zone subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3582)|
| 0:59:46| ranging in densities of three to five dwelling units per acre that are in close proximity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3586)|
| 0:59:52| This property is in the planned growth area of the Growth Policy Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3592)|
| 0:59:55| The South County Sector Planned Land Use Classification is low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3595)|
| 0:59:59| which permits consideration of PR up to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3599)|
| 1:00:02| The subject property also has a stream protection overlay at its southwest corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3602)|
| 1:00:07| where there is a stream that feeds into Stock Creek to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3607)|
| 1:00:11| PR zoning is designed to accommodate these kinds of environmental constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3611)|
| 1:00:18| As you can see in this aerial view, there has been concentrated residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3618)|
| 1:00:24| In the immediate area, the subject property is actually a bit of an outlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3624)|
| 1:00:29| considering that it's a large agricultural lot next to a high school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3629)|
| 1:00:32| and among numerous subdivisions along Tipton Station Road and Coatney Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3632)|
| 1:00:40| Staff are recommending approval of the PR zone up to five dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3640)|
| 1:00:44| because it's consistent with surrounding development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3644)|
| 1:00:46| as there are six PR zone subdivisions in close proximity between three and five dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3646)|
| 1:00:53| With all of these residential subdivisions, there is full utility infrastructure here with sewer and water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3653)|
| 1:01:00| This property has walkable access, as you can see in this image.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3660)|
| 1:01:04| There are sidewalks extending to the high school to the east, to Bonnie K Elementary School to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3664)|
| 1:01:11| There is a Greenway Trail, which is essentially a sidewalk leading to a library,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3671)|
| 1:01:19| and there's also a park with a playground and soccer field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3679)|
| 1:01:22| So given the close proximity to all of these community facilities and the development pattern here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3682)|
| 1:01:30| we are recommending approval. There has been a lot of community concern about this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3690)|
| 1:01:36| The major concerns have been school capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3696)|
| 1:01:39| So I'll just remind everyone that we do provide these types of residential rezoning reports to the relevant school districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3699)|
| 1:01:47| and they have an opportunity to engage in this planning process should they have capacity concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3707)|
| 1:01:54| With regards to traffic, any development plan that's over 750 daily trips would have to go through a traffic impact study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3714)|
| 1:02:04| and improvements may need to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| And then residential character would also be a part of the development plan review criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3726)|
| 1:02:12| That would be a public process as well, allowing public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3732)|
| 1:02:16| I'm happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3736)|
| 1:02:27| Jesse, on the property across Tipton Station that on one of the maps here says it's one to four dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3747)|
| 1:02:41| is that built out to four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3761)|
| 1:02:47| I would need to verify that, and I can follow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3767)|
| 1:02:51| Yeah, I'm just curious about the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3771)|
| 1:02:54| Looks like there's a one to three and a one to four, but that doesn't necessarily mean the build out is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3774)|
| 1:03:02| And there's also a PR at five on the other side of South Doyle High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3782)|
| 1:03:08| Is that the water tower signal station switch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3788)|
| 1:03:14| Is that development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3794)|
| 1:03:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3795)|
| 1:03:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3796)|
| 1:03:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3797)|
| 1:03:22| Now I'll turn it over to Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3802)|
| 1:03:25| This is item number 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3805)|
| 1:03:27| It's 7G23RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3807)|
| 1:03:29| We talked about this a little bit last month, but there was an error in the staff report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3809)|
| 1:03:35| so the applicant indicated that they were asking for the front portion of the property that zoned PR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3815)|
| 1:03:42| when in actuality it was supposed to be the rear portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3822)|
| 1:03:45| So they asked to postpone it, and we've corrected the staff report to show all of the changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3825)|
| 1:03:52| So I'll just be really brief, again, because the reasoning is the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3832)|
| 1:03:55| It's just the section of the parcel that's being rezoned that's changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3835)|
| 1:03:59| So the applicant's asking to go from PR with a density of 12 dwelling units per acre to the CA zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3839)|
| 1:04:06| It's on Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3846)|
| 1:04:08| This is Brakeville Road right here, and it turns into Neal's Landing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3848)|
| 1:04:11| just to kind of give you the lay of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3851)|
| 1:04:14| The zoning map, you can see that this parcel is outlined in yellow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3854)|
| 1:04:17| It's only a partial rezoning, that rear PR portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3857)|
| 1:04:20| So it's got dual zoning on it with CA here in the middle, PR, and then PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3860)|
| 1:04:26| In looking at past rezoning cases, there's been a number of rezonings to various different zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3866)|
| 1:04:32| but you can see along Asheville Highway a lot of commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3872)|
| 1:04:37| Sector plan map, same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3877)|
| 1:04:40| It's a big swath of CC, community commercial, which lists CA as zone to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3880)|
| 1:04:47| And the existing land use shows that a variety of uses is prevalent along Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3887)|
| 1:04:53| So there's commercial, office, a little bit of industrial over here, some public, quasi-public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3893)|
| 1:04:58| and then a lot of undeveloped land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3898)|
| 1:05:01| Most of the residential development is alongside streets off of Asheville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3901)|
| 1:05:07| Looking at street view, you can see that it is obviously geared towards heavy traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3907)|
| 1:05:12| It is a classified roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3912)|
| 1:05:15| It's got divided median for turn lanes and things like that, which makes it ideal for commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3915)|
| 1:05:21| However, it does abut some residential properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3921)|
| 1:05:24| This one's currently under development, and this one's, as you can see, built out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3924)|
| 1:05:29| And there is, however, well, kind of back up in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3929)|
| 1:05:33| So right now it's kind of located at a small commercial node.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3933)|
| 1:05:36| There's a food city and some other commercial development directly across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3936)|
| 1:05:42| There is a stream that kind of comes along through here along the northern property line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3942)|
| 1:05:46| and then another one that comes down from north down to this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3946)|
| 1:05:49| But you can see a little bit better without the case turned on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3949)|
| 1:05:54| So those streams provide a natural barrier between the commercial property and the residential properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3954)|
| 1:06:00| And then also it should be noted that the applicant would need to meet the requirements of the Knox County Stormwater Ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3960)|
| 1:06:05| and that would be reviewed during the design phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3965)|
| 1:06:08| I know that's some of the concerns that the neighbors have is the potential for flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3968)|
| 1:06:12| And this is just, again, to kind of turn those layers off so you can see more clearly where the stream lies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3972)|
| 1:06:17| And then just you can kind of see from the street view the property's pretty flat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3977)|
| 1:06:22| and then this stream kind of follows back through here, so no site constraints or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3982)|
| 1:06:27| And I'm happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3987)|
| 1:06:30| Is there a non-disturbance buffer that they have around that stream?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3990)|
| 1:06:35| Yes. Yeah, there would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3995)|
| 1:06:37| Since it's county, it would be a 25-foot buffer on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=3997)|
| 1:06:46| Thank you, Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4006)|
| 1:06:48| Turn it over to Whitney to cover 8J23RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4008)|
| 1:07:15| Okay, so number 27, 8J23RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4035)|
| 1:07:19| This is a rezoning request in an existing subdivision that is zoned RAE Exclusive Residential to RA Low Density Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4039)|
| 1:07:31| The lot is 33,163 square feet or 0.76 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4051)|
| 1:07:39| It's along River Drive, which is a local road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4059)|
| 1:07:43| It's just Asheville Highway on the Clinch River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4063)|
| 1:07:49| This property is within the planned growth area, and the sector plan is LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4069)|
| 1:07:55| This is somewhere that RAE can be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4075)|
| 1:07:58| That's also within the 100-year FEMA floodplain and hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4078)|
| 1:08:04| There have been no RAE rezonings in this area in recent years to warrant a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4084)|
| 1:08:10| The only existing RAE zoning within the subdivision is at Church at the end of the block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4090)|
| 1:08:16| It has access to Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4096)|
| 1:08:18| It's on a much larger lot than any of the other single-family residences within the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4098)|
| 1:08:25| In the RAE zone, the minimum lot size for a lot with a single-family dwelling is 20,000 square feet if sewer is not provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4105)|
| 1:08:35| The RAE zone allows duplexes and garage apartments on the same lot as a house with a use-on review approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4115)|
| 1:08:43| and that's what the applicant intends to do is build a garage apartment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4123)|
| 1:08:48| Built out at a maximum capacity, this lot could be developed with up to one additional unit at 2.63 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4128)|
| 1:09:00| And so the recommendation is to deny the LDR because, or deny, yeah, deny the low-density residential zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4140)|
| 1:09:09| because it's inconsistent with the surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4149)|
| 1:09:13| Despite the fact that it does, it is aligned with the adopted plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4153)|
| 1:09:18| we're not recommending approval since it's out of character with the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4158)|
| 1:09:22| and it doesn't meet all the criteria of the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4162)|
| 1:09:25| In particular, the proposed amendment shall be necessary because of the substantially changed or changing conditions in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4165)|
| 1:09:33| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4173)|
| 1:09:40| Thank you, Whitney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4180)|
| 1:09:46| We're going to move on to agenda item number nine, 8D23RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4186)|
| 1:10:06| This request is to rezone the property on Sanders Lane from RN2 to the RN4 district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4206)|
| 1:10:13| The property is in East Knoxville within the boundary of Morningside Heights Homeowners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4213)|
| 1:10:20| It's located south of the 5.3 development by KCDC, the red highlighted area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4220)|
| 1:10:27| This property is an area that's predominantly RN2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4227)|
| 1:10:31| though it is adjacent to an RN6 zoned 5.3 development parcel to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4231)|
| 1:10:38| The land use classification is traditional neighborhood residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4238)|
| 1:10:43| which permits consideration of RN4 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4243)|
| 1:10:48| The neighborhood primarily comprises single-family units, however, north of the subject property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4248)|
| 1:10:55| there are two duplexes on the RN2 parcel, which align with the dimensional standards of the RN3 district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4255)|
| 1:11:03| This portion, the west portion of the 5.3 development parcel is a forested hillside, as you can see in the aerial image.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4263)|
| 1:11:20| According to the slope analysis, 26% of this property should remain undisturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4280)|
| 1:11:27| The access road Sanders Lane is only about 12 feet wide and it terminates at the north end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4287)|
| 1:11:33| The connection to Bethel Avenue was closed recently when KCDC started the development along Bethel Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4293)|
| 1:11:42| Staff recommends approving RN3 instead of RN4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4302)|
| 1:11:47| RN3 zoning at this location will allow development that is consistent with the duplexes to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4307)|
| 1:11:54| At the same time, RN3's restrictive density and building height will be more suitable for the single-family dwellings in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4314)|
| 1:12:02| The narrow street and sloped side are more suitable, more compatible with the density allowed by the RN3 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4322)|
| 1:12:11| As an additional context, the property owner is intending to build five townhouses and trying to get a reduced rear setback variance from BCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4331)|
| 1:12:20| As you can see, the maximum allowed dwelling units and building heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4340)|
| 1:12:28| Do you have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4348)|
| 1:12:33| Just a couple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4353)|
| 1:12:35| Did you say that they're actively trying to get variances with BCA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4355)|
| 1:12:40| Yes, they have an application for the month of August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4360)|
| 1:12:44| I'm also kind of unrelated to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4364)|
| 1:12:46| I noticed there's a historic overlay, like a few parcels over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4366)|
| 1:12:54| Just out of curiosity, what is the purpose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4374)|
| 1:12:59| Does anybody know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4379)|
| 1:13:02| Looks like a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4382)|
| 1:13:06| Okay, I thought it was vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4386)|
| 1:13:13| On the historic map, this is one I've wondered about and not been able to find too much research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4393)|
| 1:13:19| It says underground railroad site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4399)|
| 1:13:22| Yeah, so it's that L-shaped property that fronts Fuller Avenue and then crosses over to McConnell Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4402)|
| 1:13:29| I haven't been able to find a bunch of information on that one in our files, but I will look into that further and follow up with you because it's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4409)|
| 1:13:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4418)|
| 1:13:48| We'll turn it over to Mr. Reynolds for the next three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4428)|
| 1:13:51| Item number 25, 30, and 32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4431)|
| 1:14:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4445)|
| 1:14:09| HE23RZ, this request is for rezoning from agricultural to RB general residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4449)|
| 1:14:18| The staff recommendation is to deny the RB because it is inconsistent with the growth policy plan, which I'll show you in just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4458)|
| 1:14:24| As you can see, actually make this bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4464)|
| 1:14:27| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4467)|
| 1:14:31| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4471)|
| 1:14:34| Get my laser pointer on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4474)|
| 1:14:37| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4477)|
| 1:14:39| Property is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4479)|
| 1:14:40| It's currently, so this is the existing land use map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4480)|
| 1:14:43| This is in the rural area in the growth policy plan, but it is built out with significant amount of single family residential type uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4483)|
| 1:14:51| Zoning wise, it is compatible with the growth policy plan, with the exception of the RB zoning that's adjacent to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4491)|
| 1:15:02| So here's the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4502)|
| 1:15:05| Nearby is the planned growth area, but it is disconnected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4505)|
| 1:15:13| So this subdivision is zoned planned residential up to three dwelling units per acre, which I'll show you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4513)|
| 1:15:19| That was rezoned just after the growth policy plan was adopted in the year 2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4519)|
| 1:15:26| It did only go up to three dwelling units per acre, which was the maximum allowed, which is still the maximum allowed by the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4526)|
| 1:15:35| Separate rezoning happened earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4535)|
| 1:15:38| Sorry, last year, 2022 was this RA property, which is in the rural area, but adjacent to the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4538)|
| 1:15:47| RA zoning is not recommended in the rural area in the growth policy plan, but it was approved through county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4547)|
| 1:15:58| RB zoning, which is what they're requesting, is not allowed in the growth policy plan rural area either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4558)|
| 1:16:08| Kind of a unique situation here with this site is it is in the low density residential land use classification in the sector plan, which typically we don't see in the rural area in the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4568)|
| 1:16:21| Low density residential would allow consideration of RA zoning, but the growth policy plan designation does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4581)|
| 1:16:30| Just a real quick overview of what the property looks like and its surrounding, but it is surrounded by neighborhoods that are single family uses for the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4590)|
| 1:16:42| Anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4602)|
| 1:16:56| The next one, and I want to mainly go over this because the staff report came to you late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4616)|
| 1:17:03| This is SA23C, so this is a modification to an approved subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4623)|
| 1:17:11| So what you're seeing and highlighted in red is the area that they're changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4631)|
| 1:17:16| The rest of the subdivision was originally adopted or approved in 2018 for 119 detached lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4636)|
| 1:17:24| It also had 22 foot wide roads and 40 foot right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4644)|
| 1:17:29| So basically the portion of the property already developed, so it was substantially within the hillside protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4649)|
| 1:17:36| So the reduced road widths and right of way widths was an attempt to help reduce the amount of disturbance required for the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4656)|
| 1:17:45| This phase two portion, they're changing to attached units, is largely outside of the hillside protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4665)|
| 1:17:52| So it's really not the reduced pavement widths and right of way widths are less important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4672)|
| 1:18:00| In 2020, staff approved a modification to the original subdivision, reducing the road length here, which crossed the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4680)|
| 1:18:08| Also reduced the number of lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4688)|
| 1:18:10| And then in 2022, we administratively approved a few more lots at the end of Jumping Jack Lane, which they show on their plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4690)|
| 1:18:21| Ultimately, this will reduce detached lots by 39, have 57 attached lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4701)|
| 1:18:28| So it's a 18 lot increase somewhere on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4708)|
| 1:18:34| And this new section is going to have 26 foot wide roads with a 50 foot right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4714)|
| 1:18:40| This is just showing what the original plan looked like versus what they're proposing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4720)|
| 1:18:47| So condition number four, this is so you know, if you're reading through the conditions and get kind of confused on what this is talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4727)|
| 1:18:53| Basically, I'm asking them to provide an updated concept plan to staff that shows the accurate area zoned planned residential on their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4733)|
| 1:19:07| So what's the showing here is their survey shows a 44 plus acre tract, which is what they stated on their on their plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4747)|
| 1:19:18| But that includes some of the public right away, which is shown in blue and also a little area zoned agricultural in the southwest corner of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4758)|
| 1:19:26| So those are not zoned planned residential or not. Their property does not impact their request with density or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4766)|
| 1:19:32| Just want to get accurate information. So we all know going forward how much actual planned residential zone they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4772)|
| 1:19:44| So there's a couple of variants, a variance and alternative design standard that we are trying to work out with the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4784)|
| 1:19:52| So they are this is only a part of the subdivision, but everything in blue, that kind of tick there is a frontage less than 20 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4792)|
| 1:20:01| Anything that's in red is a frontage between 20 and 25 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4801)|
| 1:20:07| Both of those things require different types of approval by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4807)|
| 1:20:12| So for attached houses, the planning commission can approve a lot frontage less than 25 feet, which is typically the minimum amount allowed for residential lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4812)|
| 1:20:24| If guest parking is provided. Here they're not providing a they're not creating off street guest parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4824)|
| 1:20:34| But I'll show you in a moment what they have provided to justify the reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4834)|
| 1:20:41| So the lots are less than 20 feet, have less than 25 feet of frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4841)|
| 1:20:46| Those require a variance technically through the planning commission. Alternative design standards and variances are just a little bit differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4846)|
| 1:20:53| But ultimately, the intent here is that we want to make sure that guest parking can be provided and that the frontage that they are providing can adequately adequately serve the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4853)|
| 1:21:03| So the driveway, utility access and that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4863)|
| 1:21:10| They do show on this plan that they can accommodate about 17 parking spaces, this curbside, so on street parking, essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4870)|
| 1:21:26| A lot of attached to residential developments is you can't find hardly any on street parking opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4886)|
| 1:21:32| But the way of this development has the roads that curve and the separation between units that actually can provide some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4892)|
| 1:21:39| So that's part of the reason why they provided the 26 foot wide road, because if they provide a 22 foot wide road, you really can't provide on street like real true on street parking without causing some problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4899)|
| 1:21:54| So they went with a wider road so that on street parking became more feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4914)|
| 1:22:04| Anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4924)|
| 1:22:06| Are these private roads?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4926)|
| 1:22:08| They're public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4928)|
| 1:22:09| So what I'm showing is on street parking. It's really this curbside, this parking on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4929)|
| 1:22:18| There's not sidewalks in this section that I can tell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4938)|
| 1:22:22| There's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4942)|
| 1:22:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4953)|
| 1:22:35| Number 32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4955)|
| 1:22:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4956)|
| 1:22:37| Number 32. It's a a 23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4957)|
| 1:22:40| You are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4960)|
| 1:22:41| So the request is for three duplexes in the R.A. zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4961)|
| 1:22:45| R.A. zone requires you some review approval for duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4965)|
| 1:22:49| There's a minimum lot size of 12000 square feet, which these all meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4969)|
| 1:22:55| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4975)|
| 1:22:56| Lot number one, which is the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4976)|
| 1:22:59| South side, the lower part of this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4979)|
| 1:23:04| Is there proposing to access their existing access easement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4984)|
| 1:23:08| There's a couple of properties behind that use this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4988)|
| 1:23:13| Lots two and three, which would be new lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4993)|
| 1:23:16| Would access through a shared permit access easement through the property on Belt Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=4996)|
| 1:23:21| That property owner is in agreement to allow that easement and driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=5001)|
| 1:23:27| Issue that we run into is with the three duplexes, they actually exceed the five dwelling at Prager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=5007)|
| 1:23:35| Maximum density allowed in the low density residential land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=5015)|
| 1:23:39| So staff is recommending that we approve or the planning commission approve duplexes for two lots, lots two and three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=5019)|
| 1:23:47| And basically a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=5027)|
| 1:23:48| One just would not be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=5028)|
| 1:23:50| That would bring the density down below five dollars per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=5030)|
| 1:23:53| They could still build a single family house on that lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=5033)|
| 1:23:56| And that then that that that lot would then, I guess, the access that they're using would be more consistent with the existing access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=5036)|
| 1:24:05| There's a there's already a home on that property, so that the type of access really wouldn't change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=5045)|
| 1:24:10| Then the other property owners that use that access easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=5050)|
| 1:24:15| Just real quick zoning, you see this zone already within the general vicinity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=5055)|
| 1:24:20| This is in South Knoxville, by the way, not too far from Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=5060)|
| 1:24:26| Low density residential in the land use plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=5066)|
| 1:24:28| It's going to give you an idea about what's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=5068)|
| 1:24:31| This is the driveway that the that the property currently uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=5071)|
| 1:24:35| There is the house behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=5075)|
| 1:24:37| And then there's this lot back here that does not have a house on it, but does use that for access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=5077)|
| 1:24:44| And there's also a single family house in front of this lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=5084)|
| 1:24:49| So the other two duplexes would go here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=5089)|
| 1:24:55| So it's a shared permanent easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=5095)|
| 1:24:57| What they'll have to create is a shared permanent access easement for the two new lots behind going through the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=5097)|
| 1:25:07| The applicant used to own this lot along Belt Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=5107)|
| 1:25:11| The current property owner has an agreement to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=5111)|
| 1:25:14| When they sold that lot, they created an access easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=5114)|
| 1:25:17| But the type of access easement they created wasn't sufficient to allow two new lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=5117)|
| 1:25:22| It only allowed one lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=5122)|
| 1:25:23| So they're going to change that to a shared permanent access easement instead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=5123)|
| 1:25:27| And that type of easement can be used for up to how many lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=5127)|
| 1:25:31| Five, five, including the lot that it crosses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=5131)|
| 1:25:34| So does that consider like it could be five duplexes theoretically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=5134)|
| 1:25:39| Or is it there's not there's really not enough land back there for more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=5139)|
| 1:25:43| But right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=5143)|
| 1:25:44| Technically, yes, they could be used for duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=5144)|
| 1:25:54| Thank you, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=5154)|
| 1:25:56| Are there any other items that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=5156)|
| 1:25:59| Commission would like to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=5159)|
| 1:26:05| Your adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-230808-agenda-review?start=5165)|
