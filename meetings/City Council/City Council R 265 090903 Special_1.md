| 1:57:09| and I take her to the parks all the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7029)|
| 1:57:11| I am a gun owner and I have a carry permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7031)|
| 1:57:13| A lot of people talk about people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7033)|
| 1:57:15| being a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7035)|
| 1:57:17| and I just want to bring to the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7037)|
| 1:57:19| the account of two times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7039)|
| 1:57:21| with my daughter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7041)|
| 1:57:23| at the Seven Islands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7043)|
| 1:57:25| and at Iams Nature Trail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7045)|
| 1:57:27| Though there are people in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7047)|
| 1:57:29| who are irresponsible pet owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7049)|
| 1:57:31| and twice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7051)|
| 1:57:33| while I've had my daughter at the parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7053)|
| 1:57:35| I have been charged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7055)|
| 1:57:37| by several large dogs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7057)|
| 1:57:39| and not just for people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7059)|
| 1:57:41| but I would like to be able to protect my daughter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7061)|
| 1:57:43| from a stray dog that can kill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7063)|
| 1:57:45| or maim my daughter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7065)|
| 1:57:47| Now I don't know if people have heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7067)|
| 1:57:49| on the news about an elderly couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7069)|
| 1:57:51| on a walking trail that were mauled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7071)|
| 1:57:53| and killed by stray dogs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7073)|
| 1:57:55| They weren't coyotes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7075)|
| 1:57:57| They weren't coyotes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7077)|
| 1:57:59| They weren't wolves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7079)|
| 1:58:01| They were just wild dogs turned out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7081)|
| 1:58:03| and these people died| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7083)|
| 1:58:05| because of someone's irresponsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7085)|
| 1:58:07| to take care of their animals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7087)|

| 1:58:13| Hans Kamowski| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7093)|
| 1:58:15| Please state your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7095)|
| 1:58:17| for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7097)|
| 1:58:19| Matthew Rogers, 820 Zole Lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7099)|
| 1:58:21| I'm not a city of Knoxville resident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7101)|
| 1:58:23| but I was born here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7103)|
| 1:58:25| Just some of my thoughts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7105)|
| 1:58:27| I just kind of jotted down from listening tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7107)|
| 1:58:29| Some of the things that have been said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7109)|
| 1:58:31| such as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7111)|
| 1:58:33| the revoking stats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7113)|
| 1:58:35| If you actually look them up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7115)|
| 1:58:37| there's usually over 200 permits revoked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7117)|
| 1:58:39| each year. Well, the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7119)|
| 1:58:41| doesn't differentiate from something that's revoked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7121)|
| 1:58:43| and then put back in, restated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7123)|
| 1:58:45| If you get a restraining order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7125)|
| 1:58:47| against someone or something like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7127)|
| 1:58:49| an order of protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7129)|
| 1:58:51| it's automatic suspension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7131)|
| 1:58:53| but the state of Tennessee calls it revoked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7133)|
| 1:58:55| You know, when you look things up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7135)|
| 1:58:57| in 2006| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7137)|
| 1:58:59| I believe there were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7139)|
| 1:59:01| here in Knox County, there were two crimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7141)|
| 1:59:03| that were violent that had revoked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7143)|
| 1:59:05| Neither one that I could find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7145)|
| 1:59:07| had anything to do with a gun| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7147)|
| 1:59:09| Permit holders, I'm sure you've heard the stats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7149)|
| 1:59:11| I've sent y'all stats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7151)|
| 1:59:13| are law-abiding citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7153)|
| 1:59:15| They are of pretty much every state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7155)|
| 1:59:17| Yes, there's bad apples, but you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7157)|
| 1:59:19| You're going to get that anywhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7159)|
| 1:59:21| I don't see us revoking all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7161)|
| 1:59:23| driving licenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7163)|
| 1:59:25| 31 other states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7165)|
| 1:59:27| allow people to carry in local parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7167)|
| 1:59:29| 31| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7169)|
| 1:59:31| When I looked it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7171)|
| 1:59:33| I couldn't find one story| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7173)|
| 1:59:35| where someone got shot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7175)|
| 1:59:37| by a permit holder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7177)|
| 1:59:39| In fact, I found it pretty hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7179)|
| 1:59:41| to find any story about anyone getting shot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7181)|
| 1:59:43| even by a non-permit holder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7183)|
| 1:59:45| Just some thoughts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7185)|
| 1:59:47| My wife was walking in a Knox County park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7187)|
| 1:59:49| about two months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7189)|
| 1:59:51| found a shotgun shell that was used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7191)|
| 1:59:53| and had been used pretty recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7193)|
| 1:59:55| Guns are there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7195)|
| 1:59:57| I've been a permit holder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7197)|
| 1:59:59| for just over two months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7199)|
| 2:00:01| The day I got my permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7201)|
| 2:00:03| was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7203)|
| 2:00:05| wonderful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7205)|
| 2:00:07| I feel protected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7207)|
| 2:00:09| But you know what? It doesn't really matter if I feel safe with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7209)|
| 2:00:11| Safety only matters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7211)|
| 2:00:13| if you're really safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7213)|
| 2:00:15| I can feel safe without a gun| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7215)|
| 2:00:17| but that doesn't matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7217)|
| 2:00:19| Am I really safe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7219)|
| 2:00:21| It's said that it would become the wild, wild west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7221)|
| 2:00:23| I saw that in a Tennessean article yesterday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7223)|
| 2:00:25| It hasn't happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7225)|
| 2:00:31| There are sports at churches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7231)|
| 2:00:33| all the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7233)|
| 2:00:35| Mine's won in West Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7235)|
| 2:00:37| No shootings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7237)|
| 2:00:39| Why is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7239)|
| 2:00:41| I carried to a state park last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7241)|
| 2:00:43| No problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7243)|
| 2:00:45| Everyone's nice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7245)|
| 2:00:47| No problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7247)|
| 2:00:49| So why do we want to take away our rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7249)|
| 2:00:51| to protect ourselves?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7251)|
| 2:00:53| That's all we're asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7253)|
| 2:00:55| We just want to protect ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7255)|
| 2:00:57| if we get in that situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7257)|
| 2:00:59| The chance of getting in that situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7259)|
| 2:01:01| Not likely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7261)|
| 2:01:03| But you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7263)|
| 2:01:05| I have to walk back to my car here in a little while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7265)|
| 2:01:07| My gun's in my car| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7267)|
| 2:01:09| because I can't carry it here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7269)|
| 2:01:11| Do you want to look someone like the Newsom family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7271)|
| 2:01:13| and say, oh I'm sorry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7273)|
| 2:01:15| your child was killed in one of our parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7275)|
| 2:01:17| because they had their permit but they couldn't carry it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7277)|
| 2:01:19| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7279)|
| 2:01:25| Our last speaker, Heinz Himowski| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7285)|
| 2:01:27| and I hope I got that pronounced right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7287)|
| 2:01:29| Please state your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7289)|

| 2:01:33| My name's Heinz Himowski| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7293)|
| 2:01:35| I'm at 3313 Harris Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7295)|
| 2:01:37| and I just wanted to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7297)|
| 2:01:39| I hate carrying a gun| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7299)|
| 2:01:41| It's a nuisance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7301)|

| 2:02:05| pretty much throughout history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7325)|

| 2:02:13| protect themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7333)|

| 2:02:17| you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7337)|

| 2:02:23| but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7343)|
| 2:02:25| I just found| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7345)|
| 2:02:27| in a perfect world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7347)|
| 2:02:29| I wouldn't want a gun| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7349)|
| 2:02:31| I'd throw them all away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7351)|
| 2:02:33| Unfortunately bad things happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7353)|
| 2:02:35| and I don't want them to happen to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7355)|

| 2:02:45| I've got a spare tire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7365)|
| 2:02:47| and we've got doctors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7367)|
| 2:02:49| hopefully nobody ever gets sick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7369)|
| 2:02:51| but it happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7371)|
| 2:02:53| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7373)|

| 2:03:23| I'd like to thank all the good people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7403)|
| 2:03:25| who are here on both sides of the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7405)|
| 2:03:27| there's been some valid points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7407)|
| 2:03:29| made, concerns from both sides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7409)|
| 2:03:31| and I think we've all heard that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7411)|
| 2:03:33| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7413)|
| 2:03:35| just want to point out that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7415)|

| 2:03:45| but thank you for all your service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7425)|
| 2:03:47| and to the Parks and Greenway representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7427)|

| 2:03:51| recreation greenway systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7431)|
| 2:03:53| in the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7433)|
| 2:03:55| and some of you are here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7435)|
| 2:03:57| partly responsible for that anyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7437)|
| 2:04:01| When I looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7441)|
| 2:04:03| this issue of guns in the parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7443)|
| 2:04:05| first of all I thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7445)|
| 2:04:07| the name itself is sort of curious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7447)|
| 2:04:09| and I thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7449)|
| 2:04:11| at first blush, well that's not a very good thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7451)|
| 2:04:13| to jump on the bandwagon for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7453)|
| 2:04:15| so I started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7455)|
| 2:04:17| to look into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7457)|
| 2:04:19| issue itself and the statistics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7459)|
| 2:04:21| and the facts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7461)|
| 2:04:23| and exactly what's been going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7463)|
| 2:04:25| and what it looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7465)|
| 2:04:27| and I think that's our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7467)|
| 2:04:29| responsibility tonight is to look at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7469)|
| 2:04:31| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7471)|
| 2:04:33| to take in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7473)|
| 2:04:35| the facts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7475)|
| 2:04:37| and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7477)|
| 2:04:39| as I've looked into the facts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7479)|
| 2:04:41| I think it's misnamed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7481)|
| 2:04:43| and I looked into who named it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7483)|
| 2:04:45| and I guess it's been named through the media| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7485)|
| 2:04:47| and in my view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7487)|
| 2:04:49| after having looked at the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7489)|
| 2:04:51| I think it more aptly should be named| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7491)|
| 2:04:53| in respect of right to defend yourself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7493)|
| 2:04:55| or the second amendment right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7495)|
| 2:04:57| or right to something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7497)|
| 2:04:59| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7499)|
| 2:05:01| so I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7501)|
| 2:05:03| all of us ought to continue to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7503)|
| 2:05:05| listen and look at these facts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7505)|
| 2:05:07| and I had a couple of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7507)|
| 2:05:09| and a couple of final comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7509)|
| 2:05:11| First of all, Mike, could somebody from your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7511)|

| 2:05:17| to get a permit, what the process is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7517)|
| 2:05:23| My name is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7523)|

| 2:05:29| There's a statute specifically that details this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7529)|
| 2:05:31| It's 39-17-13-51| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7531)|

| 2:05:35| things that are required to obtain a permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7535)|
| 2:05:37| I can read these to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7537)|

| 2:05:45| First of all, I have to state a few simple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7545)|

| 2:05:55| In addition to that and the things that you're looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7555)|
| 2:05:57| for, first of all, you cannot have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7557)|

| 2:06:45| United States citizenship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7605)|
| 2:06:47| You cannot have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7607)|
| 2:06:49| convicted of a misdemeanor crime or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7609)|
| 2:06:51| domestic violence, and then it cites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7611)|
| 2:06:53| a certain provision of the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7613)|
| 2:06:55| And the last one is you cannot have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7615)|
| 2:06:57| convicted of the offense of stalking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7617)|
| 2:06:59| So there's quite a list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7619)|
| 2:07:01| of things that you cannot have committed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7621)|
| 2:07:03| and I think there's one point that hasn't really been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7623)|
| 2:07:05| made fully here tonight, and that is this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7625)|
| 2:07:07| Not only do they ask you on this application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7627)|
| 2:07:09| have you committed these crimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7629)|
| 2:07:11| They do require a TBI background check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7631)|
| 2:07:13| to include fingerprinting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7633)|
| 2:07:15| And that information is also sent off to the FBI| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7635)|
| 2:07:17| So it's not just a matter of trusting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7637)|
| 2:07:19| the citizenry to fill out the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7639)|
| 2:07:21| properly, they actually enforce it as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7641)|
| 2:07:23| How about training? Did you mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7643)|
| 2:07:25| training? I didn't mention training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7645)|
| 2:07:27| in that section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7647)|
| 2:07:29| But the training, as I recall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7649)|
| 2:07:31| Please correct me if I'm wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7651)|
| 2:07:33| There is a course that you have to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7653)|
| 2:07:35| You have to fire 48 rounds, you heard that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7655)|
| 2:07:37| referenced earlier, you don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7657)|
| 2:07:39| to take recurring training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7659)|
| 2:07:41| In other words, over the life of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7661)|
| 2:07:43| permit, you don't have to train for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7663)|
| 2:07:45| every year thereafter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7665)|
| 2:07:47| You also have to turn in an application to the local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7667)|
| 2:07:49| Sheriff's Department, and they have to approve that application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7669)|
| 2:07:53| Anything else you'd like to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7673)|
| 2:07:55| No, I'll go ahead and email this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7675)|
| 2:07:57| out to you guys, just so you can have it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7677)|
| 2:07:59| yourself, but again, there's a total of 18| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7679)|
| 2:08:01| different requirements, so it's not just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7681)|
| 2:08:03| a bunch of gunslinging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7683)|
| 2:08:05| bloggers out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7685)|
| 2:08:07| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7687)|
| 2:08:09| Just a quick clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7689)|
| 2:08:11| You're prohibited from getting one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7691)|
| 2:08:13| if you have a felony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7693)|
| 2:08:15| That is correct, period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7695)|
| 2:08:17| Somebody stated earlier, your permit can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7697)|
| 2:08:19| revoked for spitting on the sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7699)|
| 2:08:21| Is it true that your permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7701)|
| 2:08:23| can be revoked for anything you do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7703)|
| 2:08:25| or do you have to commit a felony?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7705)|
| 2:08:27| You can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7707)|
| 2:08:29| Again, if you're under indictment for certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7709)|
| 2:08:31| types of misdemeanors, you can also have it revoked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7711)|
| 2:08:33| or suspended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7713)|
| 2:08:35| There is a certain threshold of crime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7715)|
| 2:08:37| you have to commit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7717)|
| 2:08:39| Spitting on the sidewalk doesn't actually count| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7719)|
| 2:08:41| No, that was using reference to gesture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7721)|
| 2:08:43| I have one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7723)|
| 2:08:45| I'm sorry, go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7725)|
| 2:08:47| How long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7727)|
| 2:08:49| is that permit valid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7729)|
| 2:08:51| The permit is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7731)|
| 2:08:53| valid for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7733)|
| 2:08:55| 4 or 5 years, at which time there's a renewal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7735)|
| 2:08:57| fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7737)|
| 2:08:59| It's a fairly simple process to renew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7739)|
| 2:09:01| Again, it's about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7741)|
| 2:09:03| 4 or 5 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7743)|
| 2:09:05| And if I get to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7745)|
| 2:09:07| 85, 86| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7747)|
| 2:09:09| am I called in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7749)|
| 2:09:11| for a physical or do I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7751)|
| 2:09:13| pay my fee and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7753)|
| 2:09:15| my license is renewed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7755)|
| 2:09:17| That's a good question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7757)|
| 2:09:19| One of the items that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7759)|
| 2:09:21| may have accidentally skipped earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7761)|
| 2:09:23| was that you cannot have been adjudicated as a mental defective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7763)|
| 2:09:25| and there's a couple of others to that effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7765)|
| 2:09:29| It's kind of like driving a car| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7769)|
| 2:09:31| if you get to the point where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7771)|
| 2:09:33| a doctor has said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7773)|
| 2:09:35| you're no longer trustworthy for carrying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7775)|
| 2:09:37| something like this, it's just like driving a car| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7777)|
| 2:09:39| in certain circumstances it can be revoked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7779)|
| 2:09:43| Go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7783)|
| 2:09:45| Well, this is just like everything else that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7785)|
| 2:09:47| comes across this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7787)|
| 2:09:49| council member's desk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7789)|
| 2:09:51| I first go to look at what the law states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7791)|
| 2:09:53| and I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7793)|
| 2:09:55| you have the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7795)|
| 2:09:57| the constitutional right, the second amendment right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7797)|
| 2:09:59| to bear arms and to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7799)|
| 2:10:01| defend yourself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7801)|
| 2:10:03| Our federal government has said that it's legal to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7803)|
| 2:10:05| and our state government has said that it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7805)|
| 2:10:07| legal to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7807)|
| 2:10:09| and 6 out of 7 of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7809)|
| 2:10:11| state elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7811)|
| 2:10:13| officials voted for the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7813)|
| 2:10:15| to carry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7815)|
| 2:10:17| and I think that if you do look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7817)|
| 2:10:19| the statistics, it's about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7819)|
| 2:10:21| being more safe, not less safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7821)|
| 2:10:23| and the statistics and the facts back that up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7823)|
| 2:10:27| So that's where I stand on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7827)|
| 2:10:29| and I support the repeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7829)|
| 2:10:31| I know there's members of this council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7831)|
| 2:10:33| that are interested in some discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7833)|
| 2:10:35| I know full well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7835)|
| 2:10:37| what goes on around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7837)|
| 2:10:39| youth sports and parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7839)|
| 2:10:41| about 10 years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7841)|
| 2:10:43| I volunteered to be my nephew's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7843)|
| 2:10:45| little league coach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7845)|
| 2:10:47| and the thing that just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7847)|
| 2:10:49| absolutely amazed me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7849)|
| 2:10:51| and I don't remember this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7851)|
| 2:10:53| when I played little league, is the emotion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7853)|
| 2:10:55| and the compassion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7855)|
| 2:10:57| and it's their kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7857)|
| 2:10:59| and it's amazing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7859)|
| 2:11:01| the emotions that run through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7861)|
| 2:11:03| recreational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7863)|
| 2:11:05| parks where there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7865)|
| 2:11:07| are officials and umpires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7867)|
| 2:11:09| and referees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7869)|
| 2:11:11| and I understand that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7871)|
| 2:11:13| but when it comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7873)|
| 2:11:15| to more of the greenways and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7875)|
| 2:11:17| open areas, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7877)|
| 2:11:19| it's definitely more safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7879)|
| 2:11:21| not safe to allow folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7881)|
| 2:11:23| to in essence be the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7883)|
| 2:11:25| arm of the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7885)|
| 2:11:27| but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7887)|
| 2:11:29| I look forward to listening to others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7889)|
| 2:11:31| comments and furthering this discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7891)|
| 2:11:33| and I know we have two more meetings on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7893)|
| 2:11:35| so I'll leave it there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7895)|
| 2:11:37| Thank you. Mr. Frost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7897)|
| 2:11:39| Thank you. A couple things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7899)|
| 2:11:41| First, I kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7901)|
| 2:11:43| don't get me wrong, I've expressed this in emails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7903)|
| 2:11:45| to people. I think it's, you know, we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7905)|
| 2:11:47| had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7907)|
| 2:11:49| had and have coming up some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7909)|
| 2:11:51| trials for these two unfortunate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7911)|
| 2:11:53| young people that were murdered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7913)|
| 2:11:55| They're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7915)|
| 2:11:57| honestly, they're voiceless victims| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7917)|
| 2:11:59| I'm not aware that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7919)|
| 2:12:01| any of those crimes occurred in parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7921)|
| 2:12:03| I don't know if any of those people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7923)|
| 2:12:05| did or did not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7925)|
| 2:12:07| gun permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7927)|
| 2:12:09| of any sort. So I think it's kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7929)|
| 2:12:11| unfortunate when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7931)|
| 2:12:13| people get drug into a conversation that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7933)|
| 2:12:15| aren't able to speak for themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7935)|
| 2:12:17| when the fact situation doesn't apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7937)|
| 2:12:19| Having said that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7939)|
| 2:12:21| if this gets repealed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7941)|
| 2:12:23| I don't think the Wild West is going to break out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7943)|
| 2:12:25| but likewise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7945)|
| 2:12:27| if it doesn't get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7947)|
| 2:12:29| repealed, I don't think the bad man| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7949)|
| 2:12:31| is around every corner of every park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7951)|

| 2:12:35| I had a question for someone with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7955)|

| 2:12:59| We have secured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7979)|
| 2:13:01| by agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7981)|

| 2:13:05| for many of these greenways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7985)|
| 2:13:07| What's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7987)|
| 2:13:09| possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7989)|

| 2:13:19| 70| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=7999)|

| 2:13:31| if we repeal to those greenways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8011)|
| 2:13:33| Are people going to be coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8013)|
| 2:13:35| and saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8015)|
| 2:13:37| I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8017)|
| 2:13:39| going along with this easement anymore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8019)|
| 2:13:41| I don't want guns passing across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8021)|
| 2:13:43| my property because let's be honest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8023)|
| 2:13:45| here, in just that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8025)|
| 2:13:47| one greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8027)|

| 2:13:51| Sutherland Avenue, there's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8031)|
| 2:13:53| at least one person who will object| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8033)|
| 2:13:55| What do we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8035)|
| 2:13:57| Are we going to have a greenway here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8037)|
| 2:13:59| stop, pick up again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8039)|
| 2:14:01| with someone who's fine with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8041)|
| 2:14:03| stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8043)|
| 2:14:05| What's going to go on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8045)|
| 2:14:07| What's going to happen to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8047)|
| 2:14:09| greenway system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8049)|
| 2:14:11| Anybody from Parks and Rec, Greenways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8051)|
| 2:14:13| or Deputy Law Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8053)|
| 2:14:15| want to weigh in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8055)|
| 2:14:23| It would depend on the individual easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8063)|
| 2:14:25| I would have to refer to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8065)|
| 2:14:27| the specific language of the easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8067)|
| 2:14:29| I can't give a definitive answer on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8069)|
| 2:14:31| but it would depend on the easement itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8071)|
| 2:14:35| If we have an easement across somebody's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8075)|
| 2:14:37| property and this is repealed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8077)|
| 2:14:39| and they say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8079)|
| 2:14:41| I don't believe in guns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8081)|
| 2:14:43| whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8083)|
| 2:14:45| I mean, are we going to force people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8085)|
| 2:14:47| to stick to this easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8087)|
| 2:14:49| when they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8089)|
| 2:14:51| when the law has been changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8091)|
| 2:14:53| for them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8093)|
| 2:14:55| Again, I think it would depend on the terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8095)|
| 2:14:57| of the easement itself, so I really couldn't answer that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8097)|
| 2:14:59| question right now without seeing an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8099)|
| 2:15:01| example of at least one of the easements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8101)|
| 2:15:03| Mr. Swanson, question for you, sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8103)|

| 2:15:25| That's true| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8125)|
| 2:15:27| What is the potential ramification?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8127)|
| 2:15:29| Let's get away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8129)|
| 2:15:31| let's, for sake of this argument| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8131)|
| 2:15:33| take off the opting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8133)|

| 2:15:41| if a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8141)|

| 2:15:47| that has been in effect which the state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8147)|

| 2:16:01| where that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8161)|
| 2:16:03| has removed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8163)|
| 2:16:05| what is allowed under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8165)|
| 2:16:07| state law to remain in effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8167)|
| 2:16:09| Ordinances that were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8169)|
| 2:16:11| enacted prior to April the 8th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8171)|
| 2:16:13| of 1986 are grandfathered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8173)|
| 2:16:15| under the current law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8175)|
| 2:16:17| If you take an ordinance that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8177)|
| 2:16:19| grandfathered under the current law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8179)|
| 2:16:21| and amend that ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8181)|
| 2:16:23| then it's no longer the ordinance that is grandfathered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8183)|
| 2:16:25| it is a new ordinance once you amend it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8185)|
| 2:16:27| and therefore it would no longer be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8187)|
| 2:16:29| grandfathered under that law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8189)|
| 2:16:31| So if that's changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8191)|
| 2:16:33| then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8193)|
| 2:16:35| then you get to the situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8195)|
| 2:16:37| where you're allowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8197)|
| 2:16:41| guns in parks as it's commonly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8201)|
| 2:16:43| referred to or if you opt out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8203)|
| 2:16:45| you criminalize it, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8205)|
| 2:16:49| Two really different questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8209)|
| 2:16:51| First question is if you amend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8211)|
| 2:16:53| 2060 as it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8213)|
| 2:16:55| presently exists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8215)|
| 2:16:57| then it would no longer be grandfathered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8217)|
| 2:16:59| in under the statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8219)|
| 2:17:01| that authorizes the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8221)|
| 2:17:03| grandfathering of ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8223)|
| 2:17:05| that were passed before April the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8225)|
| 2:17:07| 8th of 1986| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8227)|
| 2:17:09| That's the answer to that question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8229)|
| 2:17:11| The second question was with regard to whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8231)|
| 2:17:13| it's criminal or civil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8233)|
| 2:17:15| A violation of a city ordinance is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8235)|
| 2:17:17| civil offense according to our Supreme Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8237)|
| 2:17:19| They've ruled this several times now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8239)|
| 2:17:21| that city ordinance violations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8241)|
| 2:17:23| are civil matters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8243)|
| 2:17:25| rather than criminal matters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8245)|
| 2:17:27| under the opt-out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8247)|
| 2:17:29| statute or under the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8249)|
| 2:17:31| previous statute or the opt-out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8251)|
| 2:17:33| statute. It is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8253)|
| 2:17:35| class A misdemeanor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8255)|

| 2:17:41| either of those statutes and the class A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8261)|
| 2:17:43| misdemeanor is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8263)|
| 2:17:45| under the criminal law rather than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8265)|
| 2:17:47| under the civil law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8267)|
| 2:17:49| Let me ask this question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8269)|
| 2:17:53| Someone can please correct me if I'm wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8273)|
| 2:17:55| Guns on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8275)|
| 2:17:57| the premises of a school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8277)|
| 2:17:59| are not allowed and not affected by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8279)|
| 2:18:01| this recent state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8281)|
| 2:18:03| Correct? There's an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8283)|
| 2:18:05| Attorney General's opinion that said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8285)|
| 2:18:07| that to the extent that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8287)|
| 2:18:09| schools utilize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8289)|
| 2:18:11| parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8291)|
| 2:18:13| in the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8293)|
| 2:18:15| program, whether that's for athletics or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8295)|
| 2:18:17| that may be for which schools use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8297)|
| 2:18:19| parks, the statute that prohibits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8299)|
| 2:18:21| guns being carried| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8301)|
| 2:18:23| on the grounds of schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8303)|
| 2:18:25| comes into effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8305)|
| 2:18:27| and so guns would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8307)|
| 2:18:29| prohibited to the extent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8309)|
| 2:18:31| that parks were being utilized for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8311)|
| 2:18:33| school purposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8313)|
| 2:18:35| The question is what about schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8315)|
| 2:18:37| Just school property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8317)|
| 2:18:41| There's been a statute in effect for some time that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8321)|
| 2:18:43| prohibits guns on schools and I don't think any of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8323)|
| 2:18:45| any of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8325)|
| 2:18:47| that we're talking about in any way impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8327)|
| 2:18:49| that one way or the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8329)|
| 2:18:51| So what happens if you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8331)|
| 2:18:53| the greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8333)|
| 2:18:55| that crosses the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8335)|
| 2:18:57| of Northwest Middle School, for example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8337)|
| 2:18:59| that extends from Victor Ash Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8339)|
| 2:19:01| or the greenway that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8341)|
| 2:19:03| runs, I think, near| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8343)|
| 2:19:05| Bearden Middle School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8345)|
| 2:19:07| Bearden Elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8347)|
| 2:19:09| Getting into the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8349)|
| 2:19:11| of a law school exam now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8351)|
| 2:19:15| I'm doing the best I can here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8355)|
| 2:19:17| but if it is utilized by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8357)|
| 2:19:19| the schools as a part of the school property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8359)|
| 2:19:21| the statute that prohibits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8361)|
| 2:19:23| carrying guns on that property, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8363)|
| 2:19:25| would be in effect. If it is separate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8365)|
| 2:19:27| and apart from the school property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8367)|
| 2:19:29| and not being utilized for school purposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8369)|
| 2:19:31| then I think that it would not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8371)|
| 2:19:33| be covered under the statute that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8373)|
| 2:19:35| bans guns on schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8375)|
| 2:19:39| Then you would have to determine whether you've got an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8379)|
| 2:19:41| opt-out resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8381)|
| 2:19:43| that applies to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8383)|
| 2:19:45| or whether Section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8385)|
| 2:19:47| 2060 would apply to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8387)|
| 2:19:49| I guess my general concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8389)|
| 2:19:51| is, let's just say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8391)|
| 2:19:53| you try to compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8393)|
| 2:19:55| and you want to allow them in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8395)|
| 2:19:57| greenways but not parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8397)|
| 2:19:59| or parks but not greenways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8399)|
| 2:20:01| I've read the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8401)|

| 2:20:07| then it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8407)|
| 2:20:09| instantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8409)|

| 2:21:25| or all of the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8485)|
| 2:21:27| simply for enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8487)|
| 2:21:29| and simply for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8489)|
| 2:21:31| law-abiding citizens who want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8491)|
| 2:21:33| abide by the law to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8493)|
| 2:21:35| what it is and they don't have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8495)|
| 2:21:37| plan a route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8497)|
| 2:21:39| knowing that it's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8499)|
| 2:21:41| be broken up at some point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8501)|
| 2:21:43| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8503)|
| 2:21:45| Ms. Rowdy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8505)|
| 2:21:47| Thank you. Councilman Frost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8507)|
| 2:21:49| touched on the area that I wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8509)|
| 2:21:51| explore and that's the issue of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8511)|
| 2:21:53| consistency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8513)|
| 2:21:55| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8515)|
| 2:21:57| if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8517)|
| 2:21:59| if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8519)|
| 2:22:01| go with Councilman Hall's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8521)|
| 2:22:03| resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8523)|
| 2:22:05| and we allow guns in parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8525)|
| 2:22:07| we still have this issue with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8527)|
| 2:22:09| schools and I asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8529)|
| 2:22:11| Director Walsh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8531)|
| 2:22:13| at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8533)|
| 2:22:15| Knoxville Parks and Recreation to prepare this list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8535)|
| 2:22:17| that you have in front of us tonight and the middle column| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8537)|
| 2:22:19| shows all the parks that are used by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8539)|
| 2:22:21| Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8541)|
| 2:22:23| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8543)|
| 2:22:25| it's an immediate problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8545)|
| 2:22:27| anytime a school shows up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8547)|
| 2:22:29| we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8549)|
| 2:22:31| back in that situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8551)|
| 2:22:33| where guns aren't allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8553)|
| 2:22:35| so I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8555)|
| 2:22:37| the issue of consistency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8557)|
| 2:22:39| and the enforcement issues are really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8559)|
| 2:22:41| critical. I was the one that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8561)|
| 2:22:43| asked for the workshop and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8563)|
| 2:22:45| brought up the idea of a compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8565)|
| 2:22:47| I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8567)|
| 2:22:49| how much of that we want to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8569)|
| 2:22:51| about tonight. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8571)|
| 2:22:53| I do worry about consistency as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8573)|
| 2:22:55| Councilman Frost said. We have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8575)|
| 2:22:57| certain parks and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8577)|
| 2:22:59| unfortunately we don't have a list of those tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8579)|
| 2:23:01| we have a list of all the parks that have ball| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8581)|
| 2:23:03| fields and all the parks that have playgrounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8583)|
| 2:23:05| but we don't have the reverse, the parks that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8585)|
| 2:23:07| don't have ball fields or playgrounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8587)|
| 2:23:09| but Crouch Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8589)|
| 2:23:11| comes to mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8591)|
| 2:23:13| James Agee Park comes to mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8593)|
| 2:23:15| over in Fort Sanders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8595)|
| 2:23:17| Talahi Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8597)|
| 2:23:19| comes to mind. There's not a ball field or a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8599)|
| 2:23:21| playground in any of those spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8601)|
| 2:23:23| and there is some inconsistency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8603)|
| 2:23:25| I think if you're walking down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8605)|
| 2:23:27| Gay Street and you can lawfully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8607)|
| 2:23:29| carry your weapon and you want to cut over to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8609)|
| 2:23:31| Market Street but if you cut through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8611)|
| 2:23:33| Crouch Park then you're in violation if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8613)|
| 2:23:35| you don't allow guns in parks. Likewise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8615)|
| 2:23:37| Talahi Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8617)|
| 2:23:39| has two sides that go on either side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8619)|
| 2:23:41| of Talahi Park and so if you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8621)|
| 2:23:43| walking down one side of the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8623)|
| 2:23:45| and you decide to cross over and go through Talahi Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8625)|
| 2:23:47| you can't do that if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8627)|
| 2:23:49| are a carry permit holder and have your weapon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8629)|
| 2:23:51| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8631)|
| 2:23:53| in those cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8633)|
| 2:23:55| where there are not children present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8635)|
| 2:23:57| it seems like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8637)|
| 2:23:59| maybe it's inconsistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8639)|
| 2:24:01| Mr. Swanson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8641)|
| 2:24:03| you talked earlier about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8643)|
| 2:24:05| sort of tinkering with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8645)|
| 2:24:07| our law that predated 1986| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8647)|
| 2:24:09| I assume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8649)|
| 2:24:11| this is sort of like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8651)|
| 2:24:13| thinking in the double negative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8653)|
| 2:24:15| if we would amend it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8655)|
| 2:24:17| such that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8657)|
| 2:24:19| carry permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8659)|
| 2:24:21| holders were allowed to carry their guns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8661)|
| 2:24:23| only in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8663)|
| 2:24:25| certain parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8665)|
| 2:24:27| such as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8667)|
| 2:24:29| say Crouch Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8669)|
| 2:24:31| where does that leave us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8671)|
| 2:24:33| with the rest of the state ball of wax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8673)|
| 2:24:35| then we have to allow guns in all the parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8675)|
| 2:24:37| no you'll invalidate the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8677)|
| 2:24:39| completely if you amend it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8679)|
| 2:24:41| authorize carrying guns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8681)|
| 2:24:43| at all because it will be a new ordinance at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8683)|
| 2:24:45| it will not be grandfathered in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8685)|
| 2:24:47| at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8687)|
| 2:24:49| assuming that you wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8689)|
| 2:24:51| to give some consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8691)|
| 2:24:53| to not having guns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8693)|
| 2:24:55| in parks or in some parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8695)|
| 2:24:57| you would have to resort then not to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8697)|
| 2:24:59| not to 2060| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8699)|
| 2:25:01| you would have to resort to the opt out resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8701)|
| 2:25:03| that's authorized in the state statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8703)|
| 2:25:05| under the opt out resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8705)|
| 2:25:07| that's provided for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8707)|
| 2:25:09| in the state statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8709)|
| 2:25:11| you could opt out of some parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8711)|
| 2:25:13| but not all parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8713)|
| 2:25:15| you could identify the parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8715)|
| 2:25:17| I don't think you can opt out of portions of parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8717)|
| 2:25:19| but not the full park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8719)|
| 2:25:21| we have talked about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8721)|
| 2:25:23| in the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8723)|
| 2:25:25| and tried to figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8725)|
| 2:25:27| what exactly can be done and can't be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8727)|
| 2:25:29| and I think your options are going to be limited to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8729)|
| 2:25:31| you either leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8731)|
| 2:25:33| 2060 in place as is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8733)|
| 2:25:35| with no amendment at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8735)|
| 2:25:37| or you go to the opt out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8737)|
| 2:25:39| resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8739)|
| 2:25:41| obviously another option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8741)|
| 2:25:43| is to repeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8743)|
| 2:25:45| 2060 and don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8745)|
| 2:25:47| go to the opt out resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8747)|
| 2:25:49| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8749)|
| 2:25:51| another option would be to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8751)|
| 2:25:53| in any way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8753)|
| 2:25:55| if you amend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8755)|
| 2:25:57| 2060 then it's no longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8757)|
| 2:25:59| grandfathered in and your only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8759)|
| 2:26:01| option is to go to the opt out resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8761)|
| 2:26:03| and identify the parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8763)|
| 2:26:05| in particular that you are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8765)|
| 2:26:07| opting out with respect to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8767)|
| 2:26:09| you can either opt out of all of the parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8769)|
| 2:26:11| or you can opt out of certain named| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8771)|
| 2:26:13| parks but it will have to be the whole park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8773)|
| 2:26:15| and not you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8775)|
| 2:26:17| this portion of the park but not that portion of the park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8777)|
| 2:26:19| you can't do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8779)|
| 2:26:21| just to make sure I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8781)|
| 2:26:23| good luck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8783)|
| 2:26:25| we can stick with the status quo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8785)|
| 2:26:27| which has been no guns in any of our parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8787)|
| 2:26:29| is that right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8789)|
| 2:26:31| we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8791)|
| 2:26:33| opt out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8793)|
| 2:26:35| no we don't need to opt out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8795)|
| 2:26:37| we can stick with the status quo which is no guns in any of our parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8797)|
| 2:26:39| we could amend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8799)|
| 2:26:41| the ordinance per councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8801)|
| 2:26:43| Hall's resolution and that would allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8803)|
| 2:26:45| guns in all our parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8805)|
| 2:26:47| so those are the two extremes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8807)|
| 2:26:49| the middle ground would be to go with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8809)|
| 2:26:51| the opt out provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8811)|
| 2:26:53| that the state has provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8813)|
| 2:26:55| but to only opt out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8815)|
| 2:26:57| certain parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8817)|
| 2:26:59| say opt out of all the ball fields and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8819)|
| 2:27:01| playgrounds and then those that remained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8821)|
| 2:27:03| unnamed would be where carry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8823)|
| 2:27:05| permit holders could carry their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8825)|
| 2:27:07| weapons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8827)|
| 2:27:09| I like the way you stated it better than the way I stated it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8829)|
| 2:27:11| it was more clear the way you stated it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8831)|
| 2:27:13| there you go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8833)|
| 2:27:15| let me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8835)|
| 2:27:17| call on the vice mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8837)|
| 2:27:19| if nobody else has anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8839)|
| 2:27:21| quick question for Mr. Swanson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8841)|
| 2:27:23| can you say again about the criminalization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8843)|
| 2:27:25| of it in regards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8845)|
| 2:27:27| to what Ms. Roddy just explained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8847)|
| 2:27:29| and how that changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8849)|
| 2:27:31| I'll try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8851)|
| 2:27:33| I think what you're asking is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8853)|
| 2:27:35| if you leave 2060| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8855)|
| 2:27:37| our current ordinance 2060 intact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8857)|
| 2:27:39| and that is your basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8859)|
| 2:27:41| for not allowing guns in parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8861)|
| 2:27:43| then a violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8863)|
| 2:27:45| of that ordinance would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8865)|
| 2:27:47| a civil violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8867)|
| 2:27:49| the maximum penalty for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8869)|
| 2:27:51| would be a $50 fine in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8871)|
| 2:27:53| city court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8873)|
| 2:27:55| if you were to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8875)|
| 2:27:57| away from that and go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8877)|
| 2:27:59| the opt out resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8879)|
| 2:28:01| and someone was to violate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8881)|
| 2:28:03| the opt out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8883)|
| 2:28:05| you had an opt out resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8885)|
| 2:28:07| they opted out all the parks or some portion of the parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8887)|
| 2:28:09| and somebody violated that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8889)|
| 2:28:11| then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8891)|
| 2:28:13| it would be a class A misdemeanor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8893)|
| 2:28:15| it would not be tried in the city court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8895)|
| 2:28:17| it would be tried in the general sessions court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8897)|
| 2:28:19| the maximum penalty would be 11 months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8899)|
| 2:28:21| 29 days in jail and some amount of fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8901)|
| 2:28:23| that I can't recall right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8903)|
| 2:28:25| thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8905)|
| 2:28:27| I'm going to go ahead and just state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8907)|
| 2:28:29| I'm still listening on this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8909)|
| 2:28:31| I especially want to find out a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8911)|
| 2:28:33| on some of the training for getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8913)|
| 2:28:35| a carry permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8915)|
| 2:28:37| the information that Captain Catlett handed out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8917)|
| 2:28:39| is eye opening to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8919)|
| 2:28:41| I look at this and if I take all of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8921)|
| 2:28:43| violent crimes I see in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8923)|
| 2:28:45| for 5 years at 143| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8925)|
| 2:28:47| parks and this is everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8927)|
| 2:28:49| up from simple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8929)|
| 2:28:51| assault which is sort of punching somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8931)|
| 2:28:53| I see 51 crimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8933)|
| 2:28:55| in 5 years at 143 parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8935)|
| 2:28:57| almost half of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8937)|
| 2:28:59| are simple assaults| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8939)|
| 2:29:01| I just feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8941)|
| 2:29:03| this feels like a solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8943)|
| 2:29:05| in search of a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8945)|
| 2:29:07| I see things happening in parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8947)|
| 2:29:09| I see incredibly safe parks here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8949)|
| 2:29:11| and I see a system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8951)|
| 2:29:13| that's worked for 50 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8953)|
| 2:29:15| and I don't understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8955)|
| 2:29:17| what the need is to change it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8957)|
| 2:29:19| again I'm open to it but I have some issues with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8959)|
| 2:29:21| so having said that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8961)|
| 2:29:23| Mr. Hall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8963)|
| 2:29:25| I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8965)|
| 2:29:27| one of the issues that I personally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8967)|
| 2:29:29| have with it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8969)|
| 2:29:31| today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8971)|
| 2:29:33| most of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8973)|
| 2:29:35| law abiding citizens with carry permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8975)|
| 2:29:37| are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8977)|
| 2:29:39| what they're going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8979)|
| 2:29:41| they're going to leave their gun in the car| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8981)|
| 2:29:43| at one of these parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8983)|
| 2:29:45| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8985)|
| 2:29:47| if you'll look at that list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8987)|
| 2:29:49| the number one thing that was happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8989)|
| 2:29:51| at these parks were automobile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8991)|
| 2:29:53| break-ins and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8993)|
| 2:29:55| at that point you're taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8995)|
| 2:29:57| a legally owned firearm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8997)|
| 2:29:59| and making it an illegal firearm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=8999)|
| 2:30:01| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9001)|
| 2:30:03| so I think that in itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9003)|
| 2:30:05| is something that I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9005)|
| 2:30:07| a lot of problems with and I've had problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9007)|
| 2:30:09| with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9009)|
| 2:30:11| state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9011)|
| 2:30:13| which they are correcting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9013)|
| 2:30:15| over the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9015)|
| 2:30:17| they have closed a lot of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9017)|
| 2:30:19| what I call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9019)|
| 2:30:21| loopholes where it would force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9021)|
| 2:30:23| the carry permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9023)|
| 2:30:25| holders to leave their guns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9025)|
| 2:30:27| in cars which I actually think it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9027)|
| 2:30:29| a bad thing and I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9029)|
| 2:30:31| they have realized that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9031)|
| 2:30:33| and are closing those gaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9033)|
| 2:30:35| but I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9035)|
| 2:30:37| just from looking at that list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9037)|
| 2:30:39| that really does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9039)|
| 2:30:41| help the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9041)|
| 2:30:43| Ms. Roddy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9043)|
| 2:30:45| I guess this question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9045)|
| 2:30:47| is for Mr. Mills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9047)|
| 2:30:49| and this has to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9049)|
| 2:30:51| with posting of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9051)|
| 2:30:53| ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9053)|
| 2:30:55| again I'm thinking through the various options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9055)|
| 2:30:57| that might present themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9057)|
| 2:30:59| to us when we come to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9059)|
| 2:31:01| deliberate on a vote for this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9061)|
| 2:31:03| and a few moments ago I kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9063)|
| 2:31:05| spelled out three options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9065)|
| 2:31:07| one is to stick with the status quo where we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9067)|
| 2:31:09| one is some kind of middle ground and then one is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9069)|
| 2:31:11| to amend 2060 per Councilman Hall's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9071)|
| 2:31:13| resolution. Right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9073)|
| 2:31:15| where we are guns are prohibited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9075)|
| 2:31:17| in all of our parks per 2060| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9077)|
| 2:31:19| but my understanding is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9079)|
| 2:31:21| that's not generally posted in our parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9081)|
| 2:31:23| by signage is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9083)|
| 2:31:25| That is my understanding that's probably left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9085)|
| 2:31:27| for someone from Parks and Rec to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9087)|
| 2:31:29| answer definitively but that's my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9089)|
| 2:31:31| understanding. Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9091)|
| 2:31:33| I may need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9093)|
| 2:31:35| Director Anderson on this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9095)|
| 2:31:37| if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9097)|
| 2:31:39| we would go with Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9099)|
| 2:31:41| Hall's resolution to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9101)|
| 2:31:43| amend 2060 and allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9103)|
| 2:31:45| guns in all of our parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9105)|
| 2:31:47| then I guess we wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9107)|
| 2:31:49| need to post that either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9109)|
| 2:31:51| because they're allowed we would only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9111)|
| 2:31:53| post a prohibition is that right Mr. Mills?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9113)|
| 2:31:55| Could you repeat that please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9115)|
| 2:31:57| If we were to go with Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9117)|
| 2:31:59| Hall's resolution and amend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9119)|
| 2:32:01| 2060 and allow guns in all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9121)|
| 2:32:03| our parks but I believe under his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9123)|
| 2:32:05| resolution the rest of the weapon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9125)|
| 2:32:07| prohibition stand bows and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9127)|
| 2:32:09| arrows and billy clubs and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9129)|
| 2:32:11| whatever else is in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9131)|
| 2:32:13| what would be our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9133)|
| 2:32:15| posting option at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9135)|
| 2:32:17| no billy clubs no bows and arrows but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9137)|
| 2:32:19| yes bring your guns I'm trying to envision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9139)|
| 2:32:21| what our parks are going to look like with our signage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9141)|
| 2:32:23| At this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9143)|
| 2:32:25| if 2060 is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9145)|
| 2:32:27| amended or repealed altogether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9147)|
| 2:32:29| then the only thing applicable would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9149)|
| 2:32:31| the state statute and therefore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9151)|
| 2:32:33| under the state statute guns would be allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9153)|
| 2:32:35| in parks because the city has not yet opted out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9155)|
| 2:32:37| therefore the posting requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9157)|
| 2:32:39| would be nil in terms of putting up new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9159)|
| 2:32:41| signs it would only be a matter of removing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9161)|
| 2:32:43| any signs out there now that say no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9163)|
| 2:32:45| that reflect there would be no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9165)|
| 2:32:47| firearms allowed in parks. Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9167)|
| 2:32:49| so then to the middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9169)|
| 2:32:51| option if we opt out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9171)|
| 2:32:53| but only opt out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9173)|
| 2:32:55| certain listed parks in other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9175)|
| 2:32:57| words parks say with ball fields and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9177)|
| 2:32:59| playgrounds for sake of argument| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9179)|
| 2:33:01| then we have some that are in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9181)|
| 2:33:03| and some that are out. Under that scenario| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9183)|
| 2:33:05| do you think we would then have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9185)|
| 2:33:07| posting? There would need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9187)|
| 2:33:09| to be postings for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9189)|
| 2:33:11| parks where guns are prohibited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9191)|
| 2:33:13| and those would be posted at prominent places in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9193)|
| 2:33:15| the park itself. In the parks itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9195)|
| 2:33:17| There would not need to be any postings for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9197)|
| 2:33:19| parks where guns were allowed. Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9199)|
| 2:33:21| And I think Mr. Swanson may have already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9201)|
| 2:33:23| said this at some point earlier but you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9203)|
| 2:33:25| can't split up a park. Right I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9205)|
| 2:33:27| that right so Crouch Park wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9207)|
| 2:33:29| necessarily say bring your guns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9209)|
| 2:33:31| but Victor Ash Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9211)|
| 2:33:33| where there are sporting fields and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9213)|
| 2:33:35| a playground might say no guns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9215)|
| 2:33:37| Under the statute if guns are prohibited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9217)|
| 2:33:39| then that would have to be posted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9219)|
| 2:33:41| if guns are allowed that would not have to be posted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9221)|
| 2:33:43| Mr. Anderson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9223)|
| 2:33:45| are there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9225)|
| 2:33:47| are there postings currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9227)|
| 2:33:49| at any of our parks regarding any types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9229)|
| 2:33:51| of weapons? Yes. Could you tell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9231)|
| 2:33:53| me more at that? We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9233)|
| 2:33:55| posted almost all of our rec centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9235)|
| 2:33:57| that's by state law. Okay. And then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9237)|
| 2:33:59| in a lot of our parks we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9239)|
| 2:34:01| signs that say no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9241)|
| 2:34:03| weapons no a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9243)|
| 2:34:05| things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9245)|
| 2:34:07| it's generally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9247)|
| 2:34:09| on the sign where the park closes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9249)|
| 2:34:11| at the time the park closes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9251)|
| 2:34:13| so we have maybe half of them are posted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9253)|
| 2:34:15| Okay that's one of the concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9255)|
| 2:34:17| that I've heard from citizens and emails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9257)|
| 2:34:19| is their sense is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9259)|
| 2:34:21| we've had this law for a long long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9261)|
| 2:34:23| it's generally accepted and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9263)|
| 2:34:25| the parks aren't currently posted and if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9265)|
| 2:34:27| go around and start posting then it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9267)|
| 2:34:29| going to make citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9269)|
| 2:34:31| families with children feel like all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9271)|
| 2:34:33| of a sudden the parks are dangerous places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9273)|
| 2:34:35| where they didn't feel like it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9275)|
| 2:34:37| dangerous before because there wasn't a sign talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9277)|
| 2:34:39| about it. That's the problem we ran into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9279)|
| 2:34:41| when the law first passed that you had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9281)|
| 2:34:43| to post on recreation center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9283)|
| 2:34:45| doors. It made a significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9285)|
| 2:34:47| difference in people's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9287)|
| 2:34:49| perception of community centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9289)|
| 2:34:51| In a negative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9291)|
| 2:34:53| Yeah it was a negative thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9293)|
| 2:34:55| Now we can but we can administer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9295)|
| 2:34:57| any policy that the council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9297)|
| 2:34:59| passes it just be difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9299)|
| 2:35:01| but we'll manage to administer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9301)|
| 2:35:03| also you need to make sure you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9303)|
| 2:35:05| go beyond just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9305)|
| 2:35:07| if you do compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9307)|
| 2:35:09| that you go beyond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9309)|
| 2:35:11| just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9311)|
| 2:35:13| playgrounds and ball fields because you've got to think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9313)|
| 2:35:15| of zoos, golf courses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9315)|
| 2:35:17| and things like that. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9317)|
| 2:35:19| it's going to take a lot more thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9319)|
| 2:35:21| so over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9321)|
| 2:35:23| the next two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9323)|
| 2:35:25| times that you discuss it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9325)|
| 2:35:27| we probably need to look hard at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9327)|
| 2:35:29| the parks and those kind of things if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9329)|
| 2:35:31| that's something the council is going to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9331)|
| 2:35:33| I guess what I'm trying to get my arms around is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9333)|
| 2:35:35| I have the option of where we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9335)|
| 2:35:37| are now which is no guns in any parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9337)|
| 2:35:39| and it sounds like we're posted in some areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9339)|
| 2:35:41| but not others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9341)|
| 2:35:43| We have the option of guns in all our parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9343)|
| 2:35:45| and there's no signs but then in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9345)|
| 2:35:47| middle ground it sounds like it's going to create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9347)|
| 2:35:49| a lot more signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9349)|
| 2:35:51| A lot more signs in a lot of places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9351)|
| 2:35:53| and the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9353)|
| 2:35:55| thing is where do you enter a park from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9355)|
| 2:35:57| Most of our parks have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9357)|
| 2:35:59| multiple entrances and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9359)|
| 2:36:01| you can enter from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9361)|
| 2:36:03| at least all four sides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9363)|
| 2:36:05| most of the time eight or ten sides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9365)|
| 2:36:07| and we would have to post it several times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9367)|
| 2:36:09| wherever we had a parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9369)|
| 2:36:11| or an access point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9371)|
| 2:36:13| So if the greenways were included in that prohibition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9373)|
| 2:36:15| for example the Third Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9375)|
| 2:36:17| Greenway you might have to post it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9377)|
| 2:36:19| there near West High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9379)|
| 2:36:21| you might need to post it at the entrance off Sutherland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9381)|
| 2:36:23| you'd probably need to post it down at Concord Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9383)|
| 2:36:25| there'd be a whole lot of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9385)|
| 2:36:27| Any crossing street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9387)|
| 2:36:29| any time we cross the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9389)|
| 2:36:31| or any entry point, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9391)|
| 2:36:33| That just helps me understand what we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9393)|
| 2:36:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9395)|
| 2:36:37| Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9397)|
| 2:36:39| Going back to Mr. Hall's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9399)|
| 2:36:41| Councilman Hall's statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9401)|
| 2:36:43| about people having to leave their guns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9403)|
| 2:36:45| in cars when they go into parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9405)|
| 2:36:47| question for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9407)|
| 2:36:49| Mr. Swanson or Mr. Mills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9409)|
| 2:36:51| if the parking lot's in the park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9411)|
| 2:36:53| aren't they already in violation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9413)|
| 2:36:57| If the parking lot is part of the park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9417)|
| 2:36:59| I would say that would be true, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9419)|
| 2:37:01| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9421)|
| 2:37:03| they can leave their gun in their car| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9423)|
| 2:37:05| and they're still breaking the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9425)|
| 2:37:07| Mr. Mills, do you think that's possession?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9427)|
| 2:37:11| I think you'd have a hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9431)|
| 2:37:13| case to prove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9433)|
| 2:37:15| in a court in terms of possession| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9435)|
| 2:37:17| if the car is in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9437)|
| 2:37:19| park, in a locked car| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9439)|
| 2:37:21| if the gun's in a locked car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9441)|
| 2:37:23| Okay, so...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9443)|
| 2:37:25| Say that again. The law deals with possession| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9445)|
| 2:37:27| and personal possession. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9447)|
| 2:37:29| I think you'd have a hard case to prove there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9449)|
| 2:37:31| I do need to point out that in the statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9451)|
| 2:37:33| relating to schools, there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9453)|
| 2:37:35| a specific exception for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9455)|
| 2:37:37| guns that are parked or guns that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9457)|
| 2:37:39| locked in parked cars on school grounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9459)|
| 2:37:41| So you do have the legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9461)|
| 2:37:43| making that specific exception for schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9463)|
| 2:37:45| and there's nothing specifically in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9465)|
| 2:37:47| regarding parks. So it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9467)|
| 2:37:49| not an easy call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9469)|
| 2:37:51| I was aware of the school issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9471)|
| 2:37:53| and I didn't realize it was specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9473)|
| 2:37:55| to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9475)|
| 2:37:57| part of the state code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9477)|
| 2:37:59| That has been addressed by the legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9479)|
| 2:38:01| Right. Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9481)|
| 2:38:03| I see Mr. Frost next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9483)|
| 2:38:05| and then Mr. Holland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9485)|
| 2:38:07| I've got a question for Director Anderson, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9487)|
| 2:38:09| He's not off the hook yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9489)|
| 2:38:11| And he's not paying attention either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9491)|
| 2:38:15| I was here for support, not for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9495)|
| 2:38:17| opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9497)|
| 2:38:19| Let me ask you this. World's Fair Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9499)|
| 2:38:21| What organized...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9501)|
| 2:38:23| The City Parks and Rec Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9503)|
| 2:38:25| doesn't organize any recreational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9505)|
| 2:38:27| activities at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9507)|
| 2:38:29| park, do they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9509)|
| 2:38:31| We have indoor track in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9511)|
| 2:38:33| convention center that practices out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9513)|
| 2:38:35| in the park. But generally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9515)|
| 2:38:37| we have a playground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9517)|
| 2:38:39| I'm just talking about the grass out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9519)|
| 2:38:41| World's Fair Park, the grass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9521)|
| 2:38:43| No. Okay. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9523)|
| 2:38:45| surely you've seen pickup games| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9525)|
| 2:38:47| of football,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9527)|
| 2:38:49| baseball,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9529)|
| 2:38:51| frisbee golf, or ultimate out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9531)|
| 2:38:53| right? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9533)|
| 2:38:55| So, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9535)|
| 2:38:57| if you try to allow some areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9537)|
| 2:38:59| to, under a compromise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9539)|
| 2:39:01| say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9541)|
| 2:39:03| gun's welcome zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9543)|
| 2:39:05| what are you going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9545)|
| 2:39:07| when, for sake of argument,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9547)|
| 2:39:09| World's Fair Park is a gun welcome zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9549)|
| 2:39:11| when there is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9551)|
| 2:39:13| pickup game of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9553)|
| 2:39:15| athletics. I'll use my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9555)|
| 2:39:17| 8-year-old as an example. A mean game| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9557)|
| 2:39:19| of four square breaks out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9559)|
| 2:39:21| What are you going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9561)|
| 2:39:23| What's going to be enforced? How is the city going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9563)|
| 2:39:25| handle that? One of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9565)|
| 2:39:27| great things about being Parks and Recreation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9567)|
| 2:39:29| Director is the police have to enforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9569)|
| 2:39:31| the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9571)|
| 2:39:33| All we have to do is put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9573)|
| 2:39:35| up the signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9575)|
| 2:39:37| You would have to ask the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9577)|
| 2:39:39| and the law department. That wouldn't be something that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9579)|
| 2:39:41| would have an opinion on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9581)|
| 2:39:43| Mr. Mills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9583)|
| 2:39:45| I'm not sure I quite understood the premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9585)|
| 2:39:47| Well, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9587)|
| 2:39:49| let's just say you have a compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9589)|
| 2:39:51| and you allow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9591)|
| 2:39:53| you know, you're not supposed to have them around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9593)|
| 2:39:55| playgrounds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9595)|
| 2:39:57| and you're not going to have them around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9597)|
| 2:39:59| athletic events. If you say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9599)|
| 2:40:01| there's a compromise that allows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9601)|
| 2:40:03| weapons in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9603)|
| 2:40:05| Crouch Park, World's Fair Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9605)|
| 2:40:07| and somebody comes out and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9607)|
| 2:40:09| you know, people go out all the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9609)|
| 2:40:11| and play football,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9611)|

| 2:40:15| in World's Fair Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9615)|
| 2:40:17| is this going to cause enforcement issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9617)|
| 2:40:19| I'm not sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9619)|
| 2:40:21| compromise is possible because if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9621)|
| 2:40:23| you're talking about anything that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9623)|
| 2:40:25| would, first off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9625)|
| 2:40:27| you'd have to change the ordinance and the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9627)|
| 2:40:29| would go by the wayside. Second, you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9629)|
| 2:40:31| talking about, if you're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9631)|
| 2:40:33| about applying it only to parks with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9633)|
| 2:40:35| playgrounds, I think that's part of the parceling out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9635)|
| 2:40:37| that the statute would not allow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9637)|
| 2:40:39| So I think it's all or nothing for the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9639)|
| 2:40:41| So whether it has a playground or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9641)|
| 2:40:43| you'd have to designate a specific park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9643)|
| 2:40:45| and you couldn't say just the parks with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9645)|
| 2:40:47| playgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9647)|
| 2:40:53| Mr. Hall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9653)|
| 2:40:55| I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9655)|
| 2:40:57| maybe it's just my own ignorance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9657)|
| 2:40:59| but when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9659)|
| 2:41:01| Mr. Anderson was speaking, he was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9661)|
| 2:41:03| talking about golf courses and zoos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9663)|
| 2:41:05| What is the definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9665)|
| 2:41:07| where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9667)|
| 2:41:09| the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9669)|
| 2:41:11| said that you gave us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9671)|
| 2:41:13| this option of what is a park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9673)|
| 2:41:15| Because I wouldn't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9675)|
| 2:41:17| thought that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9677)|
| 2:41:19| one of the golf courses that the city owned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9679)|
| 2:41:21| was a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9681)|
| 2:41:23| I'd have to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9683)|
| 2:41:25| back and research the state law to see if it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9685)|
| 2:41:27| specifically defined park. Our city code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9687)|
| 2:41:29| does define park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9689)|
| 2:41:31| I'd have to go find it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9691)|
| 2:41:33| But you see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9693)|
| 2:41:35| where I'm getting. I mean, Councilman Frost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9695)|
| 2:41:37| is talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9697)|
| 2:41:39| making all these criminal opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9699)|
| 2:41:41| zones around the town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9701)|
| 2:41:43| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9703)|
| 2:41:45| I'm concerned about what is a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9705)|
| 2:41:49| Sharps Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9709)|
| 2:41:51| Sharps Ridge is a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9711)|
| 2:41:53| And technically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9713)|
| 2:41:55| we could get up there and play touch football| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9715)|
| 2:41:57| in the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9717)|
| 2:41:59| But it doesn't happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9719)|
| 2:42:01| very often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9721)|
| 2:42:03| Ms. Filo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9723)|
| 2:42:09| You know, I usually have so much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9729)|
| 2:42:11| to say about everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9731)|
| 2:42:13| I have to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9733)|
| 2:42:15| you have just about rendered me speechless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9735)|
| 2:42:17| tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9737)|
| 2:42:19| And I will also shock you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9739)|
| 2:42:21| by saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9741)|
| 2:42:23| I think the Vice Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9743)|
| 2:42:25| spoke some words of wisdom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9745)|
| 2:42:27| You know, we are truly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9747)|
| 2:42:29| trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9749)|
| 2:42:31| find a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9751)|
| 2:42:37| It just concerns me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9757)|
| 2:42:39| that we have spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9759)|
| 2:42:41| this much time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9761)|
| 2:42:43| and we have gone to such lengths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9763)|
| 2:42:45| to discuss this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9765)|
| 2:42:47| I have told you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9767)|
| 2:42:49| that initially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9769)|
| 2:42:51| I felt like I knew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9771)|
| 2:42:53| where I was coming down on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9773)|
| 2:42:55| After giving me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9775)|
| 2:42:57| this much time to think about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9777)|
| 2:42:59| I have completely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9779)|
| 2:43:01| moved 360 degrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9781)|
| 2:43:03| Because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9783)|
| 2:43:05| I just feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9785)|
| 2:43:07| that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9787)|
| 2:43:09| we haven't had a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9789)|
| 2:43:11| And I do think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9791)|
| 2:43:13| perception is everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9793)|
| 2:43:15| And I think people have a sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9795)|
| 2:43:17| of what parks are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9797)|
| 2:43:19| and what they expect out of a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9799)|
| 2:43:21| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9801)|
| 2:43:23| I tend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9803)|
| 2:43:25| to agree with the Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9805)|
| 2:43:27| I will be glad to think about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9807)|
| 2:43:29| for two more weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9809)|
| 2:43:31| And I will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9811)|
| 2:43:33| very interested to know what else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9813)|
| 2:43:35| we can learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9815)|
| 2:43:37| And frankly, tonight, I think we have learned a great deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9817)|
| 2:43:39| I think we probably all have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9819)|
| 2:43:41| No matter where we stand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9821)|
| 2:43:43| on the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9823)|
| 2:43:45| We have gotten a lot of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9825)|
| 2:43:47| It is very worthwhile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9827)|
| 2:43:49| But I will have to tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9829)|
| 2:43:51| that this whole discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9831)|
| 2:43:53| is very difficult because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9833)|
| 2:43:55| I really cannot find a great deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9835)|
| 2:43:57| to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9837)|
| 2:44:01| Mr. Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9841)|
| 2:44:03| If somebody does come up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9843)|
| 2:44:05| some sort of a compromise proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9845)|
| 2:44:07| then they will need to think these things out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9847)|
| 2:44:09| and come to us and explain it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9849)|
| 2:44:11| I failed to mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9851)|
| 2:44:13| in my comments that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9853)|
| 2:44:15| I know it would be very difficult to draw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9855)|
| 2:44:17| lines and boundaries and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9857)|
| 2:44:19| some of the things that have been mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9859)|
| 2:44:21| But we could go through hypotheticals all night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9861)|
| 2:44:23| And so until someone comes up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9863)|
| 2:44:25| with some sort of a compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9865)|
| 2:44:27| plan, I think we ought to probably just stick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9867)|
| 2:44:29| to the repeal of the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9869)|
| 2:44:31| and the guns in the parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9871)|
| 2:44:33| Ms. Rowdy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9873)|
| 2:44:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9875)|
| 2:44:37| Mr. Anderson again. There he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9877)|
| 2:44:39| You can actually stay there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9879)|
| 2:44:41| This is just a request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9881)|
| 2:44:43| In the interest of productive discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9883)|
| 2:44:45| and the exploration of all of our options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9885)|
| 2:44:47| when this comes before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9887)|
| 2:44:49| two weeks from Tuesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9889)|
| 2:44:51| could you provide for Council the inverse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9891)|
| 2:44:53| of the list tonight? In other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9893)|
| 2:44:55| those parks in the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9895)|
| 2:44:57| which have neither a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9897)|
| 2:44:59| ball field nor a playground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9899)|
| 2:45:03| I mentioned Crouch Park and Tallahee Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9903)|
| 2:45:05| off the top of my head earlier tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9905)|
| 2:45:07| Parks that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9907)|
| 2:45:09| have neither any kind of ball field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9909)|
| 2:45:11| nor any kind of playground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9911)|
| 2:45:13| Yes. And would you like for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-090903-special?start=9913)|
