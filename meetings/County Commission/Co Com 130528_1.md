| 2:42:26| But I do understand that kind of powerless at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9746)|
| 2:42:29| But that's something that I think we need to get our county legislative group to tackle come next session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9749)|
| 2:42:41| Dr. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9761)|
| 2:42:42| I was going to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9762)|
| 2:42:44| I don't think some of these can even be handled at the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9764)|
| 2:42:46| I thought that the license to have a machine gun was a federal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9766)|
| 2:42:50| That is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9770)|
| 2:42:51| It was a federal license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9771)|
| 2:42:52| And that's not something that can be handled at the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9772)|
| 2:42:56| You can get a license for a machine gun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9776)|
| 2:42:59| But aren't there regulations on when and where you fire it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9779)|
| 2:43:03| Well, no, but I'm talking about here is that, see, the accusations made in here that they,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9783)|
| 2:43:07| I don't know if they've got a .30 caliber machine gun on the back of their pickup truck or what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9787)|
| 2:43:11| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9791)|
| 2:43:12| But you can have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9792)|
| 2:43:14| But it's a federal license that permits you to do that, not a, I don't think it's a state, the state can't permit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9794)|
| 2:43:19| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9799)|
| 2:43:25| Let me just ask a question, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9805)|
| 2:43:28| Because I've heard probably the same complaints that Dave's had and Commissioner Hammond and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9808)|
| 2:43:36| The people can call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9816)|
| 2:43:38| Do we still encourage them or do we just stay out of it to call if they feel in danger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9818)|
| 2:43:44| bullets flying over their head like is in this situation and a bell to haze the backstop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9824)|
| 2:43:50| still call the sheriff's office and someone comes out and then it's, he sort of says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9830)|
| 2:43:55| well, I'm sorry, but nothing we can do about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9835)|
| 2:43:59| You're at your own peril.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9839)|
| 2:44:01| I mean, it's a tough situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9841)|
| 2:44:03| I understand the Second Amendment, but, I mean, I would, I really greatly worry for some people's safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9843)|
| 2:44:10| And I think to just say, no thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9850)|
| 2:44:15| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9855)|
| 2:44:16| Give your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9856)|
| 2:44:17| Randy Renaud, 4407 Walton Pond Lane Court in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9857)|
| 2:44:23| I'm the one that wrote the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9863)|
| 2:44:28| Somebody has got a, I'm an ex, I mean, combat Vietnam veteran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9868)|
| 2:44:37| And I know what a fully automatic weapon sounds like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9877)|
| 2:44:41| And I live in Walker Hill Subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9881)|
| 2:44:44| and somebody's got the idea that they can go up to the rear of the subdivision around the back of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9884)|
| 2:44:51| and shoot this, I don't know what it is, it's some kind of automatic weapon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9891)|
| 2:44:57| Because I've secured enough when I was in Vietnam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9897)|
| 2:45:01| And we got some neighbors in our neighborhood that goes in their backyard and takes a bale of hay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9901)|
| 2:45:08| and shoots in it because I've caught one man and a boy that went in the backyard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9908)|
| 2:45:15| and they had a rifle shooting it through a bale of hay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9915)|
| 2:45:19| The kid could have, you know, could have missed the target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9919)|
| 2:45:23| And the subdivision, the house is just 60 feet apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9923)|
| 2:45:27| I mean, they're right up against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9927)|
| 2:45:29| I mean, they ain't no farther from here to the chairman up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9929)|
| 2:45:34| And what do you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9934)|
| 2:45:36| I mean, I've called the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9936)|
| 2:45:39| They said there ain't no laws that protect me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9939)|
| 2:45:43| I mean, what do I do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9943)|
| 2:45:45| Do I do like some of these gun nuts and get me a rifle and fire back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9945)|
| 2:45:51| I mean, in Vietnam that's what you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9951)|
| 2:45:55| I mean, you protect yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9955)|
| 2:45:57| You bullet for a bullet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9957)|
| 2:46:00| I mean, it's really frustrating for me to live in my subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9960)|
| 2:46:08| And I know that the people that are right back against me is like a little farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9968)|
| 2:46:14| It ain't probably two or three acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9974)|
| 2:46:16| And I've seen them or heard them back there shooting a gun, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9976)|
| 2:46:20| And I've hollered at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9980)|
| 2:46:21| They heard me and they quit firing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9981)|
| 2:46:25| I mean, it's something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9985)|
| 2:46:26| You could have a law against fireworks in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9986)|
| 2:46:30| and you can go in your backyard and shoot a gun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9990)|
| 2:46:36| I mean, it's senseless to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=9996)|
| 2:46:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10001)|
| 2:46:42| Thank you, Mr. Renaud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10002)|
| 2:46:43| Are there other questions or comments on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10003)|
| 2:46:48| Certainly an area of concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10008)|
| 2:46:51| we have to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10011)|
| 2:46:54| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10014)|
| 2:46:55| Next discussion item regarding the four-member education committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10015)|
| 2:46:59| and four-member commission committee joint meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10019)|
| 2:47:04| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10024)|
| 2:47:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10025)|
| 2:47:08| I think there's been two or three meetings of that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10028)|
| 2:47:10| There's been one schedule that was canceled because of notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10030)|
| 2:47:15| There is another one coming up next week, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10035)|
| 2:47:20| Probably next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10040)|
| 2:47:22| Or it is a week from today, one to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10042)|
| 2:47:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10044)|
| 2:47:25| So the issue that has been used in this committee as a training exercise, I guess you could say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10045)|
| 2:47:37| at team building or consensus building has been the issue of whether or not we, Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10057)|
| 2:47:48| should transfer the ownership of all Board of Education used real estate to be titled in their name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10068)|
| 2:48:00| Now, I personally didn't pick that subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10080)|
| 2:48:06| I believe it to be a very thorny issue, and it's probably got you only go in two directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10086)|
| 2:48:13| You stay where we are or you change direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10093)|
| 2:48:17| The issue that I guess is before commission from me right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10097)|
| 2:48:22| and from other members of that committee would be commission's opinion of that particular situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10102)|
| 2:48:32| And let me rephrase it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10112)|
| 2:48:34| It is should we continue to have the real estate of Knox County for all agencies of Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10114)|
| 2:48:42| Should that real estate be maintained and titled in the name of Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10122)|
| 2:48:47| Or should we give away real estate in Knox County to the agency which happens to be operating it for that particular day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10127)|
| 2:48:57| That's my personal question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10137)|
| 2:48:59| That's not a question of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10139)|
| 2:49:01| It's my question as an individual member of that committee to open the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10141)|
| 2:49:09| And then Commissioner Hammond is also a member of that committee, so he may speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10149)|
| 2:49:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10161)|
| 2:49:22| Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10162)|
| 2:49:23| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10163)|
| 2:49:24| I just can't avoid making a comment on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10164)|
| 2:49:28| When we're talking about educating our kids, this really seems like one of these little things that we're wasting a lot of time on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10168)|
| 2:49:35| I mean, I personally think it ought to go ahead and be titled to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10175)|
| 2:49:41| But just to spend a lot of time on this when it has nothing at all to do with educating kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10181)|
| 2:49:46| it has nothing at all to do with us funding the needs of the schools, what the needs of the schools are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10186)|
| 2:49:52| And, you know, I think if it's deteriorated to that point, you know, Lord help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10192)|
| 2:50:00| I mean, this is just such a minor issue that deals with the education of the kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10200)|
| 2:50:05| I mean, that's what I think that committee ought to be dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10205)|
| 2:50:09| And I think it's just really gotten petty if it's gotten down to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10209)|
| 2:50:13| I'm not criticizing you folks because I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10213)|
| 2:50:17| I'll second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10217)|
| 2:50:18| But I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10218)|
| 2:50:19| I just think we ought to really be concentrating on what we're supposed to be concentrating on, is what do we need to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10219)|
| 2:50:24| What resources does the school need to educate the kids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10224)|
| 2:50:27| How are we going to give them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10227)|
| 2:50:28| Finding the balance between what we can afford and what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10228)|
| 2:50:31| Where is the money best spent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10231)|
| 2:50:33| I mean, those are the kind of things that, you know, that we ought to be talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10233)|
| 2:50:36| It ought to be the school board presenting to the county commission or the county commission's representatives about what, you know, why they need money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10236)|
| 2:50:45| And then the county commissioners need to be asking, is this the best way to spend the money because we have limited resources?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10245)|
| 2:50:51| Is this the best way to get the biggest bang for our buck?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10251)|
| 2:50:53| That's the kind of things that we need to be talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10253)|
| 2:50:57| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10257)|
| 2:50:58| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10258)|
| 2:50:59| One correction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10259)|
| 2:51:00| That meeting's on June 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10260)|
| 2:51:03| I think you said the 5th, but it's on June 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10263)|
| 2:51:06| But, you know, to Commissioner Briggs' point, it sounds piddly, but it's millions of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10266)|
| 2:51:12| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10272)|
| 2:51:13| So whenever you're talking about potential millions of dollars, it does affect both entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10273)|
| 2:51:18| You know, and with property comes property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10278)|
| 2:51:23| I mean, you know, so then if you get into this, okay, we own the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10283)|
| 2:51:27| We know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10287)|
| 2:51:28| Come on, let's be real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10288)|
| 2:51:29| We will tend to want to hold the reins fairly tight on that property, whereas if it's their property, they may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10289)|
| 2:51:35| And I'm not saying which one is right or wrong, but it does, it is a thorny issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10295)|
| 2:51:42| We have a tendency to reach and sometimes overreach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10302)|
| 2:51:46| That's history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10306)|
| 2:51:47| That's a historical statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10307)|
| 2:51:49| So if a school doesn't own a property but, I don't know, they want to create an entrepreneurial center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10309)|
| 2:51:54| and build a franchise or something there, is that something we're going to want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10314)|
| 2:51:57| No, we're going to want to get involved in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10317)|
| 2:51:59| And maybe we should, maybe we shouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10319)|
| 2:52:01| Again, but I think just to say, oh, we're talking about property, so that's piddly and that's not educating kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10321)|
| 2:52:08| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10328)|
| 2:52:09| It takes a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10329)|
| 2:52:10| We educate our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10330)|
| 2:52:11| And the facilities and the properties are a huge, huge part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10331)|
| 2:52:15| And so I think these are the issues where our roles interact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10335)|
| 2:52:21| You know, so I think we should be talking about things like property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10341)|
| 2:52:24| We don't deal with what textbook to use and whether you want an iPad or a Google Chrome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10344)|
| 2:52:30| That's not what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10350)|
| 2:52:32| That's not where we deal with the education school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10352)|
| 2:52:36| But property, finances, those are things that we tend to deal with them with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10356)|
| 2:52:43| And so, you know, I think this is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10363)|
| 2:52:45| It came up as an issue dealing with Beard and Middle, that property associated with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10365)|
| 2:52:50| So it was a pretty big contentious issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10370)|
| 2:52:52| So what we said we would do was pass these things on to this joint committee to hash out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10372)|
| 2:52:57| So I don't want to make light, I don't want us to make light of us talking about property issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10377)|
| 2:53:05| It's a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10385)|
| 2:53:06| It's millions and millions and millions of dollars across this county that we own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10386)|
| 2:53:11| And so I think it's totally appropriate for this to be an issue before that joint committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10391)|
| 2:53:18| Maybe not the first one, but, you know, this is the first thing that came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10398)|
| 2:53:22| This is the first thorny issue that we had to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10402)|
| 2:53:25| So that's how it landed at the number one position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10405)|
| 2:53:28| I don't think there was any ulterior motive or anything to get it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10408)|
| 2:53:33| But, you know, let's go into this committee, joint committee, with an open mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10413)|
| 2:53:40| It's not a decision-making body, not going to decide anything, not going to cast a vote for this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10420)|
| 2:53:45| All we're going to do is talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10425)|
| 2:53:47| Can we come to a consensus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10427)|
| 2:53:49| Can a crosscut of this body and that body come to a consensus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10429)|
| 2:53:53| If we can't, ain't no way in heck it's going to come back to the full body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10433)|
| 2:53:57| You know, if nothing else, it will be something that we use to vet and hash things out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10437)|
| 2:54:03| and probably save some time with this body and save some time with the school board as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10443)|
| 2:54:08| So, again, let's not throw a bunch of quotes out there that's just going to end up churning through these quotes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10448)|
| 2:54:16| We met once or twice, twice I guess, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10456)|
| 2:54:19| So let's give the committee some time to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10459)|
| 2:54:24| And if it's not a fruitful process, trust me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10464)|
| 2:54:27| I don't think anyone is going to want to just continue to draw on when there's not much success with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10467)|
| 2:54:34| But let's give it a good shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10474)|
| 2:54:37| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10477)|
| 2:54:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10479)|
| 2:54:42| I don't really understand why that is such a big issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10482)|
| 2:54:48| because I don't see any advantage to them owning a piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10488)|
| 2:54:53| or if the county owns a piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10493)|
| 2:54:55| Whatever, it still remains a county asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10495)|
| 2:55:00| The school system is not a separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10500)|
| 2:55:05| It's an arm of the Knox County total government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10505)|
| 2:55:10| although I realize they're going to come say, you can't tell us how it's finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10510)|
| 2:55:14| We've heard that time and time again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10514)|
| 2:55:15| But the fact is, Chris, if we go to you talked earlier about our bond ratings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10515)|
| 2:55:26| and part of that based on assets that we own, such as properties, is that not taken into consideration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10526)|
| 2:55:41| President, we've got ten school buildings out here worth $100 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10541)|
| 2:55:47| Is that not an asset to Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10547)|
| 2:55:51| In the financial statements of Knox County, those assets appear on the school's balance sheet as an asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10551)|
| 2:55:59| But they are still part of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10559)|
| 2:56:03| Yes, they're still part, but they are reported separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10563)|
| 2:56:06| I know they're separate, but still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10566)|
| 2:56:09| What is the advantage of them having it on their side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10569)|
| 2:56:13| I mean, are they going to take care of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10573)|
| 2:56:14| He just answered the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10574)|
| 2:56:16| Are they any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10576)|
| 2:56:19| When did he answer it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10579)|
| 2:56:21| Are they going to take care of the buildings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10581)|
| 2:56:23| The schools take credit for that, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10583)|
| 2:56:27| From a GFOA standard, any asset, whether it's titled to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10587)|
| 2:56:36| or Knox County Schools, as it relates to school activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10596)|
| 2:56:43| that asset appears on the school's balance sheet as an asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10603)|
| 2:56:49| That is strictly from a financial reporting standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10609)|
| 2:56:53| So they get the asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10613)|
| 2:56:55| We get the debt, the liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10615)|
| 2:56:59| Strange as it sounds, but that's how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10619)|
| 2:57:02| That's strictly a financial accounting reporting mechanism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10622)|
| 2:57:08| So the bottom line is it don't matter a hill of beans who owns the deed to that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10628)|
| 2:57:13| whether it's the schools or whether it's the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10633)|
| 2:57:17| I mean, it doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10637)|
| 2:57:19| Does it make them any better bargainers down the line somewhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10639)|
| 2:57:23| Do they take care of the buildings better because they own them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10643)|
| 2:57:27| What's their big advantage other than, say, we own it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10647)|
| 2:57:32| The only thing that I would speak to is just from a financial accounting reporting standard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10652)|
| 2:57:39| and it would have no change to us from a financial, from a reporting standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10659)|
| 2:57:46| if you deeded all the land from the schools to the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10666)|
| 2:57:51| excuse me, from the county to the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10671)|
| 2:57:54| from a reporting standpoint, there's no change to us because it's already reported that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10674)|
| 2:58:00| Now, I know there's other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10680)|
| 2:58:02| I'm just speaking strictly from an accounting reporting standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10682)|
| 2:58:06| What would be the advantage to them if we did it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10686)|
| 2:58:11| Can you think of one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10691)|
| 2:58:14| Not from a reporting standpoint, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10694)|
| 2:58:18| A bargaining standpoint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10698)|
| 2:58:20| A negotiating standpoint somewhere out there with whoever, whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10700)|
| 2:58:25| You know, it's a big witch hunt, bottom line, big witch hunt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10705)|
| 2:58:37| And as Dr. Briggs said earlier, we need to be putting this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10717)|
| 2:58:40| and effort into putting a better education and better materials in the classrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10720)|
| 2:58:45| rather than arguing over whose ball it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10725)|
| 2:58:49| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10729)|
| 2:58:51| Mr. Chairman, let me kind of give you an idea of the meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10731)|
| 2:58:56| and how these meetings are working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10736)|
| 2:58:57| We have a facilitator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10737)|
| 2:58:59| The reason we have a facilitator is we did not think that four commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10739)|
| 2:59:02| and four school board members could get together and accomplish anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10742)|
| 2:59:05| because we would get into the type of conversations that we're having now is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10745)|
| 2:59:09| why do you want, you know, so we don't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10749)|
| 2:59:12| So, Mr. Joyner, the person who led our discussions before, Cornerstone Foundation is financing him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10752)|
| 2:59:19| Taxpayers are not paying for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10759)|
| 2:59:20| It's a private thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10760)|
| 2:59:21| But he's coming in and he has no dog in the hunt or fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10761)|
| 2:59:24| He's just there to help facilitate the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10764)|
| 2:59:27| The notion of the property was just one of several things that were brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10767)|
| 2:59:31| And it was brought up, you know, by the school saying, hey, we know that this is on your agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10771)|
| 2:59:36| This is one of the issues that we can talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10776)|
| 2:59:38| and see if we can come to some type of resolution to present to both bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10778)|
| 2:59:42| So we're not deciding anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10782)|
| 2:59:44| We're bringing recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10784)|
| 2:59:46| But the main issue that we've talked about, and that was just a small item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10786)|
| 2:59:51| the main issue that we've talked about is how can these two bodies get along?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10791)|
| 2:59:56| How can we better communicate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10796)|
| 2:59:58| How can we reduce the tension that results between the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10798)|
| 3:00:02| because we are the funding body, we hold the purse strings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10802)|
| 3:00:05| and they are the people who spend the money, and they're asking for monies and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10805)|
| 3:00:09| So that is our number one priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10809)|
| 3:00:11| That is our number one agenda item is how can we, if we can, talk with one another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10811)|
| 3:00:18| communicate with one another, and try to resolve some of these issues without it becoming so contentious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10818)|
| 3:00:25| and getting blown up in headlines in the newspaper, which doesn't really get anybody anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10825)|
| 3:00:31| It just creates even more issues and tensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10831)|
| 3:00:33| So I just want to let you know that those are kind of the make-ups of the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10833)|
| 3:00:37| But the property thing, not the number one agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10837)|
| 3:00:41| It is on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10841)|
| 3:00:42| The number one agenda item is how can we brainstorm on how we can get along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10842)|
| 3:00:47| and better communicate with one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10847)|
| 3:00:49| And hopefully we can make some progress toward that and report back to you in a few months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10849)|
| 3:00:53| because I think it's going to take a few months, on a plan on how we might be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10853)|
| 3:00:58| And thank you for that, Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10858)|
| 3:01:00| And, of course, Ms. Broils is very disappointed in me, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10860)|
| 3:01:05| just in my leadership on this issue and holds me responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10865)|
| 3:01:10| and has pointed me out several times that I should be making more of an effort towards meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10870)|
| 3:01:22| that address that issue of communication and relationships and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10882)|
| 3:01:28| And I really wanted the committee to run the issue through the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10888)|
| 3:01:35| and get information from the committee and recommendations from the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10895)|
| 3:01:40| I think that's a better way to address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10900)|
| 3:01:43| So that's how I want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10903)|
| 3:01:45| I'm certainly open to, of course, all of you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10905)|
| 3:01:50| I just haven't heard anything else as to, well, we need to take a retreat again and go and have a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10910)|
| 3:01:59| I don't know what we'd have a meeting about, I mean, other than this relationship thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10919)|
| 3:02:04| That's got to be the first thing to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10924)|
| 3:02:08| So we'll see how that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10928)|
| 3:02:11| And that was my take on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10931)|
| 3:02:17| Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10937)|
| 3:02:19| You want to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10939)|
| 3:02:20| You want to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10940)|
| 3:02:22| We did reach out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10942)|
| 3:02:24| And I think most of us from this group that went to that retreat felt like we'd made some progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10944)|
| 3:02:33| And then we get slapped upside the head with a $35 million request and bitched at because we didn't approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10953)|
| 3:02:40| So every time we've reached out, they've socked us back in the nose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10960)|
| 3:02:46| You know, you don't bite the hand that feeds you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10966)|
| 3:02:50| And that's what I see happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10970)|
| 3:02:53| Mr. Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10973)|
| 3:02:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10974)|
| 3:02:58| We had before us, I think, the title of four pieces of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10978)|
| 3:03:04| We put that off for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10984)|
| 3:03:06| Where are we on those four pieces of property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10986)|
| 3:03:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10989)|
| 3:03:11| Until such time as maybe I can get a little bit clearer picture from commission about the ownership of property by agencies of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=10991)|
| 3:03:22| the library, health department, board of education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11002)|
| 3:03:25| then I'll try to refrain from discussing it at any great depth with this other committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11005)|
| 3:03:40| because I do need to know their part of the story, their side of the story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11020)|
| 3:03:47| It's not whether or not it's advantageous for them to own the property or for the citizens of Knox County to own the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11027)|
| 3:03:58| There are four or five loops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11038)|
| 3:04:03| There are four or five hoops we have to jump through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11043)|
| 3:04:06| They can own all the property, and then the property needs to be used for something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11046)|
| 3:04:11| But they're in control of it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11051)|
| 3:04:14| How does it come back if we need to remove Oakwood School from whosoever's ownership of it may have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11054)|
| 3:04:25| and who foots the bill for its remediation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11065)|
| 3:04:28| All of that ultimately is a dollar that is taxed and appropriated by commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11068)|
| 3:04:38| And if you want to know how I would come down on the ownership issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11078)|
| 3:04:44| I'd say all property in Knox County, owned by Knox County, needs to be titled to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11084)|
| 3:04:54| Now, if there is some compelling reason why I need to change my mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11094)|
| 3:04:58| then we'll work through that in the months to come and arrive at a basis for that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11098)|
| 3:05:08| One last thing, if we're --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11108)|
| 3:05:11| Well, I'm through, except for the third time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11111)|
| 3:05:16| Did you know Gibbs is a hundred-year-old?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11116)|
| 3:05:18| I had to say that one more time tonight so he'd be three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11118)|
| 3:05:22| I said it once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11122)|
| 3:05:23| Ms. Aguff said it once and now said it for the third time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11123)|
| 3:05:27| I appreciate you all's indulgence with me at trying to recognize Gibbs High School on its hundredth anniversary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11127)|
| 3:05:34| I want a hundredth anniversary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11134)|
| 3:05:37| Oh, fourth time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11137)|
| 3:05:38| Now I've got to say it two more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11138)|
| 3:05:42| Dr. McIntyre is not here, but I truly appreciate him coming the other night to celebrate with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11142)|
| 3:05:50| at Gibbs High School for our hundredth anniversary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11150)|
| 3:05:54| Now I've got one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11154)|
| 3:05:56| And at that same celebration of the hundredth year of Gibbs High School, Mayor Burchett was there also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11156)|
| 3:06:04| So if I've done it in perfect threes, I'm through with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11164)|
| 3:06:08| The next night after that, I'd also like to say that in community development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11168)|
| 3:06:13| I appreciate all the people, elected officials, department heads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11173)|
| 3:06:18| and directors that purchased a ticket for the Gibbs Ruitan Club 21st Annual Fundraising Dinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11178)|
| 3:06:32| Mayor Burchett was there also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11192)|
| 3:06:35| And I appreciate his attendance because I believe that he is working with the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11195)|
| 3:06:42| with the whole 8th District with Knox County in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11202)|
| 3:06:48| There is one other thing, though, that goes along with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11208)|
| 3:06:54| You've heard me mention a couple of things that just happened in the community where I represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11214)|
| 3:07:00| I'd like to bring another one really to the front and center for just a second, the Rotary Club of West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11220)|
| 3:07:07| That's the Rotary Club of West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11227)|
| 3:07:10| Back on May 4th weekend, they had a Rocky Top Hummin' and Strummin' barbecue cook-off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11230)|
| 3:07:19| in which there was $10,000 in prize money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11239)|
| 3:07:24| It was at the Episcopal School of Knoxville out west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11244)|
| 3:07:29| The Rotary Club, well, it's like the Ruitan Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11249)|
| 3:07:33| The Rotary Club promotes integrity and service to others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11253)|
| 3:07:37| Service to others in the community, the workplace, and around the globe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11257)|
| 3:07:42| Until I went to that cook-off, I didn't really realize they were really involved in the eradication of polio, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11262)|
| 3:07:50| Polio went away before I had Ms. Acuff in high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11270)|
| 3:07:58| Polio went away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11278)|
| 3:08:00| But still yet it's a valid being eradicated disease globally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11280)|
| 3:08:07| This particular cook-off was sanctioned by the Kansas City Barbecue Society, the KCBS as it's referred to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11287)|
| 3:08:16| They had $100,000 vehicles and barbecue stuff out there that was in more than $100,000 range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11296)|
| 3:08:28| And right in amongst it was Uncle Butch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11308)|
| 3:08:36| Uncle Butch's barbecue came in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11316)|
| 3:08:40| and also Uncle Butch's barbecue received the Commissioner's Choice Award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11320)|
| 3:08:48| So all those are my public service announcements for today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11328)|
| 3:08:53| My question of you is, who is Uncle Butch's nephew?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11333)|
| 3:08:57| Thanks, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11337)|
| 3:08:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11339)|
| 3:09:00| Thank you, Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11340)|
| 3:09:02| And I think we've got one more discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11342)|
| 3:09:04| Yes, that's regarding the audit meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11344)|
| 3:09:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11347)|
| 3:09:08| Audit Committee folks, would you like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11348)|
| 3:09:11| Mr. Schaff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11351)|
| 3:09:14| We meet possibly meeting one week from right now, June the 4th, 1 to 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11354)|
| 3:09:26| We had a meeting scheduled about a month ago, but it got caught up in the five-day notice thing and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11366)|
| 3:09:31| so it got canceled at the last minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11371)|
| 3:09:34| And this is hopefully the meeting where the current internal auditor office will either be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11374)|
| 3:09:45| well, it will be, it's changed somewhat, but it either will be bid out to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11385)|
| 3:09:51| or bid out is not the right word, contracted out to KPMG,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11391)|
| 3:09:55| because that's the only other entity that's made the cut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11395)|
| 3:09:58| or Richard Wallace's office as currently constituted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11398)|
| 3:10:03| or possibly he could have a different manner of office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11403)|
| 3:10:09| or mechanism to run the internal audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11409)|
| 3:10:13| But we've been talking about that for about two years and interviewing and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11413)|
| 3:10:17| so hopefully that will be resolved next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11417)|
| 3:10:20| What you're going to do is bring a recommendation back to the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11420)|
| 3:10:23| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11423)|
| 3:10:24| It will be whatever the majority of the Audit Committee determines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11424)|
| 3:10:29| There are five of us, so it will have to be three, a majority of three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11429)|
| 3:10:34| That recommendation will come to the County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11434)|
| 3:10:37| Commissioner Wright, you please elaborate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11437)|
| 3:10:40| No, I had turned my light on and turned it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11440)|
| 3:10:42| I think that's the position we find ourselves in as being members of the Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11442)|
| 3:10:49| I believe that we're asked or tasked to investigate that outsourcing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11449)|
| 3:10:57| or out-contracting or whatever you want to call it of the internal auditor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11457)|
| 3:11:01| and we've had lots of bumps in the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11461)|
| 3:11:05| but I think we're continuing to where we will get to where we can make, hopefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11465)|
| 3:11:12| a recommendation to the full commission about what should take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11472)|
| 3:11:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11479)|
| 3:11:20| Anything else towards the Audit Committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11480)|
| 3:11:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11483)|
| 3:11:24| Any other items here before we adjourn until 5 o'clock for zonings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11484)|
| 3:11:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11490)|
| 3:11:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11491)|
| 3:11:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11497)|
| 3:11:38| We are starting our zoning section of our May meeting, and we've got to be out of here at 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11498)|
| 3:11:46| So keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11506)|
| 3:11:49| We may have to shift over to the small assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11509)|
| 3:11:53| So no public announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11513)|
| 3:11:56| Well, we're going to try to keep everything short, as short and quick as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11516)|
| 3:12:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11521)|
| 3:12:02| First item, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11522)|
| 3:12:04| Oh, roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11524)|
| 3:12:05| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11525)|
| 3:12:06| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11526)|
| 3:12:07| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11527)|
| 3:12:08| Commissioner Boyles is absent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11528)|
| 3:12:09| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11529)|

| 3:12:13| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11533)|
| 3:12:14| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11534)|
| 3:12:15| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11535)|
| 3:12:16| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11536)|

| 3:12:18| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11538)|
| 3:12:19| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11539)|
| 3:12:20| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11540)|
| 3:12:21| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11541)|
| 3:12:22| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11542)|
| 3:12:23| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11543)|
| 3:12:24| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11544)|
| 3:12:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11545)|
| 3:12:26| The first request is a Browder Metal Recycling for South County Sector Plan Amendment from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11546)|
| 3:12:37| L1 Light Industrial, AG-RR Agricultural Rural Residential and SLPA Slope Protection Area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11557)|
| 3:12:47| to HI Heavy Industrial and SLP Slope Protection Area, property located east end of Valgro| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11567)|
| 3:12:55| Road, east of Sevierville Pike, 9th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11575)|
| 3:12:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11579)|
| 3:13:01| Who is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11581)|
| 3:13:08| Mr. Chairman, Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue, with Mr. Ed Browder and Mr. Chris| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11588)|
| 3:13:14| Browder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11594)|
| 3:13:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11595)|
| 3:13:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11596)|
| 3:13:17| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11597)|
| 3:13:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11598)|
| 3:13:19| Well, do we need to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11599)|
| 3:13:20| Let's have a motion and get it out on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11600)|
| 3:13:29| I'm going to make the motion to approve, but before I do, I would like to ask Mr. Ed Browder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11609)|
| 3:13:35| if he could take about one minute and explain to those who are watching what his proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11615)|
| 3:13:43| uses and how he's going to handle the usage on this particular development because there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11623)|
| 3:13:50| was some question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11630)|
| 3:13:52| And he's allayed my fears, but I would like for him to get that on public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11632)|
| 3:13:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11636)|
| 3:13:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11637)|
| 3:13:59| We've got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11639)|
| 3:14:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11640)|
| 3:14:01| Go ahead, Mr. Browder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11641)|
| 3:14:03| I'm Ed Browder, 1126 Firethorn Way, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11643)|
| 3:14:09| First of all, we're in the recycling business, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11649)|
| 3:14:12| And we also intend to run an automotive towing business, which shares some similarities with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11652)|
| 3:14:18| the recycling with picking up cars, which we're already doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11658)|
| 3:14:22| We need a secure holding yard for the towing business as well as a secure yard for processing the metal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11662)|
| 3:14:32| For example, when we bring a car in, we take the various metals, the aluminum, the copper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11672)|
| 3:14:39| the radiators, and remove all the fluids, pump them into barrels, and separate everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11679)|
| 3:14:46| And then the carcass of the cars, we intend to sell to PSC, which is approximately less than 10 miles from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11686)|
| 3:14:53| facility that we intend to open at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11693)|
| 3:14:55| So we're not going to be crushing cars or shredding or anything that intense on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11695)|
| 3:15:02| We're going to be relying on PSC, which they're in the Forks of the River Industrial Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11702)|
| 3:15:08| and they have a mega shredder there, and that's where a lot of our metal is going to end up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11708)|
| 3:15:14| I've done the best I can to talk to the local community and address their concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11714)|
| 3:15:20| One of the concerns is with the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11720)|
| 3:15:22| They have a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11722)|
| 3:15:24| There's a church at the entrance of the industrial park, Valley Grove Baptist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11724)|
| 3:15:28| And they have a playground that's close to the entrance of the industrial park that's exposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11728)|
| 3:15:35| And so the solution that I'd like to offer them is put up a row of Leland cypress trees to create a barrier for dust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11735)|
| 3:15:45| and sound and visual barrier as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11745)|
| 3:15:49| And then the other concern that I've come across is basic security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11749)|
| 3:15:53| And I've offered the industrial park, we would like to put up a gate at our expense for the entire industrial park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11753)|
| 3:16:01| to keep after-hours traffic from, you know, coming back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11761)|
| 3:16:04| And then the other security that I'm offering is the building that we have a contract on has an apartment in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11764)|
| 3:16:11| So we would like to have someone staying in that apartment, you know, 24 hours or, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11771)|
| 3:16:18| at least at nighttime after hours to, you know, keep an eye on things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11778)|
| 3:16:22| And not to mention we're going to have our own, you know, fence around the yard and security cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11782)|
| 3:16:29| You know, security is an issue for us as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11789)|
| 3:16:31| And in my opinion, our presence will increase the security for the entire park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11791)|
| 3:16:36| because right now you go there after hours and, you know, there's nobody really watching the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11796)|
| 3:16:43| Other than that, you know, we're going to be collecting various metals from off-site with roll-off containers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11803)|
| 3:16:51| bring them in, separate the metal, prepare it for shipping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11811)|
| 3:16:54| And that pretty much sums up the basic idea of what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11814)|
| 3:16:58| I'll be glad to answer any questions that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11818)|
| 3:17:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11821)|
| 3:17:02| Thank you, Mr. Browder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11822)|
| 3:17:03| Mr. Bram.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11823)|
| 3:17:04| One other point I need, and I think this is a very important point, can't even talk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11824)|
| 3:17:10| is that we will not be soliciting from the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11830)|
| 3:17:16| Eighty percent of this stuff is all being collected at job sites and big bins and stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11836)|
| 3:17:21| and brought in, you know, 15, 18 truckloads maybe a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11841)|
| 3:17:25| But, you know, you can't go out here and pick up a couple of garbage bags full of aluminum cans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11845)|
| 3:17:30| and take it in there to sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11850)|
| 3:17:32| You'll have to do that at PSC, which I think will cut down a lot on the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11852)|
| 3:17:38| They are going to improve that road somewhat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11858)|
| 3:17:41| If you're familiar with that location from the church back to the actual industrial complex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11861)|
| 3:17:47| it's part of the old Bower Industries, and that road is a private road from that point back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11867)|
| 3:17:53| But he has worked with one of the Bower daughters and her husband about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11873)|
| 3:17:59| some of these issues of putting up the gate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11879)|
| 3:18:01| He has permission to do that and so forth and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11881)|
| 3:18:03| So after spending about 30 minutes with him, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11883)|
| 3:18:07| I'm satisfied that it will be a good investment for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11887)|
| 3:18:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11893)|
| 3:18:14| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11894)|
| 3:18:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11895)|
| 3:18:16| My question is to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11896)|
| 3:18:17| If the action is to approve here tonight by commission, what's the next step?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11897)|
| 3:18:25| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11905)|
| 3:18:27| It has to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11907)|
| 3:18:28| Anything he does will have to come back under use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11908)|
| 3:18:31| So there is, you know, a follow-up, checkups on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11911)|
| 3:18:36| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11916)|
| 3:18:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11917)|
| 3:18:39| Commissioner Browse, if you vote to approve the MPC recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11919)|
| 3:18:44| the EC zone requires site plan review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11924)|
| 3:18:47| So that would be a second step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11927)|
| 3:18:49| And we could get into a little bit more detail about the issues that Mr. Browder talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11929)|
| 3:18:54| and firm that up at that particular point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11934)|
| 3:18:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11939)|
| 3:19:00| Any other questions, discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11940)|
| 3:19:02| What's your guys' timetable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11942)|
| 3:19:04| What are you looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11944)|
| 3:19:06| As far as starting the business, to be honest with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11946)|
| 3:19:10| the property that we're trying to purchase that we have a contract on is it needs quite a bit of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11950)|
| 3:19:17| There's the yard area has been used as a community dumping ground for who knows how long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11957)|
| 3:19:22| There's about 75 boats sitting on it right now, along with piles of tires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11962)|
| 3:19:27| and just debris that is going to have to be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11967)|
| 3:19:30| So that will be the first, you know, obstacle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11970)|
| 3:19:32| And then gravel it and follow the site plan that's approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11972)|
| 3:19:38| And then various repairs to the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11978)|
| 3:19:41| Really, to be honest with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11981)|
| 3:19:42| I would say we'd be doing good to be in business by the first of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11982)|
| 3:19:49| And that's optimistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11989)|
| 3:19:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11992)|
| 3:19:53| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11993)|
| 3:19:55| Is there a motion to approve before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=11995)|
| 3:20:00| Per MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12000)|
| 3:20:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12004)|
| 3:20:05| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12005)|

| 3:21:37| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12097)|
| 3:21:38| I'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12098)|
| 3:21:39| Thank you, Chairman Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12099)|
| 3:21:40| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12100)|
| 3:21:43| This is just a very short point about the sector planning process as this is being considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12103)|
| 3:21:49| The point that I wanted to make is that this area out here is very much agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12109)|
| 3:21:55| There's no adjacent commercial property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12115)|
| 3:21:58| There's really no commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12118)|
| 3:22:00| I think there's no non-agricultural property within at least a mile radius of this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12120)|
| 3:22:04| So as we're considering this, what I'm concerned about is just establishing potentially the precedent for additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12124)|
| 3:22:13| commercial zoning at this place when the sector plan is very clear about the theme for that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12133)|
| 3:22:18| staying agricultural and rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12138)|
| 3:22:20| Now, this particular lot I do understand is it is problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12140)|
| 3:22:24| It's only .3 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12144)|
| 3:22:25| It's on a corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12145)|
| 3:22:28| I agree, it's not suitable for residential use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12148)|
| 3:22:31| It's not really suitable for agricultural use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12151)|
| 3:22:33| Commercial makes sense for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12153)|
| 3:22:35| And the planning commission staff has put together a good recommendation for the least impactful commercial zone underneath it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12155)|
| 3:22:41| as well as the least impactful sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12161)|
| 3:22:43| So that's good, and I appreciate those motives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12163)|
| 3:22:46| What I guess I would just ask is that as commissioners considering this, it expresses sentiment either one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12166)|
| 3:22:53| is your sentiment to just a very small fix for this very difficult lot in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12173)|
| 3:22:59| or is the sentiment to change the sector plan and to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12179)|
| 3:23:03| start recognizing commercial activity at that intersection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12183)|
| 3:23:07| And that's a, you know, towards the second one, that's a very big change in what's called for in the sector plan there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12187)|
| 3:23:14| and that's one that I think the community would certainly want to be involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12194)|
| 3:23:17| So that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12197)|
| 3:23:18| I just would ask that the commission think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12198)|
| 3:23:20| And I'm really trying to avoid that by zoning this or by changing the sector plan to make this commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12200)|
| 3:23:26| that that be used as sort of something where the camel's nose gets in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12206)|
| 3:23:29| and a number of parcels around it start becoming commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12209)|
| 3:23:32| And then that's definitely not, I think, what the sector plan is calling for out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12212)|
| 3:23:36| And that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12216)|
| 3:23:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12217)|
| 3:23:38| Thank you, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12218)|
| 3:23:40| Mr. Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12220)|
| 3:23:41| I just want to make a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12221)|
| 3:23:43| If this is the little general store that I'm thinking about on the corner of Ridgeview and Emery Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12223)|
| 3:23:48| it's been a store for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12228)|
| 3:23:51| And I think that actually they're trying to spruce it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12231)|
| 3:23:57| And the only reason it's agriculture is because it sold milk and the zoning is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12237)|
| 3:24:01| But you couldn't, there's more ridges and slopes around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12241)|
| 3:24:04| There's not another piece of flat property out there to put it any more commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12244)|
| 3:24:08| And so once this comes back up before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12248)|
| 3:24:11| I think it's important to note that this has been a store before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12251)|
| 3:24:15| and it's just kind of getting cleaned up and spruced up and back to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12255)|
| 3:24:20| So it's actually, looking at the map, there's industrial driver nine iron away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12260)|
| 3:24:25| There's commercial business behind or just off Tassel Park and Atkins Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12265)|
| 3:24:30| So there are warehouses within, you know, a thousand feet as the crow flies, I would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12270)|
| 3:24:35| So just take that into consideration on this next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12275)|
| 3:24:43| Did we have a second on the substitute to defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12283)|
| 3:24:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12289)|
| 3:24:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12290)|
| 3:24:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12291)|
| 3:24:52| Can we wait until the end of the meeting in case they show up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12292)|
| 3:24:54| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12294)|
| 3:24:55| Yeah, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12295)|
| 3:24:56| We'll roll it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12296)|
| 3:24:57| We'll roll it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12297)|
| 3:24:58| Kevin, so stick around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12298)|
| 3:25:04| Yeah, so skip it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12304)|
| 3:25:05| Skip it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12305)|
| 3:25:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12306)|
| 3:25:07| We're going to request of Primus Land Company, LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12307)|
| 3:25:10| for rezoning from A, Agricultural, and R.A., Low Density Residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12310)|
| 3:25:14| to P.R., Planned Residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12314)|

| 3:25:23| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12323)|
| 3:25:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12329)|
| 3:25:30| Let's roll that one back, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12330)|
| 3:25:33| Request of Jack Walker for rezoning from R.B., General Residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12333)|
| 3:25:36| to C.R., Rural Commercial, a property located northeast side, Tillett Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12336)|

| 3:25:48| Move to approve for MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12348)|
| 3:25:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12352)|
| 3:25:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12355)|
| 3:25:56| Is there any opposition here to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12356)|
| 3:25:59| Didn't we defer this last month because he wasn't here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12359)|
| 3:26:03| He's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12363)|
| 3:26:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12364)|
| 3:26:06| Mr. Walker, do you have anything to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12366)|
| 3:26:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12368)|
| 3:26:11| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12371)|
| 3:26:13| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12373)|
| 3:26:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12374)|
| 3:26:15| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12375)|
| 3:26:16| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12376)|
| 3:26:17| Thanks for working that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12377)|
| 3:26:19| Request of Leon Sherrod for rezoning from P.R., Planned Residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12379)|
| 3:26:22| to A, Agricultural, a property located on the east and west sides of Arnold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12382)|
| 3:26:27| Lane, east of Clear Springs Road, 8th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12387)|
| 3:26:32| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12392)|
| 3:26:35| Come forward, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12395)|
| 3:26:36| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12396)|
| 3:26:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12400)|
| 3:26:41| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12401)|
| 3:26:42| Move to approve for MPC recommendation minus the condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12402)|
| 3:26:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12409)|
| 3:26:50| Let me hear what the condition is first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12410)|
| 3:26:53| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12413)|
| 3:26:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12414)|
| 3:26:55| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12415)|
| 3:26:57| Go ahead, Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12417)|
| 3:26:58| Do you want to explain the condition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12418)|
| 3:27:00| If you look at the package, it says a cul-de-sac at the end of the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12420)|
| 3:27:05| to turn around a large vehicle or bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12425)|
| 3:27:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12433)|
| 3:27:14| Any discussion around the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12434)|
| 3:27:17| Mr. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12437)|
| 3:27:19| Yes, I'd just like to ask MPC to get a feel for why that, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12439)|
| 3:27:23| during the course of you all's evaluation or MPC, why that would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12443)|
| 3:27:27| I mean, I would assume buses will go down that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12447)|
| 3:27:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12452)|
| 3:27:33| Mr. McKenzie, in fact, that was a condition that was left over, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12453)|
| 3:27:37| from the previous time the project was considered or the property was rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12457)|
| 3:27:43| The fact is that's an awfully long cul-de-sac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12463)|
| 3:27:46| We feel like, you know, buses, school buses that serve those properties would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12466)|
| 3:27:52| need a sufficient way and sufficient manner to turn around and be able to back out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12472)|
| 3:27:59| It's simply a matter of being able to serve those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12479)|
| 3:28:02| You know, if the road were shorter, it might not be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12482)|
| 3:28:06| but you're going down a very long cul-de-sac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12486)|
| 3:28:08| It appears to be at the end of a road that's 1,500 to 2,000 feet long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12488)|
| 3:28:16| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12496)|
| 3:28:17| Just judging from the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12497)|
| 3:28:19| Yeah, that's a dead end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12499)|
| 3:28:21| Yeah, that's a dead end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12501)|
| 3:28:26| I guess I'm not going to commission it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12506)|
| 3:28:28| That doesn't seem like very good planning without that condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12508)|
| 3:28:36| As MPC stated, this is a carryover from a previous plan that was never implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12516)|
| 3:28:41| There's not a cul-de-sac there now, is there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12521)|
| 3:28:47| There is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12527)|
| 3:28:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12528)|
| 3:28:49| So what we're asking is that this young lady has a five-acre lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12529)|
| 3:28:57| She's three months into a building contract with only six months left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12537)|
| 3:29:01| and she can't get through the bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12541)|
| 3:29:04| And if we require a cul-de-sac at the end of the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12544)|
| 3:29:08| it's someone else's property that we're requiring it to be on, in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12548)|
| 3:29:14| It's affecting different lots than the one that this lady is just trying to get rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12554)|
| 3:29:20| from planned residential to agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12560)|
| 3:29:23| When I first looked at it, I thought they were all small lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12563)|
| 3:29:26| but they're five acres to 14-acre lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12566)|
| 3:29:32| Right-of-way is how wide is the right-of-way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12572)|
| 3:29:36| And whenever I looked at KGIS, I couldn't tell whether it was a right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12576)|
| 3:29:39| a county road, or a joint permanent easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12579)|
| 3:29:43| It's probably approximately 16 feet within a 40-foot right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12583)|
| 3:29:50| Right, 40-foot right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12590)|
| 3:29:53| So I guess, you know, I still say once this place is developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12593)|
| 3:30:02| we're going to end up with a tough, tough time if we don't have a cul-de-sac there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12602)|
| 3:30:08| So I guess my question is, and I don't know the answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12608)|
| 3:30:13| is would this condition prevent this particular property from being finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12613)|
| 3:30:21| Maybe I'm asking the MPC that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12621)|
| 3:30:22| Is that something that will prevent this parcel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12622)|
| 3:30:30| I, Mark Donaldson with MPC, certainly not from our perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12630)|
| 3:30:37| By rezoning this to agriculture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12637)|
| 3:30:39| it will take the MPC out of the further review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12639)|
| 3:30:43| They've already played their hand as far as exempting the properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12643)|
| 3:30:47| from the subdivision regulations by keeping all of the lots at five acres or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12647)|
| 3:30:54| So we have no further review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12654)|
| 3:30:57| There might be some permitting issues, but I'm not sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12657)|
| 3:31:02| and perhaps it's the financial industry that would look at it and take a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12662)|
| 3:31:11| I would just hate for us to build a quarter-of-a-mile street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12671)|
| 3:31:15| where a bus can't turn around on when we know we're building places that's going to have children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12675)|
| 3:31:23| So I just struggle with, and like you said, once we rezone this, that's kind of the end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12683)|
| 3:31:31| And then this road's going to end up getting built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12691)|
| 3:31:35| So I just, I'm struggling with that condition being removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12695)|
| 3:31:43| Okay. Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12703)|
| 3:31:44| Would you go ahead, your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12704)|
| 3:31:46| Natalie Rogers, 10112 Weta Lane, 37871.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12706)|
| 3:31:53| Arnold Lane is a dead-end county road and mascot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12713)|
| 3:31:57| and it has been such for as long as I can remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12717)|
| 3:32:01| I'm 42.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12721)|
| 3:32:02| I mean, it's been a dead end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12722)|
| 3:32:03| You know, the dead end sign is there on your county street sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12723)|
| 3:32:08| This is, with the issue of the school bus and everything, you know, my issue is why is that relevant now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12728)|
| 3:32:18| You know, all the homes that have been on Arnold Lane for the past 40, 50 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12738)|
| 3:32:24| I mean, why is it just now that at the end of the street it's required?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12744)|
| 3:32:30| You know, it's five acre tracks or larger, one house per five acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12750)|
| 3:32:37| We bought this in June of 10 at auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12757)|
| 3:32:40| And two of our, you know, it's 17 private individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12760)|
| 3:32:45| Two of those folks came down here and got permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12765)|
| 3:32:48| My builder came down here in March and was turned away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12768)|
| 3:32:53| No one, the last permit that was, one of the tract owners got was in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12773)|
| 3:33:00| Well, my builder came down here in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12780)|
| 3:33:03| Nowhere between September and March were any of us notified there was going to be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12783)|
| 3:33:07| I sold my home and I closed on my construction loan at Home Federal the first of March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12787)|
| 3:33:13| I've eaten three months of that nine-month loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12793)|
| 3:33:17| I've paid all those closing costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12797)|
| 3:33:20| You know, I've worked my behind off to get my property paid for to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12800)|
| 3:33:26| All I want is just for this to be finished up so that I can get that permit and start building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12806)|
| 3:33:33| You know, I don't see, like I said, it's been a county, country road forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12813)|
| 3:33:40| And, you know, where does the bus, if there's children, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12820)|
| 3:33:44| ride up until that last few feet, where is it turning around now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12824)|
| 3:33:47| Why is that my issue and responsibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12827)|
| 3:33:51| So, you know, and it's just flat, wide open spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12831)|
| 3:33:56| There's plenty of room to turn around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12836)|
| 3:33:58| It's flat and even and, you know, I don't think that should be an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12838)|
| 3:34:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12843)|
| 3:34:04| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12844)|
| 3:34:05| The thing that I'd like to interject into it is that this being agricultural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12845)|
| 3:34:10| it would then be held to the same standards as the rest of Knox County about providing cul-de-sacs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12850)|
| 3:34:16| It's no longer planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12856)|
| 3:34:19| It will be agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12859)|
| 3:34:21| And I guess I could say MPCs wanting to reach out and touch it while they can, but that's not my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12861)|
| 3:34:29| The point that I'm making is that they would then be they would have to play by the rules of the rest of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12869)|
| 3:34:36| if we just return them to ag zoning without the one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12876)|
| 3:34:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12881)|
| 3:34:42| Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12882)|
| 3:34:44| I guess my question, I guess, is for MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12884)|
| 3:34:47| So there's houses already on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12887)|
| 3:34:49| This is kind of a similar situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12889)|
| 3:34:50| We were talking about houses already on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12890)|
| 3:34:53| And so we're requiring the last homeowner to get a cul-de-sac, which is not adjoining to their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12893)|
| 3:34:59| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12899)|
| 3:35:00| Well, keep in mind that this property was rezoned from ag to planned residential in 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12900)|
| 3:35:07| And Knox County Commission put that condition on the zoning at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12907)|
| 3:35:13| And subsequent to that, they recorded a plat that was exempt from the subdivision regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12913)|
| 3:35:21| which would have required adequate right of way and a cul-de-sac by platting lots that were greater than five acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12921)|
| 3:35:32| So we have no further way of enforcing the Knox County regulations, the subdivision regulations, in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12932)|
| 3:35:42| So the way it's platted and everything, you can't enforce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12942)|
| 3:35:45| So we put it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12945)|
| 3:35:47| Can we take it out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12947)|
| 3:35:48| And does that create a heartburn for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12948)|
| 3:35:50| Well, yes, because as ag property, each one of those five-acre parcels could later subdivide into four-acre-plus parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12950)|
| 3:36:02| And ultimately, we could end up with nearly the density that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12962)|
| 3:36:08| She's not trying to subdivide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12968)|
| 3:36:10| She's trying to rezone, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12970)|
| 3:36:11| I mean, I know you're talking about semantics and it could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12971)|
| 3:36:16| I just don't think it's fair that she's held up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12976)|
| 3:36:18| I don't either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12978)|
| 3:36:19| I just don't think it's fair that she's held up when nobody else has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12979)|
| 3:36:22| and we've not enforced that cul-de-sac on anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12982)|
| 3:36:26| We didn't enforce it in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12986)|
| 3:36:28| I can't speak to the previous permits, but as planned residential zoning, in order to pull a building permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12988)|
| 3:36:37| there should have been a development plan approved by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=12997)|
| 3:36:41| There was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13001)|
| 3:36:43| That is the process by which we would have enforced that condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13003)|
| 3:36:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13007)|
| 3:36:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13008)|
| 3:36:49| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13009)|
| 3:36:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13010)|
| 3:36:52| From what I understand, ma'am, I know that you can't probably see that from there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13012)|
| 3:36:56| but if you got on a road coming in here, back here to where we're talking about a proposed cul-de-sac,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13016)|
| 3:37:02| your property is over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13022)|
| 3:37:04| You do not touch this end of the road, do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13024)|
| 3:37:06| May I come up there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13026)|
| 3:37:07| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13027)|
| 3:37:11| If your property is back here, you're not contiguous to this end of the road, are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13031)|
| 3:37:20| I don't claim to be an artist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13040)|
| 3:37:25| What I'm saying is your property does not abut the end of the road property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13045)|
| 3:37:35| Then that should be a moot point in this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13055)|
| 3:37:39| It doesn't affect her because she's not at the end of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13059)|
| 3:37:44| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13064)|
| 3:37:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13073)|
| 3:37:55| Mr. Ham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13075)|
| 3:37:58| Just in listening to the discussion, it sounds to me like this is one of those things where she has gotten caught up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13078)|
| 3:38:03| on governmental red tape and it's not any fault of hers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13083)|
| 3:38:07| I'm going to be voting to go ahead and give her the recommendation without the condition because, to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13087)|
| 3:38:13| the condition seems to be unreasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13093)|
| 3:38:16| And so I'm going to be voting to go ahead and let you get on with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13096)|
| 3:38:20| Mr. McKenzie, you have another?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13100)|
| 3:38:22| Yes, just a general statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13102)|
| 3:38:24| I agree that this is an unfortunate timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13104)|
| 3:38:28| But I guess I'll say, you know, we've got to start righting these wrongs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13108)|
| 3:38:33| We've got a lot of bad developer development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13113)|
| 3:38:36| This sounds like this was one, you know, someone plotting back and forth, agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13116)|
| 3:38:42| I don't know, plan residential helps me out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13122)|
| 3:38:44| No, agriculture takes away the whole responsibility of a cul-de-sac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13124)|
| 3:38:49| So, you know, while this one is very unfortunate and, you know, I'm going to support her endeavor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13129)|
| 3:38:57| I just think we've got to sometimes make these tough decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13137)|
| 3:39:00| And this is a little too far, a little too far gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13140)|
| 3:39:04| But we come across these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13144)|
| 3:39:07| We know there were bad developers, bad developments that were put out there, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13147)|
| 3:39:13| So this is very unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13153)|
| 3:39:16| But I don't think we should, you know, just give a pass to all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13156)|
| 3:39:21| Again, I'm going to support this motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13161)|
| 3:39:25| but I think we're going to have to start taking some hard looks at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13165)|
| 3:39:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13170)|
| 3:39:31| We've got a motion to approve without the condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13171)|
| 3:39:34| We need a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13174)|
| 3:39:37| I guess that will suffice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13177)|
| 3:39:40| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13180)|
| 3:39:42| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13182)|
| 3:39:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13183)|
| 3:39:44| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13184)|
| 3:39:45| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13185)|
| 3:39:47| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13187)|
| 3:39:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13188)|
| 3:39:49| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13189)|
| 3:39:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13190)|

| 3:39:57| Consideration of an ordinance of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13197)|

| 3:40:17| And this is 102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13217)|
| 3:40:19| Before we start this, I don't think any of the Corcorans haven't showed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13219)|
| 3:40:24| and Primos hasn't showed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13224)|
| 3:40:27| Mr. Chairman, I spoke to Mr. Corcoran last week and also just a few minutes ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13227)|
| 3:40:32| I was going to ask if the agent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13232)|
| 3:40:36| the guy that's going to be renting the store from him was supposed to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13236)|
| 3:40:39| I was going to ask the commission to entertain the thought of suspending the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13239)|
| 3:40:43| to approve this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13243)|
| 3:40:46| It's up to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13246)|
| 3:40:47| Suspending the rules to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13247)|
| 3:40:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13249)|
| 3:40:50| I'd like to make that a form of motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13250)|
| 3:40:51| I think it has to have seven affirmative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13251)|
| 3:40:55| Is that correct, Daniel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13255)|
| 3:40:58| Two-thirds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13258)|
| 3:40:59| Two-thirds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13259)|
| 3:41:00| Eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13260)|
| 3:41:01| Let's go with eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13261)|
| 3:41:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13262)|
| 3:41:03| So we've got to have a vote to suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13263)|
| 3:41:06| So we'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13266)|
| 3:41:09| All in favor of suspending the rules for this vote say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13269)|
| 3:41:13| I need a second for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13273)|
| 3:41:14| We need a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13274)|
| 3:41:15| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13275)|
| 3:41:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13276)|
| 3:41:17| All in favor of suspending the rules for this vote say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13277)|
| 3:41:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13280)|
| 3:41:21| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13281)|
| 3:41:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13282)|
| 3:41:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13284)|
| 3:41:25| We have one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13285)|
| 3:41:28| Is that satisfying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13288)|
| 3:41:32| It's nine to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13292)|
| 3:41:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13294)|
| 3:41:35| So we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13295)|
| 3:41:39| I'd like to make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13299)|
| 3:41:44| I'd like to make a motion to approve per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13304)|
| 3:41:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13307)|
| 3:41:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13309)|
| 3:41:50| We've got a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13310)|
| 3:41:51| Yeah, 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13311)|
| 3:41:53| Four E, 13 SB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13313)|
| 3:41:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13316)|
| 3:41:57| And then the only, any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13317)|
| 3:42:01| The only question that I'd have would be Mr. Murphy's concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13321)|
| 3:42:05| Buzz, or Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13325)|
| 3:42:08| Would you, so in the future, does this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13328)|
| 3:42:14| is this going to change the way we look at the sector plan just on improving this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13334)|
| 3:42:22| I mean, how does that affect this intersection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13342)|
| 3:42:25| I don't see this intersection developing as a commercial hub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13345)|
| 3:42:30| The topography is really constrained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13350)|
| 3:42:33| The Y intersection is really constraining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13353)|
| 3:42:36| There's another fairly significant road that comes in just a ways down from the Y.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13356)|
| 3:42:45| It's a tough one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13365)|
| 3:42:46| So I really don't see, through the sector plan update process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13366)|
| 3:42:52| us looking to expand the commercial activity here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13372)|
| 3:42:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13376)|
| 3:42:57| We've got the director of the MPC on record of making his statement, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13377)|
| 3:43:04| So you've got that for putting in your bag if you need it later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13384)|
| 3:43:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13389)|
| 3:43:10| Motion before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13390)|
| 3:43:13| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13393)|
| 3:43:15| Brad, what's he going to, just going to make a store out of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13395)|
| 3:43:18| He just rented it back out as a little general store again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13398)|
| 3:43:20| He just had to change it because, for some reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13400)|
| 3:43:23| he had to change the zoning on it from agriculture to rural commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13403)|
| 3:43:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13407)|
| 3:43:28| Could we have a second for this motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13408)|
| 3:43:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13411)|
| 3:43:32| We shall set the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13412)|
| 3:43:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13414)|
| 3:43:35| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13415)|
| 3:43:36| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13416)|

| 3:43:40| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13420)|

| 3:43:42| One pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13422)|
| 3:43:43| We'll have to do that on the next one also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13423)|
| 3:43:45| I'd like to make a motion to suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13425)|
| 3:43:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13427)|
| 3:43:50| All in favor of suspending the rules for this second part say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13430)|
| 3:43:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13434)|

| 3:43:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13437)|
| 3:43:58| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13438)|
| 3:44:00| I'd like to make a motion to approve pending or based on MPC's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13440)|
| 3:44:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13444)|
| 3:44:05| And a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13445)|
| 3:44:06| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13446)|
| 3:44:08| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13448)|

| 3:44:14| One pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13454)|
| 3:44:15| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13455)|
| 3:44:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13462)|
| 3:44:24| Primos Land Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13464)|
| 3:44:26| Anybody here from Primos?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13466)|
| 3:44:29| I'd like to defer that for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13469)|
| 3:44:32| I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13472)|
| 3:44:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13473)|
| 3:44:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13474)|
| 3:44:35| Motion to defer for 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13475)|
| 3:44:37| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13477)|
| 3:44:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13478)|
| 3:44:39| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13479)|
| 3:44:40| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13480)|
| 3:44:44| And now we're on to EMC's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13484)|
| 3:44:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13495)|
| 3:44:56| We have Margo Clines here to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13496)|
| 3:44:57| Let's go ahead and get it on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13497)|
| 3:44:58| Do we have a recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13498)|
| 3:44:59| I mean, do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13499)|
| 3:45:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13500)|
| 3:45:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13501)|
| 3:45:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13502)|
| 3:45:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13503)|
| 3:45:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13504)|

| 3:45:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13508)|
| 3:45:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13509)|
| 3:45:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13510)|

| 3:45:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13516)|
| 3:45:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13517)|
| 3:45:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13518)|
| 3:45:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13519)|
| 3:45:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13520)|
| 3:45:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13521)|
| 3:45:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13522)|
| 3:45:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13523)|
| 3:45:24| We have a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13524)|
| 3:45:28| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13528)|
| 3:45:29| In a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13529)|
| 3:45:31| Mr. Brown for the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13531)|
| 3:45:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13533)|
| 3:45:34| Miss Klein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13534)|
| 3:45:35| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13535)|
| 3:45:36| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13536)|
| 3:45:37| Margo Klein, 8845 Ebenezer Oaks Lane, and I'm here today on behalf of both Scenic Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13537)|
| 3:45:46| and the Council of West Knox County Homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13546)|
| 3:45:49| I really want to thank you all for the work you've done on this, and at this point it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13549)|
| 3:45:54| appears that the majority of you do plan to vote in favor, or did at least on the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13554)|
| 3:45:59| reading, so I'm hopeful that that will be the case this time as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13559)|
| 3:46:04| I did hand out a little handout here to you, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13564)|
| 3:46:07| There's one part of this ordinance that has not really been discussed, and I believe Joyce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13567)|
| 3:46:15| Feld was going to bring it up last time, and there wasn't any discussion at all in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13575)|
| 3:46:19| the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13579)|
| 3:46:21| This has to do with only the part that looks at the allowance of 100 square feet for an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13581)|
| 3:46:28| EMC, and I understand that that is the wording in the city, and the majority of the wording| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13588)|
| 3:46:35| has been adopted from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13595)|
| 3:46:37| However, when the city passed its ordinance, they banned all new EMCs, so it was kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13597)|
| 3:46:44| a moot point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13604)|
| 3:46:45| It just wasn't changed because there was no need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13605)|
| 3:46:48| In this case, because we're not asking for a ban, we're asking for regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13608)|
| 3:46:54| We would like to have you at least discuss this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13614)|
| 3:46:58| What I passed out to you is an industry newsletter story about an EMC that's in Sevierville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13618)|
| 3:47:06| and as we all know, Sevierville has a lot of these signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13626)|
| 3:47:09| But Sevierville is an area where there are a lot of amusement parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13629)|
| 3:47:13| It may be appropriate in those sections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13633)|
| 3:47:15| That's not to be discussed, but that is a 100 square foot sign, and it shows all this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13635)|
| 3:47:22| animation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13642)|
| 3:47:23| If you've driven up there recently, it's really very large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13643)|
| 3:47:27| I mean, that sign up there is probably 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13647)|
| 3:47:30| The purchase is maybe 12 by 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13650)|
| 3:47:32| That's pretty close to the size we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13652)|
| 3:47:34| So, I mean, we would hope that you would change that to 36 square feet, which certainly for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13654)|
| 3:47:41| a street sign would allow three feet height, which is at least two rows of the largest type that is the minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13661)|
| 3:47:52| And correct me if I'm wrong on my math here, but 12, that would be three feet by 12 feet or six feet by six feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13672)|
| 3:48:02| That is a pretty big sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13682)|
| 3:48:04| I don't know that there are any existing EMCs right now that wouldn't be able to continue and be completely, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13684)|
| 3:48:12| or add at that size and be completely legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13692)|
| 3:48:16| But the concern here is that there are quite a number of larger stores and hotels that are being built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13696)|
| 3:48:25| or have already been built up and down the interstate that if this 100 square foot is allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13705)|
| 3:48:31| could put basically a small digital billboard on the side of their building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13711)|
| 3:48:35| And so that's just all I would like to bring up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13715)|
| 3:48:38| Otherwise, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13718)|
| 3:48:41| Thank you, Ms. Klein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13721)|
| 3:48:43| Mr. Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13723)|
| 3:48:44| I just want to clarify with Mr. Sanders, this is not a ban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13724)|
| 3:48:47| This is just regulation, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13727)|
| 3:48:50| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13730)|
| 3:48:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13731)|
| 3:48:56| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13736)|
| 3:49:03| No other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130528?start=13743)|
