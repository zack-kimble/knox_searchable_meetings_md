| 2:24:09| Any more discussion topics?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8649)|
| 2:24:13| I had one for our junior commission, but it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8653)|
| 2:24:19| We'll email it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8659)|
| 2:24:22| I had a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8662)|
| 2:24:23| I was going to ask our junior commissioners to be thinking of discussion topics for their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8663)|
| 2:24:29| agenda for their mock meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8669)|

| 2:24:38| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8678)|
| 2:24:39| And if you come up with something, to email Drusilla.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8679)|
| 2:24:42| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8682)|
| 2:24:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8683)|
| 2:24:44| And that's what we're doing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8684)|
| 2:24:46| We're going through, talking about what's important to us and dates that are coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8686)|
| 2:24:52| up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8692)|
| 2:24:53| We haven't gotten our reminder from Commissioner Daley, but I'm just waiting on it for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8693)|
| 2:24:59| cleanup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8699)|

| 2:25:03| No, thank you for mentioning that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8703)|

| 2:25:08| Well, I mean, when's the date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8708)|
| 2:25:11| Go ahead and say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8711)|
| 2:25:14| April the 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8714)|
| 2:25:17| 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8717)|
| 2:25:18| 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8718)|
| 2:25:19| Oh, the 22nd is health and obstetrics cleanup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8719)|
| 2:25:23| Okay, never mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8723)|
| 2:25:26| Yeah, next, now we're on to zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8726)|
| 2:25:31| Yeah, you don't need to read them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8731)|
| 2:25:34| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8734)|
| 2:25:37| So 59 is deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8737)|
| 2:25:40| Oh, it is, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8740)|
| 2:25:42| Item 6C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8742)|
| 2:25:44| Madam Chair, did you tell you we were in the small assembly next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8744)|
| 2:25:48| Yes, because it's Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8748)|
| 2:25:50| City Council will be in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8750)|
| 2:25:52| The city's in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8752)|
| 2:25:54| The county should take precedence and move them to the small assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8754)|
| 2:25:58| Yeah, good luck with that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8758)|
| 2:26:00| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8760)|
| 2:26:03| We should have had it in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8763)|
| 2:26:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8766)|
| 2:26:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8768)|
| 2:26:10| I mean, do I need to say it again as a reminder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8770)|
| 2:26:13| Because I'd already forgot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8773)|
| 2:26:16| We'll be in the small assembly on Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8776)|
| 2:26:19| But they also don't get the holiday on Monday, and we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8779)|
| 2:26:23| So there's the tradeoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8783)|
| 2:26:26| Except when you work for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8786)|
| 2:26:30| Item 6C is in District 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8790)|
| 2:26:33| Commissioner Lee, do you have anything to discuss regarding this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8793)|
| 2:26:36| I don't have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8796)|
| 2:26:38| I haven't got any emails on it, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8798)|
| 2:26:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8800)|
| 2:26:42| Item 61 in District 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8802)|
| 2:26:47| Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8807)|
| 2:26:50| This is one that I'm going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8810)|
| 2:26:53| I'm only comfortable with three dwelling units an acre on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8813)|
| 2:26:59| This is another Fox Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8819)|
| 2:27:01| So that's where my issue is on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8821)|
| 2:27:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8832)|
| 2:27:13| Item 62.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8833)|
| 2:27:15| Commission District 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8835)|
| 2:27:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8839)|
| 2:27:23| Numbers got changed a little bit here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8843)|
| 2:27:25| Let me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8845)|
| 2:27:28| This one bothers me because it was put on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8848)|
| 2:27:32| It wasn't even discussed at planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8852)|
| 2:27:36| Asking for up to five per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8856)|
| 2:27:39| And I would encourage you all between now and next week to pull up the map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8859)|
| 2:27:46| that is attached to the case review on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8866)|
| 2:27:53| It's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8873)|
| 2:27:56| I'm certain it probably wasn't given much attention because it faces shot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8876)|
| 2:28:00| road is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8880)|
| 2:28:04| Jim, are you still over there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8884)|
| 2:28:12| On subdivisions that are going to be facing shot road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8892)|
| 2:28:16| knowing that it's going to be the portion of shot road that is that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8896)|
| 2:28:21| going to be opened here in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8901)|
| 2:28:28| Is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8908)|
| 2:28:31| This one number 62 that I'm specifically referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8911)|
| 2:28:36| It doesn't look like there's any particular accommodation for it pulling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8916)|
| 2:28:39| in on and off of shot road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8919)|
| 2:28:42| There's not the this particular track going from memory from last month at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8922)|
| 2:28:48| commission or planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8928)|
| 2:28:50| It will be right in right out only shot roads going to have a median through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8930)|
| 2:28:54| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8934)|
| 2:28:55| And this particular site does not line up with a median opening and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8935)|
| 2:29:00| doesn't meet the spacing requirements for us to add water for them to add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8940)|
| 2:29:03| one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8943)|
| 2:29:04| So, yes, their access will be restricted to right in right out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8944)|
| 2:29:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8947)|
| 2:29:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8948)|
| 2:29:09| Do you anticipate just as that road is opened up and there's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8949)|
| 2:29:13| more traffic that will clearly be going faster that adding these additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8953)|
| 2:29:20| accesses to the subdivisions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8960)|
| 2:29:23| Is that going to be a problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8963)|
| 2:29:26| I mean, the road will be designed for I think the design speed out there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8966)|
| 2:29:30| forty five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8970)|
| 2:29:31| So I don't foresee any safety concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8971)|
| 2:29:34| I mean, we certainly wouldn't be very watchful of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8974)|
| 2:29:38| One of things we're also doing, there's another development on Bakertown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8978)|
| 2:29:42| We're making sure that those adjoining sites join each other as they come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8982)|
| 2:29:48| That way we have that cross connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8988)|
| 2:29:50| That way those folks can get to median openings over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8990)|
| 2:29:54| But this particular one, you're right, won't have that luxury until such time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8994)|
| 2:29:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=8999)|
| 2:30:00| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9000)|
| 2:30:01| Also, commissioners, if you take a special look at this, this five per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9001)|
| 2:30:07| and it says it's consistent with surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9007)|
| 2:30:15| There's maybe one small one that is five per acre around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9015)|
| 2:30:20| Everything else is, I think one was up to four and the rest of them were three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9020)|
| 2:30:26| So I just, I've not talked to anyone about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9026)|
| 2:30:31| It's just my own research on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9031)|
| 2:30:33| But I'm going to really be struggling at five per acre on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9033)|
| 2:30:40| Just giving you all a heads up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9040)|
| 2:30:47| The next one, item 63, Commission District 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9047)|
| 2:30:52| I haven't had any phone calls or emails on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9052)|
| 2:30:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9055)|
| 2:30:58| Next one, item 64, Commission District 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9058)|
| 2:31:00| Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9060)|
| 2:31:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9061)|
| 2:31:02| I'm sorry, Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9062)|
| 2:31:03| Can we go back to 63, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9063)|
| 2:31:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9065)|
| 2:31:07| So this one has a condition of a type B landscape screen, 20 feet on the PR sides of ag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9067)|
| 2:31:12| But I wanted to bring it to everyone's attention because if you read the description of the CB zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9072)|
| 2:31:21| it states that CB does have adverse impacts on surrounding properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9081)|
| 2:31:26| It goes on to say CB provides for a wide variety of business and manufacturing uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9086)|
| 2:31:31| The nature of such businesses is to attract large volumes of automobiles and truck traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9091)|
| 2:31:37| and to have adverse effects on surrounding properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9097)|
| 2:31:40| Hence, they are not properly associated with nor compatible with residential or institutional uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9100)|
| 2:31:46| or with other uses that require an environment free of noise, odor, and congestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9106)|
| 2:31:53| This was one that I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9113)|
| 2:31:55| We don't have anyone from planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9115)|
| 2:31:57| I don't know if neighborhood commercial zoning was considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9117)|
| 2:32:02| I think that it should be because it would require landscape and lighting design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9122)|
| 2:32:07| And so that's something that I would like for us to ask planning commission next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9127)|
| 2:32:13| because that's a little bit concerning to me when the zone actually states there will be adverse impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9133)|
| 2:32:22| We really need to take note of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9142)|
| 2:32:27| Thank you, Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9147)|
| 2:32:28| Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9148)|
| 2:32:29| Yeah, just to follow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9149)|
| 2:32:31| That is at the intersection of Dry Gap and Cunningham, East Beaver Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9151)|
| 2:32:38| They're starting housing right there all around, not only beside them and across the road also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9158)|
| 2:32:47| Commissioner Frazier suggested we need to make sure that there is some type of screening there, that's for sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9167)|
| 2:32:54| because there's going to be a lot of houses right there beside the PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9174)|
| 2:32:59| It says four units per acre, so I agree with Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9179)|
| 2:33:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9185)|
| 2:33:06| Is there any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9186)|
| 2:33:11| Seeing none, we'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9191)|
| 2:33:16| Commissioner Hill, District 6, item number 64.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9196)|
| 2:33:19| Yes, I am very glad to report on this one that it's a part of Knox Housing Partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9199)|
| 2:33:29| The proposal here is actually to continue on the back of already existing senior affordable housing, adding more units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9209)|
| 2:33:44| And it's just, if you all haven't been out and looked at what's already there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9224)|
| 2:33:51| there's a little one-bedroom, most of them, some of them are two-bedroom, all one level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9231)|
| 2:33:58| specifically affordable and low-income senior housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9238)|
| 2:34:04| The thing that makes me so excited about this is that their initial plan was to come in on this Claybury Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9244)|
| 2:34:15| which is one of the older housing areas in Carnes, and they were going to bring these units up through that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9255)|
| 2:34:26| They have since redesigned it and they're going to attach to the back of the existing senior housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9266)|
| 2:34:34| so it will not have a direct impact at all on Claybury Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9274)|
| 2:34:39| We had a great neighborhood meeting, and you can see that Knox Housing Partnership is asking for 12 per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9279)|
| 2:34:47| Commission approved 8 per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9287)|
| 2:34:52| The housing partnership actually said 10 was probably the best they could do, even if they were given 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9292)|
| 2:35:02| But having said that, the community is very agreeable to even approving up to the 12 per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9302)|
| 2:35:10| because of this huge concession that they're doing, basically keeping themselves self-contained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9310)|
| 2:35:16| And I will be supporting that recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9316)|
| 2:35:26| So that's my two cents on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9326)|
| 2:35:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9329)|
| 2:35:31| Next item is 65, Commission District 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9331)|
| 2:35:37| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9337)|
| 2:35:39| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9339)|
| 2:35:40| This is three in a row that I've had now in my district, a request for a sector plan amendment and a PR at 2 per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9340)|
| 2:35:53| But this one's kind of unique because it's only 1.7 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9353)|
| 2:35:57| I've not heard from Mr. Tchaikovsky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9357)|
| 2:35:59| He's not reached out to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9359)|
| 2:36:01| I wish he would because I'd kind of like to know what he wants to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9361)|
| 2:36:04| I mean, I think three houses is the most he could build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9364)|
| 2:36:07| Am I right, Commissioner Frazier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9367)|
| 2:36:09| Even if he got the 2 per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9369)|
| 2:36:11| I don't know if he's just wanting to build a house for his kids, or I don't know what his intent is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9371)|
| 2:36:17| There is a subdivision right next to it at 3 per acre that's been there for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9377)|
| 2:36:27| I don't have a problem depending on what his intent is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9387)|
| 2:36:31| I don't know why he needs 2 per acre on this 1.7 acre tract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9391)|
| 2:36:37| I'd like to hear from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9397)|
| 2:36:39| Commissioner Frazier, would you like to weigh in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9399)|
| 2:36:41| I would like to hear from planning staff on this one next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9401)|
| 2:36:45| This is one of those where we've gone back and forth with whether the growth policy plan stands or the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9405)|
| 2:36:53| The sector plan is actually the more current plan, and we've already established a precedent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9413)|
| 2:37:00| because we've referred to the sector plan for those other projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9420)|
| 2:37:05| Especially in the December meeting, we agreed to uphold the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9425)|
| 2:37:09| So that's something that the body needs to consider on this one, and we can ask staff on that Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9429)|
| 2:37:17| But I'm with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9437)|
| 2:37:18| I would like to know the intended use and how many houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9438)|
| 2:37:21| because there is a shared private drive there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9441)|
| 2:37:27| Commissioner Beeler, is that property to the north in a floodplain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9447)|
| 2:37:31| Is that what I'm looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9451)|
| 2:37:33| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9453)|
| 2:37:35| It's a creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9455)|
| 2:37:36| I believe it's Rosemary Creek that runs into the road there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9456)|
| 2:37:38| I could be wrong about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9458)|
| 2:37:39| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9459)|
| 2:37:44| Any more discussion on these two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9464)|
| 2:37:46| I guess 66 will lump with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9466)|
| 2:37:50| 67 is the same applicant, but in District 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9470)|
| 2:38:15| I'm good on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9495)|
| 2:38:17| I haven't heard anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9497)|
| 2:38:19| Doesn't seem like there's any kind of issues for this, so I think everything's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9499)|
| 2:38:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9506)|
| 2:38:27| And you're on the next one as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9507)|
| 2:38:29| 68.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9509)|
| 2:38:31| And I have actually spoke to this builder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9511)|
| 2:38:35| He actually is in my district, and it's totally consistent with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9515)|
| 2:38:41| And so we haven't had anybody complain about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9521)|
| 2:38:46| It definitely fits into Dutchtown Road area that he's going to be at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9526)|
| 2:38:50| So I'm good with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9530)|
| 2:38:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9533)|
| 2:38:55| Item 69.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9535)|
| 2:38:57| Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9537)|
| 2:38:58| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9538)|
| 2:38:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9539)|
| 2:39:00| Commissioner Oster, did he tell you this is a triangle-shaped lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9540)|
| 2:39:05| Did he tell you how many he wants to build?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9545)|
| 2:39:07| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9547)|
| 2:39:08| This is a triangle lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9548)|
| 2:39:10| It's not a square lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9550)|
| 2:39:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9551)|
| 2:39:12| It's triangle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9552)|
| 2:39:14| Is he going to ask for PR up to what was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9554)|
| 2:39:19| RA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9559)|
| 2:39:22| Has he asked for a total here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9562)|
| 2:39:24| We need to find out what he's going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9564)|
| 2:39:26| Yeah, it's five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9566)|
| 2:39:27| Five units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9567)|
| 2:39:28| It's a rectangular shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9568)|
| 2:39:30| Yeah, it's not a great-shaped lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9570)|
| 2:39:33| My biggest concern will be he's going to have to ask for some variance from BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9573)|
| 2:39:40| BZA, he cannot create his own variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9580)|
| 2:39:44| BZA needs to understand that he wants to build a house there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9584)|
| 2:39:48| and he goes for BZA to ask for setback variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9588)|
| 2:39:51| He can't have them because he's knowing what he's buying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9591)|
| 2:39:55| So check with that and see if there's going to be any variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9595)|
| 2:39:59| Right, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9599)|
| 2:40:01| It's in the urban growth area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9601)|
| 2:40:02| so right now you can only do one unit with a minimum of 10,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9602)|
| 2:40:08| unless it's permitted by review, and then you can do two at 12,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9608)|
| 2:40:14| So, yeah, he needs to be aware of what he can do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9614)|
| 2:40:17| Yeah, we'll talk again too this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9617)|
| 2:40:31| The next two are in Commission District 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9631)|
| 2:40:35| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9635)|
| 2:40:36| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9636)|
| 2:40:37| I had spoke to Mr. Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9637)|
| 2:40:41| He is the buyer of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9641)|
| 2:40:44| We had a discussion that I won't tell right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9644)|
| 2:40:47| He's checking into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9647)|
| 2:40:48| So it's the little piece of property there beside the waggles of John Spear Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9648)|
| 2:40:54| Mr. Snowden said that his road would have to come out to line up with the Fire Department Station 28,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9654)|
| 2:41:03| which will reduce his footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9663)|
| 2:41:05| With the 50-foot setback on the Governor John Spear scenic corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9665)|
| 2:41:10| that's going to cut it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9670)|
| 2:41:11| So he's asking for eight per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9671)|
| 2:41:15| It's four acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9675)|
| 2:41:16| I don't see him getting very many there at all if they follow the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9676)|
| 2:41:20| So we'll know next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9680)|
| 2:41:25| And you've got some good conditions there that were placed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9685)|
| 2:41:28| We just need to make sure that they're in the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9688)|
| 2:41:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9696)|
| 2:41:39| Next item, 71, Commission District 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9699)|
| 2:41:43| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9703)|
| 2:41:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9704)|
| 2:41:46| This is a small piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9706)|
| 2:41:48| It's 1.7 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9708)|
| 2:41:51| I have not spoke to Mr. Ferguson, but on the surface, I don't see any reason to not approve the RA request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9711)|
| 2:42:07| All right, moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9727)|
| 2:42:08| Item number 72, Commission District 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9728)|
| 2:42:14| I don't have any reason to not approve it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9734)|
| 2:42:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9737)|
| 2:42:20| 73 and 74, Commission District 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9740)|
| 2:42:25| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9745)|
| 2:42:28| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9748)|
| 2:42:30| I may get Commissioner Beeler to chime in on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9750)|
| 2:42:33| This is at the corner of John Spear and Strawberry Plains Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9753)|
| 2:42:36| It's the loco toco, soccer toco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9756)|
| 2:42:44| There's a loco toco out somewhere, anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9764)|
| 2:42:46| So, anyway, they're there, and they're doing a good business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9766)|
| 2:42:49| They've stayed in business, so that means it's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9769)|
| 2:42:53| It is in a floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9773)|
| 2:42:55| Right below this property is the soccer fields, and they flood a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9775)|
| 2:43:03| They're asking for some apartments on the backside, residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9783)|
| 2:43:09| That's probably the floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9789)|
| 2:43:11| We'll ask, next week, Mr. Snowden and Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9791)|
| 2:43:18| I do know the property across the road from the soccer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9798)|
| 2:43:23| They raised it, what, four feet, five feet, brought dirt in and raised it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9803)|
| 2:43:27| I mean, it's a big field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9807)|
| 2:43:29| It's not just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9809)|
| 2:43:30| It was a big field that they had to raise, put dirt in there for the flood zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9810)|
| 2:43:33| So, I consider this will be, I don't know how we'll go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9813)|
| 2:43:37| We'll just have to wait and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9817)|
| 2:43:38| But it is in a flood zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9818)|
| 2:43:44| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9824)|
| 2:43:46| Could I add something, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9826)|
| 2:43:47| Yes, Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9827)|
| 2:43:50| This is one of those, I don't know if you all check the public forum regularly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9830)|
| 2:43:54| but I had put something out there about just some observations of some zonings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9834)|
| 2:43:58| that I'm seeing become more frequently recommended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9838)|
| 2:44:02| and I encourage you all to just kind of take a look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9842)|
| 2:44:05| I just did a little kind of briefing on all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9845)|
| 2:44:08| But, like, for this one, it's recommended CA zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9848)|
| 2:44:12| and it doesn't have any lighting or landscape design standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9852)|
| 2:44:16| and it allows substantial signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9856)|
| 2:44:19| So, my question will be, on Tuesday, was neighborhood commercial considered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9859)|
| 2:44:25| And if not, why not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9865)|
| 2:44:29| Because, again, this allows for retail business and services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9869)|
| 2:44:34| not for manufacturing or processing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9874)|
| 2:44:37| And it's kind of an unusual piece of property where they're going into it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9877)|
| 2:44:41| with medium-density residential, light industry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9881)|
| 2:44:45| low-density residential, and stream protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9885)|
| 2:44:48| So, there's an approval for a portion of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9888)|
| 2:44:53| for general commercial and stream protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9893)|
| 2:44:57| and then another portion is approved for general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9897)|
| 2:45:02| So, it's kind of a tricky one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9902)|
| 2:45:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9911)|
| 2:45:14| The next one is Commission District 8, item number 75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9914)|
| 2:45:19| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9919)|
| 2:45:21| I have no issue with this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9921)|
| 2:45:23| This is RA that the applicant's asking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9923)|
| 2:45:26| the property across the street's RA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9926)|
| 2:45:29| This is the old part of the mascot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9929)|
| 2:45:31| A lot of this was housing for the mines years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9931)|
| 2:45:34| They're small lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9934)|
| 2:45:37| It doesn't look like it would be out of character with the area at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9937)|
| 2:45:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9941)|
| 2:45:43| Next one is, well, the next two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9943)|
| 2:45:47| Commission District 6, Commissioner Hill, 76 and 77.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9947)|
| 2:45:52| This applicant, who I've not spoken to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9952)|
| 2:45:59| is asking for a sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9959)|
| 2:46:01| as well as a change in zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9961)|
| 2:46:06| If you all have time, this is one that I do wish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9966)|
| 2:46:09| you would consider driving out to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9969)|
| 2:46:13| It's a little bit way out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9973)|
| 2:46:17| which if we're going to have homes is a good thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9977)|
| 2:46:20| but I can't imagine how they can even get three per acre on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9980)|
| 2:46:25| It lays pretty rough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9985)|
| 2:46:30| They'll have to definitely do a lot of clustering on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9990)|
| 2:46:37| And you just have to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=9997)|
| 2:46:43| I mean, it's just the top's beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10003)|
| 2:46:48| The rest of it, if you ask me, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10008)|
| 2:46:51| They're going to have to move a lot of dirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10011)|
| 2:46:53| I mean, a lot of dirt to develop this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10013)|
| 2:46:57| I think it's kind of a stretch myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10017)|
| 2:46:59| but him I'd be happy to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10019)|
| 2:47:02| Yeah, it's 67 acres and only 37 is really buildable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10022)|
| 2:47:06| so you're looking at a max density of 1.83, but it can be clustered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10026)|
| 2:47:11| One thing that stood out to me was in the traffic impact letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10031)|
| 2:47:15| It states that maintaining the same level of service is not likely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10035)|
| 2:47:20| and that's because the vehicle count was 1900.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10040)|
| 2:47:24| Yeah, and it's a far end of Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10044)|
| 2:47:27| It's narrow to lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10047)|
| 2:47:30| So you're going to look at more impact on your transportation network, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10050)|
| 2:47:35| Yeah, it'll be a mess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10055)|
| 2:47:42| Thank you, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10062)|
| 2:47:45| Next one is item number 78, Commission District 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10065)|
| 2:47:50| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10070)|
| 2:47:53| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10073)|
| 2:47:57| Oh, boy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10077)|
| 2:48:00| Looks like it's kind of just us, so I'll be real transparent about this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10080)|
| 2:48:05| This is an odd-shaped piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10085)|
| 2:48:07| It is at the corner of Midway Road and Thorn Grove Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10087)|
| 2:48:11| essentially down the street and across the street from the Midway Business Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10091)|
| 2:48:19| If you look at the lot, just please take note of everything that currently surrounds it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10099)|
| 2:48:27| It's all houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10107)|
| 2:48:30| The sector plan, I believe, has a commercial overlay on this entire little square here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10110)|
| 2:48:35| to the right of Midway Road, south of Thorn Grove Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10115)|
| 2:48:43| Guys, here's my issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10123)|
| 2:48:46| There's a business park sitting there on Midway Road with nothing in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10126)|
| 2:48:51| Now, I hope something ends up in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10131)|
| 2:48:54| I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10134)|
| 2:48:55| I hope it becomes a wonderful employment center for my district and for East Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10135)|
| 2:48:59| but until there's something in that park, I just have an issue with developing this residential area commercially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10139)|
| 2:49:07| It's a Dollar General, and I don't see how a Dollar General is going to attract something to that business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10147)|
| 2:49:18| I will tell you, there's something coming down the pike next month in this same area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10158)|
| 2:49:22| that's far less desirable than this Dollar General store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10162)|
| 2:49:27| Look, I think the neighborhood at this point, they sure don't want what they're going to be faced with next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10167)|
| 2:49:36| They're almost willing to concede this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10176)|
| 2:49:39| They don't really want this, and I can understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10179)|
| 2:49:44| My view is, until the park starts developing, let the place remain rural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10184)|
| 2:49:50| That's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10190)|
| 2:49:51| That's what the neighborhood wants it to stay until this business park starts getting tenants because it doesn't have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10191)|
| 2:49:58| So, I'm kind of hanging out on this one right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10198)|
| 2:50:03| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10203)|
| 2:50:05| I would support Commissioner Beeler on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10205)|
| 2:50:10| This parcel is unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10210)|
| 2:50:11| It's surrounded by ag on all three sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10211)|
| 2:50:15| The East Knox Community Plan was done in 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10215)|
| 2:50:19| It was totally disregarded at the Planning Commission level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10219)|
| 2:50:23| By ordinance, this zoning of CA, it must be in harmony with existing adjacent property uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10223)|
| 2:50:30| It's pretty clear that it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10230)|
| 2:50:35| Pretty clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10235)|
| 2:50:36| So, that's where I stand on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10236)|
| 2:50:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10242)|
| 2:50:43| I've not pulled this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10243)|
| 2:50:44| What's the size of the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10244)|
| 2:50:47| It's 5.7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10247)|
| 2:50:49| 5.37 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10249)|
| 2:50:53| It's an H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10253)|
| 2:50:55| It's shaped like an upside-down H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10255)|
| 2:51:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10263)|
| 2:51:04| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10264)|
| 2:51:06| And our last two are 79 and 80, Mission District 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10266)|
| 2:51:12| Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10272)|
| 2:51:14| I don't have any issue with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10274)|
| 2:51:17| I just have a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10277)|
| 2:51:19| So, Raccoon Valley Road, we're allowing commercial on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10279)|
| 2:51:23| And then this is now behind the commercial corridor where we're going to add more commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10283)|
| 2:51:30| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10290)|
| 2:51:33| Am I looking at this map correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10293)|
| 2:51:39| I mean, Raccoon Valley Road, we realize there's commercial enterprises along there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10299)|
| 2:51:46| But now we're going to what are the tracks behind the commercial to extend commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10306)|
| 2:51:55| Commissioner Frazier, am I looking at that the right way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10315)|
| 2:51:58| Or anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10318)|
| 2:52:01| Yeah, it states that it's a minor extension of the zone from the south of general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10321)|
| 2:52:07| It's half an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10327)|
| 2:52:08| It's in the plain growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10328)|
| 2:52:10| There is a blue line stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10330)|
| 2:52:13| Next to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10333)|
| 2:52:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10337)|
| 2:52:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10338)|
| 2:52:19| I mean, I've got some concerns about that stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10339)|
| 2:52:22| But it's pretty small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10342)|
| 2:52:27| I wouldn't – I think it's a stretch to say this is an extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10347)|
| 2:52:36| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10356)|
| 2:52:38| Madam Chair, are we about done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10358)|
| 2:52:41| It appears so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10361)|
| 2:52:43| We've got a pair of junior commissioner parents, I believe, I would guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10363)|
| 2:52:48| They're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10368)|
| 2:52:49| Well, they've been here the whole time, and I'm impressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10369)|
| 2:52:52| Are you bored or what is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10372)|
| 2:52:59| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10379)|
| 2:53:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10391)|
| 2:53:12| Is there – let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10392)|
| 2:53:14| No zoning appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10394)|
| 2:53:15| Any other business to come before Knox County Commission work session?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10395)|
| 2:53:20| I have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10400)|
| 2:53:22| We're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230213?start=10402)|
