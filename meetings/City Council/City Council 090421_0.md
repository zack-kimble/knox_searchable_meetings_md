| 0:04:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=240)|
| 0:04:01| Real quick on mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=241)|
| 0:04:02| First of all, you should have received at your place tonight a copy of Preservation 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=242)|
| 0:04:06| It's the annual report on historic preservation in Knoxville, which is prepared by the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=246)|
| 0:04:12| If you have any questions on that, you're welcome to contact either Ann Bennett or myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=252)|
| 0:04:17| But you can have that for your later perusal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=257)|
| 0:04:19| And if any member of the public would like that, we can make those available as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=259)|
| 0:04:23| Number two, Dogwood Arts Festival is obviously having an exceptional year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=263)|
| 0:04:27| We timed the blooms perfectly this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=267)|
| 0:04:30| So I know everybody's enjoying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=270)|
| 0:04:31| The festival itself has been great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=271)|
| 0:04:33| Just one reminder, while we're talking about festivals, the Rossini Festival is this Saturday downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=273)|
| 0:04:38| It's really one of the most fun events of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=278)|
| 0:04:42| So I encourage you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=282)|
| 0:04:43| I think it starts at noon and goes through, I think, nine o'clock this Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=283)|
| 0:04:48| Thursday, sundown continues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=288)|
| 0:04:51| Our third sundown will be this Thursday on Market Square, Tiny Universe, and Brent Thompson and his Wandering Circus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=291)|
| 0:04:57| Sir, you have that CD, don't you, Mr. Hall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=297)|
| 0:04:59| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=299)|
| 0:05:01| All the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=301)|
| 0:05:03| And actually, switching to a more serious note, if I could, I want to recognize some outstanding action on behalf of some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=303)|
| 0:05:13| citizens of our community and some employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=313)|
| 0:05:17| Not too long ago, some firefighters were dispatched to a very familiar location, 3724 Skyline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=317)|
| 0:05:23| Now, they'd been there before, but it had typically been for a medical emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=323)|
| 0:05:27| But on this particular morning, it wasn't a medical call that got their attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=327)|
| 0:05:32| It was an elderly couple who was asleep in the back of their house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=332)|
| 0:05:36| Charles Vandergriff and his wife, Sue, had been married for 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=336)|
| 0:05:39| What they didn't know is that in between them and the front door, their only means of egress was a fire in the kitchen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=339)|
| 0:05:46| And the fire was growing, and dark black smoke was starting to fill the whole house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=346)|
| 0:05:52| And forgive me if I pronounce the name wrong, but Sissy Mudda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=352)|
| 0:05:57| If Sissy's here, I hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=357)|
| 0:06:00| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=360)|
| 0:06:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=362)|
| 0:06:03| Well, anyway, I'll go ahead and tell the story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=363)|
| 0:06:04| We'll get her here to thank her later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=364)|
| 0:06:06| But Sissy is a Knoxville News Sentinel paper carrier working her route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=366)|
| 0:06:10| She noticed smoke coming from the house, called 911.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=370)|
| 0:06:13| After she first tried to wake the folks up and couldn't, she calls 911.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=373)|
| 0:06:17| Our firefighters, Sean Bradley and David Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=377)|
| 0:06:19| Are Sean and David here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=379)|
| 0:06:22| Dang, we're going to redo this because it's such a good story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=382)|
| 0:06:24| I want them to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=384)|
| 0:06:25| But anyway, I'll finish the story, and we'll present these to them in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=385)|
| 0:06:29| Sean and David made their way through the flames to the back room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=389)|
| 0:06:32| and the couple at this point was nearing unconsciousness, and they pulled them to safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=392)|
| 0:06:37| So a citizen doing a great job and two firefighters who responded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=397)|
| 0:06:40| So we'll get them back here to recognize them in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=400)|
| 0:06:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=405)|
| 0:06:46| Reports from members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=406)|
| 0:06:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=409)|
| 0:06:51| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=411)|
| 0:06:53| I think I've got four things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=413)|
| 0:06:57| First off, just want to remind everybody that the mayor's budget announcement is coming up May 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=417)|
| 0:07:02| It's a lunch that I think everybody's invited to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=422)|
| 0:07:06| I want to say a word about city council budget hearings, which will be happening on June 1st and May 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=426)|
| 0:07:14| Hopefully, within a few days, you'll get a draft agenda on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=434)|
| 0:07:17| We have to do a public hearing, or we are doing a public hearing, on June 1st at 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=437)|
| 0:07:25| Probably the way it's working out, we're not going to need that entire day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=445)|
| 0:07:29| My sense for planning is that we'll start later, that the time not with council will be early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=449)|
| 0:07:36| But I just want to give everybody an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=456)|
| 0:07:38| If you would rather have a break between the end of hearings and public hearing or a longer lunch or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=458)|
| 0:07:45| to let myself or Cindy know, and we can see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=465)|
| 0:07:49| That's where we're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=469)|
| 0:07:52| Third thing, wanted to just say a word about the convenience voting workshop, which is coming up on May 14th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=472)|
| 0:07:58| I don't have my calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=478)|

| 0:08:03| May 14th, 5 o'clock, a workshop here on convenience voting, which I think is a pretty significant change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=483)|
| 0:08:10| something that Knoxville will be potentially setting a precedent for the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=490)|
| 0:08:16| We're trying out something new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=496)|
| 0:08:18| I want to make sure everybody knows about that and ask folks, and I know some people here are doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=498)|
| 0:08:22| to make sure the public is aware of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=502)|
| 0:08:25| I think in fairness to the candidates who are going to be running in the fall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=505)|
| 0:08:28| I'd like to decide whether we're doing this or not before the filing deadline in the middle of June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=508)|
| 0:08:34| and that's not a lot of time for discussion on a public issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=514)|
| 0:08:38| So if people can share that, that'd be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=518)|
| 0:08:41| And the fourth piece, just want to remind everybody that May 9th is the softball tournament between city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=521)|

| 0:09:28| We're going to be recruiting some players, city employees, co-ed teams, so looking for players.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=568)|
| 0:09:34| And I can tell you, we're going to play smart and we're going to play hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=574)|
| 0:09:39| We have to play smart, because most of us can't play hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=579)|
| 0:09:42| A few of us can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=582)|

| 0:11:21| Do we have anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=681)|
| 0:11:22| Well, in a sure sign that the apocalypse is near, we have nobody signed up to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=682)|
| 0:11:27| We have people willing to if called on, but nobody signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=687)|
| 0:11:32| I think it might be good to hear from the speakers prior to our decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=692)|
| 0:11:36| Just one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=696)|
| 0:11:38| They have basically said they don't need to speak unless we want them to, unless they'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=698)|
| 0:11:42| If Dwayne or Arthur would you all like to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=702)|
| 0:11:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=706)|

| 0:11:49| Combined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=709)|
| 0:11:50| Mr. Mayor, Council, Dwayne Greave, 8 Embrey Place, Knoxville, president of Scenic Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=710)|
| 0:11:56| This will be our swan song tonight, so appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=716)|
| 0:12:01| Just wanted to go on record that Scenic Knoxville is, we do not object to the ordinance that has been revised a number of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=721)|
| 0:12:10| And for the record, a number of the board members have asked that we be sure to, again, go on the record that what we're looking at is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=730)|
| 0:12:18| directory sign that is 400 square feet, that the EMC is no larger than 250 square feet, and that the EMC will follow all the guidelines of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=738)|
| 0:12:24| the EMC operational requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=744)|
| 0:12:34| And it's not for advertising anything but the logos of the businesses that are in the city of Knoxville that are in Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=754)|
| 0:12:43| So we just want to make sure that that's on the record from Scenic Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=763)|
| 0:12:47| We'd also like to thank City Council for your vision of what our Scenic City can be and all that we've been through, through the what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=767)|
| 0:12:57| the last 16 or 17 council meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=777)|
| 0:13:01| And we appreciate the fact that you're accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=781)|
| 0:13:05| You've returned telephone calls, emails, and we appreciate all that as far as your work as a public service servant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=785)|
| 0:13:11| We'd also like to thank the codes department, and especially we want to thank Anita Cash for all that she has done in terms of also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=791)|
| 0:13:20| being available and accessible, and especially for her clarification of the codes and what she's done for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=800)|
| 0:13:26| She's truly a city servant and one that we all appreciate very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=806)|
| 0:13:33| Also, I'd like to thank Arthur and Robert for their openness and the ability to not only conference with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=813)|
| 0:13:41| and not compromise, but to keep an open dialogue through this whole process that we've been through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=821)|
| 0:13:47| And I'd like to close by just saying that I believe our city will be better off with the decisions that you, as City Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=827)|
| 0:13:53| have made on digital billboards and EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=833)|
| 0:13:57| We would like to put a word in that if, after things kind of calm down and we're all kind of tired of talking about signs and this sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=837)|
| 0:14:05| we're still interested in looking at the overall city in terms of what signage is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=845)|
| 0:14:10| And Scenic Knoxville would like to be a player at the table of that when we talk about the different areas in our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=850)|
| 0:14:16| and what we can do to clear up the mess that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=856)|
| 0:14:20| So, again, I want to thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=860)|
| 0:14:22| I also want to close by saying I'm certainly going to miss all of you on Tuesday evenings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=862)|
| 0:14:26| You know, if you need me, just call me and I'll be happy to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=866)|
| 0:14:30| But, again, thanks to all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=870)|
| 0:14:32| We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=872)|

| 0:14:42| We've gotten to know one another very well with phone conversations several times a week, meetings at least once a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=882)|
| 0:14:51| If this gets through on second reading, we are departing here for another meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=891)|
| 0:14:57| And we appreciate everything you all have done, your willingness to listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=897)|
| 0:15:05| One thing about local government, and I'll sit down, is that Council members are very accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=905)|
| 0:15:12| Every one of you has your telephone number in the phone book and are accessible to members of the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=912)|
| 0:15:19| And I would like to second what Duane has said about need of cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=919)|
| 0:15:24| She is a true resource, not only on this issue, but every issue that we deal with her department on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=924)|
| 0:15:32| She is, again, very helpful and we appreciate everything she's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=932)|
| 0:15:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=936)|

| 0:16:36| Debbie, you want to speak to that real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=996)|
| 0:16:38| Yes, Councilmembers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=998)|
| 0:16:40| This ordinance actually needs an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1000)|
| 0:16:42| What's before you was the proposed amendment that was in your packet last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1002)|
| 0:16:46| It's been revised in that Article 7 was pulled out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1006)|
| 0:16:50| This is a revamp of Article 4, Sections 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1010)|
| 0:16:55| And Code Studio has reviewed these sections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1015)|
| 0:16:59| And Mr. Wetzel is available to talk to you about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1019)|
| 0:17:03| But we need to have you technically amend this if you desire to pass it to adopt it as proposed in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1023)|

| 0:17:17| Ms. Pilow seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1037)|
| 0:17:19| Ms. Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1039)|
| 0:17:21| What was passed to approve are just the revisions of Article 4 but not Article 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1041)|
| 0:17:25| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1045)|
| 0:17:27| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1047)|
| 0:17:29| What was before you last August was Article 4, Sections 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 and Article 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1049)|
| 0:17:33| And Article 7 has been pulled out now because Code Studio, as that was the condition for it to be back before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1053)|
| 0:17:39| that Code Studio had reviewed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1059)|
| 0:17:41| And these are the sections that have been reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1061)|
| 0:17:43| And do we anticipate looking at a revision of Article 7 at some point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1063)|
| 0:17:49| I think Mr. Wetzel might want to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1069)|
| 0:17:51| The short answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1071)|
| 0:17:53| We're going to move to the Cumberland Avenue Code before we get back to Article 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1073)|
| 0:17:58| But as I told our committee working on it, we're probably going to have to drive right through Article 7| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1078)|
| 0:18:02| to get the form-based code for Cumberland Avenue where we want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1082)|
| 0:18:06| We're going to have to deal with who has authority and who has administrative responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1086)|
| 0:18:10| So we will be coming back to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| Because Articles, I mean, you know, it obviously read both items that were in our packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1092)|
| 0:18:16| And Article 7 makes a lot of sense, consolidating all those different boards and approval agencies into one place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1096)|
| 0:18:21| But if we're not there yet, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1101)|
| 0:18:23| It would require some stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1103)|
| 0:18:25| We think to clear up some of the internal discrepancies that have shown up in Article 7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1105)|
| 0:18:29| once you pull them all together, that it would take some material changes to the document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1109)|
| 0:18:34| which we promised we wouldn't do at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1114)|
| 0:18:36| So we'll wrap up this phase of it, bring you the form-based code on Cumberland hopefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1116)|
| 0:18:40| and sometime in this process bring you Article 7 as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1120)|
| 0:18:44| But if you'll remember, we got into this working on the form-based code on 7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1124)|
| 0:18:48| or the form-based code for Cumberland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| So does that help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| Yeah, very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1132)|
| 0:18:53| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1133)|
| 0:18:54| For Mrs. Poplin, I want to make sure I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1134)|
| 0:18:56| We have two things in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| The proposed amendment that is the more recent document is the one labeled proposed amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1138)|
| 0:19:05| as opposed to the one that is labeled revised and dated August 26, 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1145)|
| 0:19:12| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1152)|
| 0:19:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1153)|
| 0:19:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1154)|
| 0:19:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1155)|
| 0:19:16| If I could make one more comment, because I think this is going to pass like we did last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1156)|
| 0:19:19| We've had a committee working on this in city government for well over a year now to get this document in front of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1159)|
| 0:19:24| to work on Article 7 and to work on the form-based studio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1164)|
| 0:19:29| Steve King, Anita Cash, I'd say some good words about Anita, but she's already had enough tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1169)|
| 0:19:34| Mark Donaldson and Ann Wallace behind me have done a lot of staff work on this, lots of people from Steve's department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1174)|
| 0:19:41| from community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1181)|
| 0:19:42| David Massey's worked on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1182)|
| 0:19:43| We've had people from all over the city and NPC working to try to get this document where we want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1183)|
| 0:19:48| It's a good process that's going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1188)|
| 0:19:50| So I just want to thank these people publicly for their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1190)|
| 0:19:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1193)|
| 0:19:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1194)|
| 0:19:55| All those in favor of amending, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1195)|

| 0:19:59| Now all those in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1199)|
| 0:20:00| Any other discussion on the motion as amended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1200)|
| 0:20:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1203)|
| 0:20:04| All those in favor of the motion as amended, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1204)|

| 0:20:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1233)|
| 0:20:34| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1234)|
| 0:20:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1235)|
| 0:20:36| I was looking through all of the proposed rezonings that are in this plan and I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1236)|
| 0:20:43| my question for Mr. Donaldson is my understanding in reading this that the onus lies upon individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1243)|
| 0:20:50| council members or the city administration to enact the proposed rezonings that are in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1250)|
| 0:20:56| this one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1256)|
| 0:20:57| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1257)|
| 0:20:58| In addition to the council and the administration, the planning commission itself can initiate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1258)|
| 0:21:04| them but given that the council has final approval authority on any zonings, it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1264)|
| 0:21:11| be ideal to have them initiated here and allow the MPC then to carry through on the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1271)|
| 0:21:19| I meant to go back through and look at last year's one-year plan and I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1279)|
| 0:21:23| I mean obviously a lot of time and study goes into creating this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1283)|
| 0:21:26| Do you have any idea what percent of the recommended rezonings actually occur in any given year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1286)|
| 0:21:32| and if they don't, are they rolled forward to the next one-year plan update?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1292)|
| 0:21:38| Generally a very small percentage of the rezonings identified in the plan get carried forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1298)|
| 0:21:45| to action and yes, they do get then rolled forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1305)|
| 0:21:49| The list at the end of the plan grows with each version of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1309)|
| 0:21:57| Some councils have been in the past have been more aggressive about rezoning to come into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1317)|
| 0:22:01| compliance with the plans that have been adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1321)|
| 0:22:06| Some planning commissions have been more aggressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1326)|
| 0:22:10| Over time, the path of least resistance has been to ignore them and just allow them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1330)|
| 0:22:16| happen on an applicant-initiated basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1336)|
| 0:22:20| I guess my issue is we have this mandated document and this mandated work that happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1340)|
| 0:22:26| on an annual basis and I hate to see make work with no outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1346)|
| 0:22:32| We just addressed an issue with a parcel of property that probably should have been rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1352)|
| 0:22:38| years ago in Beer Board and it would seem that if these recommendations come before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1358)|
| 0:22:45| us and MPC and the administration as a body, that there ought to be some impetus to act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1365)|
| 0:22:52| on them, either up or down, but at least to consider them rather than just letting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1372)|
| 0:22:58| them roll forward and letting the list at the back of this book continue to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1378)|
| 0:23:06| I would just make an observation that it is so helpful that MPC offers an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1386)|
| 0:23:13| when the sector plans are reviewed for the 1, 5, 15-year plans for citizen participation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1393)|
| 0:23:21| and I know that is the time when, over the years, I've become personally involved, just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1401)|
| 0:23:28| as a citizen and now as a council member, to be able to participate in looking at those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1408)|
| 0:23:34| plans before they are completed and become a part of this document that council approves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1414)|
| 0:23:41| It's very important and I think the neighborhood groups in many areas really take very seriously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1421)|
| 0:23:47| the opportunity to participate in that and out of that comes a lot of recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1427)|
| 0:23:53| I think, Mr. Donaldson, to pursue some of those changes and I thought this year, particularly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1433)|
| 0:24:00| there were a number of recommendations that came out of the sector plan meeting that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| attended, which involved the district, of course, that I represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1445)|
| 0:24:10| And it was an opportunity for just that, for many people to voice an interest in moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1450)|
| 0:24:16| forward with some of these rezonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1456)|
| 0:24:19| And then there's also the flip of the coin where people say, uh-oh, not here, not us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1459)|
| 0:24:26| So it's a participatory process, but by the time it gets to us, it does seem cut and dried,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1466)|
| 0:24:34| I think, and it does, you know, maybe we don't have that broad discussion that we have of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1474)|
| 0:24:39| carrying forward with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1479)|
| 0:24:41| But it certainly beats the days when we had no planning agency here and when we had absolutely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1481)|
| 0:24:49| no plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1489)|
| 0:24:51| So I have to say the process is certainly an improvement over what it was, gosh, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1491)|
| 0:24:57| in the 70s when some of us got very involved in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1497)|
| 0:25:01| And I particularly like the public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1501)|
| 0:25:05| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1505)|
| 0:25:07| Well, I think Ms. Roddy raises a great question about moving forward on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1507)|
| 0:25:11| And Mr. Donaldson, the proper way for us to move forward would be a resolution to y'all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1511)|
| 0:25:17| asking to implement these changes, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1517)|
| 0:25:20| And could we actually do something that would say, hey, why don't you just do all of these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1520)|
| 0:25:24| Would that feel like just, you know, way too much work or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1524)|
| 0:25:31| That would be way too much work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1531)|
| 0:25:35| If we could prioritize and assemble a list of particular rezonings that you want to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1535)|
| 0:25:44| after during a particular year, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1544)|
| 0:25:48| And we can incorporate it into our work program before we get started in the next fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1548)|
| 0:25:54| But, you know, some of these, the reason that the rezonings have slowed down is because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1554)|
| 0:26:01| some of them become very, very controversial and it pits neighbors against neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1561)|
| 0:26:05| And it just became the path of least resistance to not do them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1565)|
| 0:26:13| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1573)|
| 0:26:17| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1579)|

| 0:26:47| Mr. Becker, I understand that you have spoken to folks in the neighborhood about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1607)|
| 0:26:53| And looking at this plan amendment and also at the corresponding rezoning on our next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1613)|
| 0:26:59| agenda item, this is asking for an O1, an office, right in the middle of an R2 district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1619)|
| 0:27:07| a residential district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1627)|
| 0:27:09| And I guess when you look at the zoning maps in terms of the larger picture of that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1629)|
| 0:27:15| it just doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1635)|
| 0:27:17| So I need some help understanding why you and the neighborhood are comfortable with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1637)|
| 0:27:21| going forward with this, because it just really looks just like spot zoning, which is usually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1641)|
| 0:27:25| something this council tries not to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1645)|
| 0:27:27| I think there are a couple of things to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1647)|
| 0:27:31| One, this has always been an office building, had been for years, and has been unoccupied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1651)|
| 0:27:37| for about a year and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1657)|
| 0:27:39| It is an office building look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| I mean, if you've driven by, this is an office building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1661)|
| 0:27:43| It's not, I mean, it's feasible to convert this into apartments, but it's a difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1663)|
| 0:27:49| conversion to move it into apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1669)|
| 0:27:52| The bigger piece is, again, you know, we've heard lots of times Mr. Donaldson talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1672)|
| 0:27:58| a scale of use and that office and high-density residential are similar in the traffic generation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1678)|
| 0:28:08| in the use, that they tend to have a similar, and Mr. Donaldson can probably say this better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1688)|
| 0:28:18| than I can, but a similar impact on the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1698)|
| 0:28:22| So at some level, excuse me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| Well, this is R2, which is apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1706)|
| 0:28:29| Yes, we call it our standard residential zone, but it's apartment zoning, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1709)|
| 0:28:33| I mean, it's where all the apartments are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| And if you look around in that area, it's all apartments, which is part of why we did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1716)|
| 0:28:41| the request for a down zoning to get back to an R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1721)|
| 0:28:44| The other thing you've got here is a growth happening down Inskip Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1724)|
| 0:28:51| It's the bigger worry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| The spot zoning is less of a worry there than the development that's currently happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1733)|
| 0:29:00| A lot of interest, as I spoke about, a small area plan at the last meeting to deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1740)|
| 0:29:05| these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1745)|
| 0:29:06| This developer is involved in that process, wants to move forward with the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1746)|
| 0:29:10| on the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1750)|
| 0:29:11| And it feels like the area along Inskip, some of it we would love to keep as single family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1751)|
| 0:29:17| houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1757)|
| 0:29:18| And it's possible that some will stay in the center of Inskip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1758)|
| 0:29:22| There are single family houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| They're all zoned R2 now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| Some of them will work better as offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| It's part of, again, some of the thinking we have about the R4 zone, where you get places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1768)|
| 0:29:34| on a busy road that don't work as single family, as residences, because they're on a busy road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1774)|
| 0:29:39| They work well as offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1779)|
| 0:29:42| So this is one that the neighborhood feels good about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1782)|
| 0:29:47| The developers involved and the problems with the area that folks want to deal with are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1787)|
| 0:29:52| on a bigger scale than this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1792)|
| 0:29:56| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1798)|
| 0:29:59| Ready to vote then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1799)|

| 0:30:36| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1836)|
| 0:30:37| Let me just, Ms. Roddy, again, I think you could ask a similar question on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1837)|
| 0:30:43| This is one in particular where the R4 zoning would sort of be perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1843)|
| 0:30:49| This is an area where the, and fortunately the applicant here plans to keep the look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1849)|
| 0:30:54| of a house and just use it as an office space, and would have applied, I know Mr. Seymour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1854)|
| 0:31:01| was here, whose worked with the applicant, would actually love for this to be an R4 zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1861)|
| 0:31:05| as opposed to an office zone, but we've not finished the R4 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1865)|
| 0:31:09| It's still under review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1869)|
| 0:31:11| The developer needed to move forward, and we're doing this in this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1871)|
| 0:31:15| So, there's some good questions with this as well, that a new zoning would be perfect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1875)|
| 0:31:22| for, and I'm very much looking forward to have that new tool in our belt for this particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1882)|
| 0:31:27| kind of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1887)|
| 0:31:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| Mr. Donaldson, the applicant asked for a change from R1 to O1, and you have the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1893)|
| 0:31:40| and then the MPC subsequently approved O3, which is office park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1900)|
| 0:31:44| On a small parcel like this, in the middle of residential, why do they need office park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1904)|
| 0:31:50| I don't see anything in the description of office park that fits this parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1910)|
| 0:31:54| It's come to be preferred because of the greater setbacks and some plan review that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1914)|
| 0:32:03| occurs with any development, so that it works as a buffer against that neighborhood to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1923)|
| 0:32:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1932)|
| 0:32:13| So, the planning commission feels like the office park gives a greater level of protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1933)|
| 0:32:17| to the surrounding neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1937)|
| 0:32:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1938)|
| 0:32:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1939)|
| 0:32:20| Thanks for clarifying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1940)|
| 0:32:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=1941)|

| 0:38:03| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2283)|
| 0:38:04| I'd be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2284)|
| 0:38:05| I sent you an email this afternoon about 3 o'clock responding to an email that you had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2285)|
| 0:38:10| sent to Ms. O'Hara regarding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| I didn't receive that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2292)|
| 0:38:14| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2294)|
| 0:38:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2295)|
| 0:38:16| We had only nine people attended the public hearing for both of these proposals, and there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2296)|
| 0:38:21| was no opposition to including Walter P. Taylor or Eastport School or the small area around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2301)|
| 0:38:27| Williams Creek in the five-point redevelopment area, and there was very little discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2307)|
| 0:38:32| regarding the two documents, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2312)|
| 0:38:34| After I discussed each one, there were two absentee property owners in attendance that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2314)|
| 0:38:39| wanted to know if their property was scheduled to be acquired, and I responded no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2319)|
| 0:38:44| We had no plans to acquire any occupied property or any tenant-occupied property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2324)|
| 0:38:50| And I said we would only acquire unoccupied dwellings if we were able to secure a HOPE| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2330)|
| 0:38:58| 6 application for Walter P. Taylor that would necessitate the displacement of some tenants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2338)|
| 0:39:04| but into other facilities that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2344)|
| 0:39:07| But no one objected to our plans for future development regarding either one of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2347)|
| 0:39:13| plans, the housing plan or the amendment to the existing five-points redevelopment plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2353)|
| 0:39:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2360)|
| 0:39:21| And this question actually applies to 11L, the next item on the agenda, but since we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2361)|
| 0:39:24| kind of discussing them in conjunction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2364)|
| 0:39:26| So there was no concern about the addition of the property acquisition ability to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2366)|
| 0:39:32| five-points plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2372)|
| 0:39:33| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2373)|
| 0:39:34| No mention to that at all, other than that one question asked by an absentee owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2374)|
| 0:39:40| And you anticipate that that would only be used within the Walter P. Taylor development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2380)|
| 0:39:44| or perhaps also on adjacent areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| No, it would be used in adjacent areas, anywhere within the five-points redevelopment area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2386)|
| 0:39:52| because over time things have changed with regard to dilapidated properties or particularly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2392)|
| 0:40:00| along the Williams Creek area where there are vacant lots that use it as dumping ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2400)|
| 0:40:04| That's a very low area right in there that needs to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2404)|
| 0:40:08| So that's why that small area over there on the east end was added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2408)|
| 0:40:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2412)|
| 0:40:13| And all those acquisitions then come before us as part of that process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2413)|
| 0:40:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2418)|
| 0:40:19| If you approve the amendment to the plan, you would be authorizing those acquisitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2419)|
| 0:40:24| But you have not targeted which specific properties you might need to acquire?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2424)|
| 0:40:29| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2429)|
| 0:40:30| That would come from the city administration directing us to acquire any particular property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2430)|
| 0:40:35| We don't make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2435)|
| 0:40:37| But that, again, doesn't come back in front of us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2437)|
| 0:40:40| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2440)|

| 0:42:00| 11P is the resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Knox County to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2520)|

| 0:42:10| and Urban Development to Knox County under the Community Development Block Grant Program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2530)|
| 0:42:14| to be used for the renovation of the building located at 447 North Broadway known as Menvilla| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2534)|
| 0:42:20| Manor, a permanent supportive housing facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2540)|
| 0:42:22| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2542)|
| 0:42:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2543)|
| 0:42:24| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2544)|
| 0:42:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2545)|
| 0:42:26| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2546)|
| 0:42:27| Oh, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2547)|
| 0:42:28| I didn't see that light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2548)|
| 0:42:29| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2549)|
| 0:42:30| Let me back up and I'll take that motion off the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2550)|
| 0:42:34| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2556)|
| 0:42:37| I'll just make some brief comments on this and the other related items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2557)|
| 0:42:40| As I talked to Mr. Lawler today who, for those who didn't know, completed his 15th Boston| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2560)|
| 0:42:45| Marathon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2565)|
| 0:42:46| I don't think I could drive that far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2566)|
| 0:42:48| He didn't finish in the top 1%, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2568)|
| 0:42:52| You know, he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2572)|
| 0:42:54| Okay, first, this project is certainly laudable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2574)|
| 0:42:59| Preserving these buildings is laudable as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2579)|
| 0:43:04| When we recently had something come up related to this, you know, we talked about the fiscal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2584)|
| 0:43:10| conservative in me takes some issue with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2590)|
| 0:43:14| This is something, depending on who you hear from, costs about $200 a square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2594)|
| 0:43:19| Well, I pulled, now this is before the county reassessed property, but according to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2599)|
| 0:43:24| last census, the median value of a home in Knox County is $98,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2604)|
| 0:43:32| That was the last census.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2612)|
| 0:43:34| And what is being contemplated here is something that's going to be approximately 40% more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2614)|
| 0:43:40| expensive than this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2620)|
| 0:43:43| My issue is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| We have limited resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2625)|
| 0:43:48| We have a large nut to crack, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2628)|
| 0:43:54| I would respectfully submit that there are properties available for sale right now, less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2634)|
| 0:44:01| expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2641)|
| 0:44:02| We are approximately three years into this, and it hopefully will be done December 31st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2642)|
| 0:44:08| 2010, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2648)|
| 0:44:12| We have the opportunity, I believe, to serve more people for less money in a quicker period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2652)|
| 0:44:22| of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2662)|
| 0:44:23| I know one of the arguments is that this project, being the historic renovation, is in line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2663)|
| 0:44:30| with what has been done elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2670)|
| 0:44:32| That's all well and good, but that doesn't mean it needs to be done here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2672)|
| 0:44:37| If we're able to find something better, quicker, less expensive, that can serve more people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2677)|
| 0:44:45| I think that's what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2687)|
| 0:44:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2691)|
| 0:44:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2694)|
| 0:44:55| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2697)|
| 0:44:58| I'm going to give John a chance to answer those questions, if you can remember them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2698)|
| 0:45:02| There were quite a number of statements made there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| Lesser, better, quicker, more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2704)|
| 0:45:08| Good evening, first of all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| John Lawler, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2710)|
| 0:45:15| It's an interesting question, but the truth is the funds we're talking about from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2715)|
| 0:45:21| city represent about 20 percent of the development cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2721)|
| 0:45:26| The county's funds that we're talking about represent 2 or 3 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2726)|
| 0:45:30| The remainder of funding sources are funding sources that will only go to this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2730)|
| 0:45:37| So if we were to do something like pull away from the project and say take the funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2737)|
| 0:45:41| we're talking about tonight and take it elsewhere, you're taking approximately 75 percent of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2741)|
| 0:45:47| the $7 million project cost and just taking it off the board, which would be a real waste| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2747)|
| 0:45:53| when the developers spent the blood, sweat and tears to bring it to the table so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2753)|
| 0:45:59| this transaction could be consummated once we have the vote tonight, if it's successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2759)|
| 0:46:05| So it's an interesting thought that, well, you could take this money and do a lot with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2765)|
| 0:46:11| somewhere else, but the truth is 75 percent of the money, a little more than that, is not portable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2771)|
| 0:46:19| I had one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2779)|
| 0:46:20| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2780)|
| 0:46:21| Someone wanted me to ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2781)|
| 0:46:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2782)|
| 0:46:23| If the rebid isn't even in, how do you know you need the money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2783)|
| 0:46:28| Well, we know that, of course, for those of you that may not be familiar, because of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2788)|
| 0:46:35| use of some of the funds that are being contemplated, the general contractor had to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2795)|
| 0:46:40| re-procured, if there's such a term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2800)|
| 0:46:43| The general contractor had already been procured through a competitive bid process and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2803)|
| 0:46:48| lowest bidder was selected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2808)|
| 0:46:51| That person and others have come forward and said they'd like to be considered through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2811)|
| 0:46:56| this RFP process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2816)|
| 0:46:57| We know that the number is going to be at least what the low bid general contractor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2817)|
| 0:47:03| gave us, and so you know you're going to need that much at least to complete the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2823)|
| 0:47:10| So if it's a $4.5 million hard cost plus contingency, you're definitely going to need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2830)|
| 0:47:17| this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2837)|
| 0:47:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2838)|
| 0:47:19| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2839)|

| 0:47:27| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2847)|
| 0:47:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090421?start=2848)|
