| 2:45:01| Crews entered the building quickly, extinguishing the fire and preventing what could have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=9901)|
| 2:45:06| a very costly day for Knox County schools. We want to take this opportunity to remind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=9906)|
| 2:45:12| County Commission that rural metro fire provides service to Knox County owned properties without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=9912)|
| 2:45:18| cost to Knox County. We would ask that you take this as an opportunity to endorse our memberships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=9918)|
| 2:45:25| and our membership efforts in your districts so that we can continue to provide these services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=9925)|
| 2:45:31| Always know that we are here and open for questions or inquiries that you may have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=9931)|
| 2:45:36| and I'll entertain any questions. Thank you, Mr. Bagwell. Are there any questions for Mr. Bagwell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=9936)|
| 2:45:46| Okay, seeing none. Thank you very much. Thank you. Okay, Madam Clerk, let's see. Next item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=9946)|
| 2:45:55| this will be public forum. These are for agenda items. So we have six speakers on public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=9955)|
| 2:46:03| tonight. And let's see, I will call out the first four names just to get everybody ready. It's Julie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=9963)|
| 2:46:11| Gautreaux, Eric Glutton, Mike Hammond, and Margaret Held, if you all kind of get ready. Our first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=9971)|
| 2:46:17| speaker is Julie Gautreaux. Are you with us, Julie? Or do you have anyone in the room? Jacob?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=9977)|
| 2:46:27| Yes, sir. I know I'm late and I apologize, but I believe all of these are on item 25, the jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=9987)|
| 2:46:37| Yes, sir. We wait till then and go ahead and do business till then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=9997)|
| 2:46:41| because we're going to start asking questions about 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=10001)|
| 2:46:45| I think if Mr. Lutton and Mr. Hammond, who are both Knox County employees, want to hold their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=10005)|
| 2:46:50| comments till the end, until that item comes up, then I think that would be more than appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=10010)|
| 2:46:55| But given that I'm not sure what everybody's timeline is for other speakers, I'd go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=10015)|
| 2:47:04| with the public if those two gentlemen would hold tight for the item, because I imagine some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=10024)|
| 2:47:09| questions will be more pointed towards that. I think if Mr. Lutton and Mr. Hammond, who are both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=10029)|
| 2:47:14| Knox County. Is there anybody? Yes, Mr. Chairman, it's Mike Hammond. I'm very willing to wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=10034)|
| 2:47:20| Okay. Does that work out for everybody? Okay. I'll look for Ms. Julie Gautreaux. Are you with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=10040)|
| 2:47:28| Please make yourself known. Going once, twice. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=10048)|
| 2:47:33| I'm here. Can you hear me? Oh, you're here. Yes. If you could turn your camera on, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=10053)|
| 2:47:39| I'm trying to do that, but it's not quite working for me tonight. Can I still talk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=10059)|
| 2:47:45| Yes, we'll go ahead. If you could please state your name and your county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=10065)|
| 2:47:49| of residence, and you have five minutes to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=10069)|
| 2:47:52| Thank you very much, Commissioner. Hold on one second. Do we have a timer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=10072)|
| 2:47:56| I know you may not be able to see it, but Jacob| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=10076)|
| 2:48:03| or Knox County IT team? I timed myself at three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=10083)|
| 2:48:09| Okay. All right. We have a timer for you. All right. Ms. Gautreaux, you have five minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=10089)|
| 2:48:15| to address commission. State your name and county of residence, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=10095)|
| 2:48:19| Thank you, Commissioner and members of the county commission. My name is Julie Gautreaux. I live at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=10099)|
| 2:48:24| 313 Woodland Trace Drive in Farragut. I understand that the proposed inmate calling solutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=10104)|
| 2:48:31| contract is on consent tonight, but I want to make the commission and the public aware of some local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=10111)|
| 2:48:38| history around this issue. I've been a public defender for 30 years, and I remember when the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=10118)|
| 2:48:44| Roger D. Williams Detention Facility was built back in 92. It was designed for in-person visitation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=10124)|
| 2:48:51| for prisoners and their families. Millions of county dollars were spent on its construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=10131)|
| 2:48:57| In 2014, Sheriff Jones proposed a contract with Securus Technologies to install video| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=10137)|
| 2:49:03| visitation and other tech services, and that made sense. Times are changing. New technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=10143)|
| 2:49:09| presents new methods of communication. It's a great option for folks who can't visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=10149)|
| 2:49:15| But after the commission approved that contract, the sheriff eliminated the in-person option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=10155)|
| 2:49:21| that the Roger D. Williams facility was designed for. Every so-called security-based justification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=10161)|
| 2:49:28| for this policy has been debunked by their own records that were obtained via open records in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=10168)|
| 2:49:34| 2018. The reason for the termination of in-person was financial incentive. Incarcerated people or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=10174)|
| 2:49:42| their families have to pay for remote visitation. The tech was installed at no cost to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=10182)|
| 2:49:48| The sheriff didn't have the hassle of staffing on-site visitation, and the county got a 50| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=10188)|
| 2:49:53| percent commission off the monies being paid to Securus by the families. Now Sheriff Spangler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=10193)|
| 2:50:00| has presented a deal with ICS with an even better percentage. I understand it's 88 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=10200)|
| 2:50:07| ICS can afford it. Their parent company, the Keith Group, made billions of dollars off prison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=10207)|
| 2:50:14| commissary deals where people are charged up to four dollars for a packet of beef jerky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=10214)|
| 2:50:19| When people are in jail, their families, most of them poor, will scrape together what they have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=10219)|
| 2:50:25| make life more comfortable for their incarcerated loved ones, even when they know they're getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=10225)|
| 2:50:30| fleeced. The Keith Group is managed by HIG Capital, a private equity firm that recognizes how much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=10230)|
| 2:50:38| money can be made off people who are trapped and their families. It's a predatory enterprise worth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=10238)|
| 2:50:44| billions of dollars to people with no connection to Knox County. If you think this moral compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=10244)|
| 2:50:50| is okay because the people being exploited are, quote, just inmates, please remember the vast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=10250)|
| 2:50:57| majority of people in local custody are pretrial, not convicted of anything, and those who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=10257)|
| 2:51:03| are misdemeanor offenders. Your 88 percent will be coming off the backs of struggling Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=10263)|
| 2:51:09| families, spending the pennies they have to stay in contact with their loved ones in jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=10269)|
| 2:51:15| during some of the most difficult times since the Great Depression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=10275)|
| 2:51:19| I'm realistic about the fact that tech is here, but other states and jurisdictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=10279)|
| 2:51:24| even in conservative states like Texas, have made laws that require the option of in-person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=10284)|
| 2:51:29| visitation where video technology has been adopted. I hope some of you will visit the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=10289)|
| 2:51:35| detention facility one day, have a look at the tens of thousands of unused square feet that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=10295)|
| 2:51:40| were laid out specifically for on-site visitation in 1992, perhaps before your next review of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=10300)|
| 2:51:48| contract like this or before the construction of expensive new space for remote courtrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=10308)|

| 3:26:32| I'm going to give you both, you and Mr. Hammond, five minutes each as we did in public forum. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12392)|
| 3:26:40| Mr. Lutton, if you would please state your name and your department in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12400)|
| 3:26:44| and you have five minutes to address Commission, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12404)|
| 3:26:47| My name is Eric Lutton. I'm the Knox County Public Defender. I largely kind of presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12407)|
| 3:26:53| my issues last week. I wanted to sign up to speak again this week for a couple of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12413)|
| 3:26:58| One, I was asked a question last Tuesday when I spoke by one of the commissioners about whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12418)|
| 3:27:05| or not I agreed with the $100,000 savings number that it would, that this proposed facility would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12425)|
| 3:27:13| supposedly save the taxpayers each year. And at that time, I had not heard that number. That was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12433)|
| 3:27:17| the, you know, I was learning that for the first time, and so I was not able to intelligently speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12437)|
| 3:27:21| to that. And since I had been asked that question, I wanted to try and look into that a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12441)|
| 3:27:26| so I could provide an answer from a perspective of someone who's working in the court system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12446)|
| 3:27:31| And I think that that number, if the information I've gotten is correct, then I would dispute that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12451)|
| 3:27:36| number. What I have been told by a third party where that number is coming from is that currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12456)|
| 3:27:44| the Sheriff's Department spends about $135,000 a year in fuel costs in their transportation division,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12464)|
| 3:27:50| and that the estimate is that roughly 65 to 70 percent of those fuel costs that are spent each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12470)|
| 3:27:56| year are for transportation of inmates back and forth from the Roger E. Wilson Detention Facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12476)|
| 3:28:00| and the city county building, which does come out to about $100,000. But I think it's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12480)|
| 3:28:06| to note, as this is looked at from a financial perspective, that this facility being built would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12486)|
| 3:28:12| not mean that individuals would not be going to court anymore. It doesn't cut the transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12492)|
| 3:28:17| costs from everybody going all the way down to nobody going. It would, under Rule 43, would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12497)|
| 3:28:23| potentially result in some additional arraignments being conducted out of the detention facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12503)|
| 3:28:31| And then, of course, if there was a change in Rule 43, which I know was mentioned as a possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12511)|
| 3:28:36| that some people are moving for that at a statewide level, however, if that rule were to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12516)|
| 3:28:42| be changed, we, one, would have no idea what it would look like. But, two, under the Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12522)|
| 3:28:46| Constitution, there's only so much they could tweak the rule, because there's plenty of case law on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12526)|
| 3:28:52| point about the individual, about the fact that somebody has a right to confront their accuser| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12532)|
| 3:28:58| face to face. So I think any time you were having any sort of a hearing where witnesses were present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12538)|
| 3:29:02| there's no way to modify the rule where that's not the case. So I still think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12542)|
| 3:29:05| you're talking about the vast majority of individuals would still be being transported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12545)|
| 3:29:10| And so I think that if the information that I've gotten is accurate, then I think that $100,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12550)|
| 3:29:16| would be significantly, significantly smaller than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12556)|
| 3:29:21| The only other thing that I wanted to speak to, I had gotten a question from a commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12561)|
| 3:29:26| that perhaps I did not do a very good job of explaining something last week. And so I wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12566)|
| 3:29:31| to talk about how there's sometimes a benefit to the taxpayers that individuals are brought to court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12571)|
| 3:29:39| specifically on those low-level misdemeanors. Basically, what happens, like, let's say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12579)|
| 3:29:43| you have somebody arrested for public intoxication on Saturday night, and the magistrate decides not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12583)|
| 3:29:47| to release them. That individual, as it would stand outside of COVID times, would be brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12587)|
| 3:29:55| to misdemeanor court for their arraignment on that, typically on that Monday in court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12595)|
| 3:29:59| where a plea offer would be presented, and they would have the option to typically accept a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12599)|
| 3:30:04| time-served offer, which gets them out of custody. If they were to modify Rule 43 to allow pleas to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12604)|
| 3:30:10| take place, I'm sorry, as it currently stands, you cannot take pleas remotely except for under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12610)|
| 3:30:18| the current Supreme Court COVID order. That's the only reason we're able to take pleas remotely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12618)|
| 3:30:21| currently. So what I think would end up happening is you'd have this very large number of category| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12621)|
| 3:30:27| clients that are charged with low-level misdemeanors that are getting out when they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12627)|
| 3:30:31| having their initial appearance in court, or rather their arraignment in court, that if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12631)|
| 3:30:35| were to not transport those individuals, what happens is you don't transport them Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12635)|
| 3:30:39| but then you're going to have to transport them Tuesday or Wednesday, and the taxpayers are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12639)|
| 3:30:43| to eat that $70-some a day that they're going to sit in custody for longer. And so you've not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12643)|
| 3:30:50| eliminated the transportation. You have just moved it a day or two. And those were the issues that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12650)|
| 3:30:56| wanted to speak. I wanted to try and answer the question that was posed to me last week and try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12656)|
| 3:30:59| and provide a better explanation of what I was trying to say last week on the misdemeanor pleas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12659)|
| 3:31:04| but then also wanted to make myself available in case anyone had any questions for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12664)|
| 3:31:07| MR. LUTTON. Thank you, Mr. Lutton. If you'll kind of hang in the on-deck circle here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12667)|
| 3:31:14| if there are questions, we will get to those. Well, we could actually, if there's any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12674)|
| 3:31:20| for Mr. Lutton, we could actually address those now. I think he'll stay with us through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12680)|
| 3:31:24| conversation. But is there any questions immediately from any commissioners before I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12684)|
| 3:31:29| go to Mr. Hammond? I'm not seeing any hands up. So hang with us, Mr. Lutton. And Mr. Hammond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12689)|
| 3:31:38| if you would please state your name and your department, and you have five minutes to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12698)|
| 3:31:42| commission. MR. HAMMOND. Thank you. I'm Mike Hammond, Knox County Criminal Court Clerk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12702)|
| 3:31:45| 400 Main Street, number 149. I've made some notes. I'm going to be referring to my notes here as I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12705)|
| 3:31:51| give you some information. As you know, I sent you an email last week which outlined a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12711)|
| 3:31:56| things, and I don't want to go into all of that again because I'm sure that you have read that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12716)|
| 3:32:01| and you kind of have a good feel for what we were trying to portray to you in terms of numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12721)|
| 3:32:07| both for juvenile, for the magistrates, what is happening in some other states, and what is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12727)|
| 3:32:12| on in Chattanooga. They already have a video courtroom for each of their criminal divisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12732)|
| 3:32:17| and they've had it even before the pandemic. But I would like to call attention to one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12737)|
| 3:32:21| the things that was in that email, and that is from the Supreme Court rule on February 12th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12741)|
| 3:32:28| 21, which paragraph 7, which said, judges are charged with the responsibility of ensuring that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12748)|
| 3:32:34| core constitutional functions and rights are protected. Now, having a video courtroom is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12754)|
| 3:32:39| not going to change that. It is up to the judges to make sure that the rights are protected. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12759)|
| 3:32:45| today, I sent you an email from the three criminal judges and the five General Sessions judges. They| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12765)|
| 3:32:53| all signed it, and I would call your attention to a couple of paragraphs there, which I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12773)|
| 3:32:58| are extremely important. They go to say that there are certain types of court appearances that will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12778)|
| 3:33:03| always require that the defendant appear in the courtroom in person. Yes, you do have a right to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12783)|
| 3:33:09| face your accuser. Children are not involved in this. They're out of the juvenile facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12789)|
| 3:33:13| and they're right next door to the courtroom. So children are an entirely different type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12793)|
| 3:33:18| situation. However, this email goes on to say, however, it's estimated that thousands of inmates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12798)|
| 3:33:25| every year are scheduled for appearances in Knox County Court that can easily be done over a video| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12805)|
| 3:33:31| link with the court in accordance with the law and the Constitution. We're talking about administrative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12811)|
| 3:33:37| type hearings, arraignments, those types of things. Yes, you have a right to face your accuser. There| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12817)|
| 3:33:43| will be many instances where people will be brought to court, and we will have trials and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12823)|
| 3:33:47| hearings. Now, this email goes on to say, in order to facilitate timely video appearances and clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12827)|
| 3:33:53| communication, I want to mention clear communication because, as I mentioned last time, Judge Irwin's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12833)|
| 3:33:58| been doing this for two years. And what they do is they take a laptop, they take it into the pod,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12838)|
| 3:34:04| and they try to communicate via Skype. And so you've got noise, you've got people yelling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12844)|
| 3:34:08| you've got all kinds of noise. It's not very conducive to conducting a hearing. So these folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12848)|
| 3:34:13| have an opportunity and should have an opportunity to have a quiet place where they can communicate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12853)|
| 3:34:19| with the folks who are doing this video arraignment. And the same thing goes with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12859)|
| 3:34:23| magistrates. And so it goes on to say, clear communication between the defendant and his or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12863)|
| 3:34:28| her attorney. The proposed video facility at the Knox County Detention Facility is a necessity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12868)|
| 3:34:35| Such a resource will be used well beyond the end of the pandemic. So they're on record as saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12875)|
| 3:34:41| that it's going to be used beyond the pandemic. Let me mention a couple of other things. And I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12881)|
| 3:34:46| was pleased to hear Mrs. Hill say that her clients have gone to the Family Justice Center. I'm the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12886)|
| 3:34:51| board president of the Family Justice Center, and I'm glad to hear her say that people are being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12891)|
| 3:34:55| served there and receiving the services that they need. Funding for the Family Justice Center has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12895)|
| 3:35:00| not been cut by Knox County or the city of Knoxville, both which provide funding. Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12900)|
| 3:35:05| County takes care of the building. And if there's anything that goes wrong with that building, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12905)|
| 3:35:09| call Knox County, they come and fix it. And the city of Knoxville has not cut their funding as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12909)|
| 3:35:13| well. I'd also like to say that I sat in your seat for a number of years, and I'm glad that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12913)|
| 3:35:19| you all are there now instead of me. I'm enjoying the job that I have. I cannot tell you the number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12919)|
| 3:35:24| of times that we as a commission were threatened with lawsuits. And so I know that you were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12924)|
| 3:35:29| threatened with lawsuits here today. I will tell you again, the judges have said their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12929)|
| 3:35:34| responsibility is to make sure that constitutional rights are protected. They have put that in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12934)|
| 3:35:40| writing for you. And so I guess that what I would like to do is just close by saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12940)|
| 3:35:46| you have your juvenile court judge in favor, your magistrates are in favor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12946)|
| 3:35:51| you have your three criminal judges that are in favor, calling it a necessity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12951)|
| 3:35:56| Five sessions judges are in favor, your criminal court clerk is in favor. I would add this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12956)|
| 3:36:01| I talked with Judge McMillan in Fourth Circuit on Friday. He says that they bring in about 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12961)|
| 3:36:06| to 50 inmates per month. By having this would help him, he actually has to fight for time now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12966)|
| 3:36:11| because I believe we have two cameras out there now. I'm talking about six video courtrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12971)|
| 3:36:15| which is going to help expedite things a lot. There's no question that this is going to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12975)|
| 3:36:20| savings. But my point is, we're elected officials too. And so it's our responsibility to come to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12980)|
| 3:36:26| and say, we believe we have an efficient means that's going to help the process that is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12986)|
| 3:36:32| to be a long term, something that will be learned going on long term, even past the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12992)|
| 3:36:38| And so we answer the taxpayers just like you do. And so we're here asking you for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=12998)|
| 3:36:42| because as the judges said, we believe it's a necessity. And I'm not sure how much time I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13002)|
| 3:36:47| left. Do I have about a minute, Mr. Chairman? You don't, but I'll go ahead and give you one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13007)|
| 3:36:51| because I imagine there'll be some questions. And then I am going to get to one of our public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13011)|
| 3:36:56| speakers that was in the forum. But go ahead and wrap it up, Mr. Chairman. My last minute is this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13016)|
| 3:37:02| how did this all come about? I think that's important. We have been having meetings for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13022)|
| 3:37:06| several months of what we call the stakeholders. That's the judges, that's the DA, public bar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13026)|
| 3:37:12| the public defender, the clerks, the sheriff's office. We've been having meetings for months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13032)|
| 3:37:19| And this issue of not having the ability to do remote hearings has been brought up several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13039)|
| 3:37:25| And so three to four months ago, it was brought up that, can we do something? Is there something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13045)|
| 3:37:30| we can do to help provide a better means of communication, a better means of having these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13050)|
| 3:37:35| remote hearings? And so at that point, the sheriff came back with a proposal and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13055)|
| 3:37:40| I believe we can build a facility at the detention center. And at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13060)|
| 3:37:44| the stakeholder said, let's go for it and let's see if we can do this. And so that's how it all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13064)|
| 3:37:50| came about. It wasn't something that just came up last week or last month. This is something we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13070)|
| 3:37:55| been talking about for several weeks. And so that's why we're presenting it to you now. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13075)|
| 3:38:00| really feel that this is something that will be helpful in the future. And Mr. Jay, let me also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13080)|
| 3:38:05| mention one other thing. I have my chief deputy Richard Major here. I'm not a lawyer. He can get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13085)|
| 3:38:10| into the weeds and answer any questions that you might have in the weeds. And so I just wanted you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13090)|
| 3:38:14| to know that he is available to do that. But thank you so much for giving me the chance to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13094)|
| 3:38:17| CHAIR BAILET Thank you very much, Mr. Hammond. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13097)|
| 3:38:21| stand by with your team. I'm going to, before we open up for more conversation amongst the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13101)|
| 3:38:26| commissioners, I'm going to call on our last public forum member who had this as an item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13106)|
| 3:38:31| We had a little technical difficulty. So we're going to try one last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13111)|
| 3:38:34| Calling Sarah McDonald. And if she is... MR. MCDONALD I just spoke with her a few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13114)|
| 3:38:38| moments ago. And she was having technical difficulties. And she...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13118)|
| 3:38:41| CHAIR BAILET Okay. Well, we tried three times. So...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13121)|

| 3:38:47| CHAIR BAILET Let's see if we can get her in. And if so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13127)|
| 3:38:49| we'll hear from her. And we will then proceed. Ms. McDonald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13129)|
| 3:38:55| Ms. McDonald, are you with us? I believe... Oh, there you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13135)|

| 3:39:28| CHAIR BAILET You have five minutes. And I will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13168)|
| 3:39:30| give you a warning with one minute left. MS. MCDONALD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13170)|
| 3:39:33| Awesome. Thank you. Okay. Well, I am Sarah McDonald. I am in Knox County. And obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13173)|

| 3:39:48| which is why I am opposing this measure. Public is a wide range of abilities. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13188)|
| 3:39:57| although I'm generally a competent person, being a survivor of domestic abuse has left me in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13197)|
| 3:40:05| situation where I am unable to access what would be normal Internet, normal communications for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13205)|

| 3:40:45| I'm sorry, Ms. McDonald, that the technical difficulties are not going to allow us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13245)|
| 3:40:49| hear from you. So, Jacob, if you would maybe just remove that. We'll start by opening up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13249)|
| 3:40:55| the questions. I see Commissioner Daley first, and then Commissioner Biggs, if you would. Go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13255)|
| 3:41:02| ahead, Mr. Daley. MR. DALEY| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13262)|
| 3:41:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to give the opportunity to Sheriff Spangler and our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13264)|
| 3:41:09| Law Department to make any comments on the speakers and especially the Sheriff. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13269)|
| 3:41:16| I'll turn it over to you, Mr. Chairman. CHAIR BAILET| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13276)|
| 3:41:20| Okay. Commissioner, Sheriff Spangler, are you with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13280)|
| 3:41:23| MR. SPANGLER I am, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13283)|
| 3:41:26| CHAIR BAILET If you would just identify yourself and go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13286)|
| 3:41:30| MR. SPANGLER I'm Spangler, North County Sheriff, 400 Main Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13290)|
| 3:41:33| I'm not sure where to start other than maybe I can clarify some things. I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13293)|
| 3:41:40| obviously the bus that's sitting on top of me is pretty heavy right now. I say that in a joking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13300)|
| 3:41:45| manner, but I'm also serious about the fact that I think that with what was going on, I think when I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13305)|
| 3:41:52| presented this to the stakeholders, I thought maybe this was a good idea, and I still think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13312)|
| 3:41:58| it's a great idea. But I guess I'm the mouthpiece for the whole group, if you will. But this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13318)|
| 3:42:08| commission will make their decision on how they feel things are going. I am for this. I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13328)|
| 3:42:15| that there are some questions, and I understand that people have some concerns about it. But I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13335)|
| 3:42:22| don't think that it seems like we jumped into this. But as Mr. Hammond said, we've been talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13342)|
| 3:42:27| about this for quite some time. And maybe I should have come up with it a long time ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13347)|
| 3:42:32| but I guess my slowness or whatever you want to call it just didn't catch on. And when I proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13352)|
| 3:42:38| that this could possibly happen out there, I was looking for a remedy for all of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13358)|
| 3:42:46| This is a minimal, if you will, for the Knox County Sheriff's Office. I'm not standing up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13366)|
| 3:42:52| advocating this just for the Sheriff's Office. There is no way that I would come to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13372)|
| 3:42:56| commission and ask them for $1.5 million for something I think that would be fruitless. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13376)|
| 3:43:01| I think I've told you all that from the very beginning. This is something that came from a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13381)|
| 3:43:06| group. And here I am as the mouthpiece for it. And I think Mike Hammond put it very eloquently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13386)|
| 3:43:14| This is something that is definitely needed. Now, you've got both sides. There's always two sides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13394)|
| 3:43:21| of the story. And you're going to hear both sides, and you've heard both sides. And that's for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13401)|
| 3:43:26| all to determine how you want to go with it. I think what it does, it does help within us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13406)|
| 3:43:32| bringing people. Mr. Hammond mentioned in that memo, yeah, the judges are going to be the ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13412)|
| 3:43:38| who decide how much they use this. That will be up to them. Now, some of the question was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13418)|
| 3:43:44| is it going to be used after the pandemic? From what I hear from several of the judges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13424)|
| 3:43:49| they absolutely want to do that. And that's great. Some judges may say, well, we want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13429)|
| 3:43:54| have more hearings back downtown. Yeah, that's going to reduce if we have the hearings at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13434)|
| 3:44:00| facility, in this new facility, then yeah, that's going to cut back on some of our trips or quite a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13440)|
| 3:44:06| bit of our trips. Because what's going to be heard, 65% of the cases that are going to be heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13446)|
| 3:44:12| virtually by video arraignment is going to be arraignments and plea deals. It's not going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13452)|
| 3:44:17| be trials. They're not going to do trials on the internet, period. That's not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13457)|
| 3:44:22| So I think there's a misconception there. So we just want to make sure that that's clear too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13462)|
| 3:44:29| I'm not sure what questions that I will have towards me. I think the majority of them may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13469)|
| 3:44:34| come from Mr. Hammond, or at least towards him and Mr. Major and him being the attorney. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13474)|
| 3:44:42| like Mr. Hammond said, I'm sure anytime you get threatened with a lawsuit, and trust me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13482)|
| 3:44:47| I'm on the receiving end of many lawsuits right now just because of being the sheriff and you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13487)|
| 3:44:51| running the jail. Those happen on a daily basis. And the judges would not sign off on something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13491)|
| 3:44:58| that they thought that they were violating somebody's rights of any kind. I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13498)|
| 3:45:02| that that's ever going to happen. So trust in me when I say that, look, this is something that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13502)|
| 3:45:09| think that it's beneficial for all of Knox County. I'm not coming to you as a sheriff saying the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13509)|
| 3:45:14| sheriff's office, just the sheriff's office needs this. No, I'm not. I'm not doing that. I'm doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13514)|
| 3:45:19| this and I'm being the mouthpiece for all of the stakeholders that are involved in this. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13519)|
| 3:45:25| like I said, that bus sitting on my chest right now is pretty heavy. So I'll leave it at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13525)|
| 3:45:29| CHAIRMAN HICKS Thank you, Sheriff Spangler. Commissioner Daley, you still have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13529)|
| 3:45:34| And you have the mute button to hit as well. COMMISSIONER DALEY| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13534)|
| 3:45:38| I apologize. I hate Zoom meetings. Hey, Sheriff, have you talked to the sheriff of Hamilton County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13538)|
| 3:45:46| and got any information back from him how they've been doing Video Corps for a couple of years now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13546)|
| 3:45:52| SHERIFF SPANGLER As a matter of fact, I was at the Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13552)|
| 3:45:54| Sheriff's Association last week with Paul asking. Yes, I did talk to him about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13554)|
| 3:45:59| It's going very well for them. They've been using it quite some time. And as I mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13559)|
| 3:46:04| and as you said, we don't do any of them on trial. We don't do that. Obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13564)|
| 3:46:10| you can't do that. We're not going to take away the rights of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13570)|
| 3:46:13| I think part of what also this does, and I don't mean to get away from your question there. I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13573)|
| 3:46:19| I'm rambling a little bit. But what it does too, is it gets those individuals back out of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13579)|
| 3:46:24| facility quicker and gets them back to their families if that's where they're going. They're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13584)|
| 3:46:29| not having to be brought down here for that hearing or that plea deal, taken back to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13589)|
| 3:46:33| facility and then brought back to the city county building to be released because that's the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13593)|
| 3:46:37| it's supposed to go. So it does help on transporting that and getting those individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13597)|
| 3:46:44| back to their families and getting them out of the facility. When they come downtown to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13604)|
| 3:46:48| facility as well, there is what we call the slam. And that's where the inmates are held until they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13608)|
| 3:46:54| are heard. And you talk about lawsuits, that's one coming right there. Too many people in one area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13614)|
| 3:47:01| and we have to be able to keep them confined in one area and to be able to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13621)|
| 3:47:06| security is handled just as well. So, but yes, he's very happy the way things have been going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13626)|
| 3:47:12| CHAIRPERSON WEEKS Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13632)|
| 3:47:14| COMMISSIONER HICKS Thank you. Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13634)|
| 3:47:16| COMMISSIONER BIGGS Thank you, Chairman Jay. I have a few questions. Number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13636)|
| 3:47:22| I was reading the resolution that's attached, and it's not the new resolution that we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13642)|
| 3:47:27| presented last week. CHAIRPERSON WEEKS The resolution caption that was read and is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13647)|
| 3:47:35| attached, you're saying is not the same one that was sent out on Friday afternoon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13655)|
| 3:47:40| COMMISSIONER HICKS Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13660)|
| 3:47:41| CHAIRPERSON WEEKS What is the difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13661)|
| 3:47:43| COMMISSIONER HICKS Hang on, I'll read it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13663)|
| 3:47:47| CHAIRPERSON WEEKS It was one sent out for commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13667)|
| 3:47:51| it looks like 422 on Friday by Drusilla.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13671)|
| 3:47:54| COMMISSIONER HICKS Yes, sir. The one that's attached to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13674)|
| 3:48:00| agenda that doesn't speak anything about the second whereas where it states that the facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13680)|
| 3:48:06| wouldn't be used for any other purpose other than virtual meetings or virtual court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13686)|
| 3:48:11| CHAIRPERSON WEEKS You're saying it doesn't have a whereas or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13691)|
| 3:48:21| that states that? I know that's stated in the email. Is that, are you saying that you're looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13701)|
| 3:48:27| for a whereas in the language? I'm sorry to, I just want to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13707)|
| 3:48:32| COMMISSIONER HICKS Yeah, I guess it was a friendly amendment for the new resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13712)|
| 3:48:36| but it's not on this language that we have attached to our working agenda. So, is this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13716)|
| 3:48:42| the one that we're specifically voting on, or is it the new resolution, I guess, is my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13722)|
| 3:48:48| CHAIRPERSON WEEKS It would be the new one that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13728)|
| 3:48:53| was emailed out on Friday. If it's not attached here, let's get that attached real quick. If this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13733)|
| 3:48:58| is not the exact same one, I'm sorry, we just had, it looks like a clear, I'm getting a note from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13738)|
| 3:49:05| Drew that says she's attaching it now, so. COMMISSIONER HICKS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13745)|
| 3:49:08| I'll go ahead with mine. CHAIRPERSON WEEKS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13748)|
| 3:49:10| Let's continue the kind of, I'll come back. Do you have additional questions while we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13750)|
| 3:49:14| COMMISSIONER HICKS Yeah. My second question was, I was trying to look through all the data that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13754)|
| 3:49:20| we were provided that talks about maybe technical difficulties. You know, I mean, it's been stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13760)|
| 3:49:25| tonight, you know, we don't really overly care for all the things that's going on. And this isn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13765)|
| 3:49:33| going to be managed by Knox County IT, I would imagine, so it'll be managed by the Sheriff's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13773)|
| 3:49:38| Department IT. Is that something as well as, I was kind of hoping that I would see something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13778)|
| 3:49:44| that states how many prisoners we had let out during the COVID and how that went, as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13784)|
| 3:49:51| where the numbers are at the current moment. And do we expect those numbers to accelerate and come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13791)|
| 3:49:56| back into where they were pre-COVID numbers? COMMISSIONER HICKS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13796)|
| 3:50:03| I'm not sure where to start by answering that, Commissioner Biggs. What I will tell you is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13803)|
| 3:50:07| we've got over 2,600 on pretrial right now, which means those are the people who, whenever they come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13807)|
| 3:50:14| in, they spend enough time in there to be booked and they're back out of our facility. Before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13814)|
| 3:50:20| COVID hit, you had our facility out there, you're looking at times anywhere from 1,200 to 1,300| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13820)|
| 3:50:26| inmates, and we're down to, I believe it is, 900, maybe 800 right now with that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13826)|
| 3:50:34| I think you heard last week, or at least last month, from Mr. Hammond saying that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13834)|
| 3:50:38| 18,000 cases now because of COVID that are backed up. So that's going to take some time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13838)|
| 3:50:46| and who knows how long that's going to be. So that's what I have for you right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13846)|
| 3:50:54| COMMISSIONER BIGGS Thank you, Sheriff. Is there anybody from IT that could answer my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13854)|
| 3:50:59| technical difficulties problem? COMMISSIONER HICKS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13859)|
| 3:51:02| Can you restate that question real quick? COMMISSIONER BIGGS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13862)|
| 3:51:04| So just like, you know, tonight, people having technical difficulties coming in through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13864)|
| 3:51:09| lines and things of that nature and video feed, I was just wanting to see, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13869)|
| 3:51:14| where are we at? Is that going to be an additional IT cost, things of that nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13874)|
| 3:51:19| like once this is established? ZACH WEBB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13879)|
| 3:51:25| Oh, I can speak to what I know, if that's okay. COMMISSIONER HICKS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13885)|
| 3:51:27| If you could just identify yourself and your department, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13887)|
| 3:51:29| ZACH WEBB Zach Webb, Knox County IT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13889)|
| 3:51:32| So my understanding is that that entire operation will be handled by the Sheriff's IT side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13892)|
| 3:51:37| Now, that said, we'll be interfacing with courtrooms at the CCB that is handled by Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13897)|
| 3:51:43| County IT proper, if that makes sense. So it's kind of two. We're already doing it now. This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13903)|
| 3:51:48| is just an expanded facility to do the same. COMMISSIONER HICKS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13908)|
| 3:51:51| Yeah. The main reason, Mr. Webb, is I was just kind of wondering, you know, what happens if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13911)|
| 3:51:58| the feed's messed up? Does that backlog us even more with courts and things of that nature? And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13918)|
| 3:52:02| just kind of make sure that we're not going to have a huge area where kinks are going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13922)|
| 3:52:07| placed in there for us. ZACH WEBB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13927)|
| 3:52:09| Yeah. I think from our side, from the courtroom side, the management in the CCB and the areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13929)|
| 3:52:14| here, no, because we already have that planned for and we're already covered and we're doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13934)|
| 3:52:20| I would ask, you know, the Sheriff to, you know, Aaron Arnell and the people on his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13940)|
| 3:52:25| side to speak to their need. But as far as my side goes, we're covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13945)|
| 3:52:29| COMMISSIONER HICKS Okay. So also, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13949)|
| 3:52:32| I know sometimes people break into meetings and things of that nature. We've seen it multiple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13952)|
| 3:52:36| times through Zoom conference calls throughout. Is that also going to be protected by the Sheriff's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13956)|
| 3:52:41| Office so things of that nature don't happen in the middle of court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13961)|
| 3:52:44| ZACH WEBB So the meeting itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13964)|
| 3:52:46| is handled on the courtroom side, unless that's changed on the back end. We use a secure internal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13966)|
| 3:52:50| platform for that. They're not public meetings like these Zoom meetings are. The links, you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13970)|
| 3:52:56| secured through our multi-factor authentication on the back end. Mr. Chairman, if I might,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13976)|
| 3:53:02| if I might inject here on Mr. Biggs, Richard Major is here and he works very closely with IT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13982)|
| 3:53:07| on putting all this together. If it's appropriate, I'd like for him to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13987)|
| 3:53:10| COMMISSIONER HICKS Sure. Go ahead. If you could identify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13990)|
| 3:53:12| yourself and your department, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13992)|
| 3:53:14| RICHARD MAJOR Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Richard Major| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13994)|
| 3:53:19| from Knox County. I currently serve as Magistrate and Administrator for the Criminal Courts. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=13999)|
| 3:53:25| one of my interesting jobs that we've taken on in the last year was working with Zach Webb's folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14005)|
| 3:53:30| to set up the video court process that has been developed over the last year. And first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14010)|
| 3:53:35| I'd like to say that you cannot say enough good about Knox County IT and the hard work they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14015)|
| 3:53:42| done in supporting the courts as we've begun to roll this process out over these last many months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14022)|
| 3:53:48| To Commissioner Biggs' question a moment ago as to how the process is working and how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14028)|
| 3:53:56| individuals may break into a meeting, the Knox County Criminal Courts have been doing the vast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14036)|
| 3:54:00| majority of their work by video through Microsoft Teams for most of the last nine months. I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14040)|
| 3:54:07| participated in, I wouldn't say the majority of, but a great number of those conferences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14047)|
| 3:54:12| specifically I've administered many of them. And I am unaware of any case of anyone breaking into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14052)|
| 3:54:17| a meeting who was not invited. The way that structure works is we set up a team. That team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14057)|
| 3:54:24| is limited to the members that the court administrator or secretary allows into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14064)|
| 3:54:29| meeting. That's usually a specific number of lawyers, in addition to a specific number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14069)|
| 3:54:34| users at the jail, as well as the judges. You have to be a member to be allowed into the meeting. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14074)|
| 3:54:41| that's how we control who gets in and who does not get in. Thank you, Mr. Major. I will also note| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14081)|
| 3:54:48| that the revised resolution has been uploaded to the online agenda. And that is live now for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14088)|
| 3:54:56| your review. Moving down the list, Mr. Smith, you have the floor. I believe, well, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14096)|
| 3:55:07| Ward's hand is up before mine, but if he's okay, I'll go ahead. Sorry, I didn't, I mean, I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14107)|
| 3:55:13| got him as I saw him. So go ahead. You can go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14113)|
| 3:55:18| First question I have is, do we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14118)|
| 3:55:24| change our motion to reflect this resolution that does have the language in it in the second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14124)|
| 3:55:31| whereas, as opposed to what is on the floor, on the floor was the resolution off of the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14131)|
| 3:55:40| Just a technical question there. Second, I wanted to ask Director Caldwell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14140)|
| 3:55:51| one of our public speakers referenced our financial situation. In it, she said that we were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14151)|
| 3:55:58| I believe, a couple million dollars behind on revenues. I want you to address that, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14158)|
| 3:56:07| Thank you, Commissioner Smith. As we discussed at Finance Committee last week in the documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14167)|
| 3:56:15| that you all received, and we went over at Chairman's briefing as well, our revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14175)|
| 3:56:20| in the general fund are $5.3 million higher through December than they were last December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14180)|
| 3:56:26| Our expenses are about the same. Local option sales tax is at 4 percent over our five-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14186)|
| 3:56:34| average through that same time frame. Property tax is up 6 percent over our five-year average| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14194)|
| 3:56:40| through that same time frame. So we are trending well above what we had budgeted for in revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14200)|
| 3:56:49| I would tell you sales tax will probably get in more than $25 million more than what was budgeted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14209)|
| 3:56:56| for, including schools. Of course, and then the bulk of that goes to schools. But no, from a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14216)|
| 3:57:02| financial standpoint, we are nowhere near a deficit. We are in great financial shape,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14222)|
| 3:57:09| and we most definitely, as we sit here today, will have a budget surplus to end the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14229)|
| 3:57:16| So to be perfectly clear, nothing will be cut for this capital to do this capital project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14236)|
| 3:57:22| Nothing will be cut, and I would go back to what Mr. Hammond said. I don't know where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14242)|
| 3:57:29| information came from about cutting of the Family Justice Center. That is not true. We own the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14249)|
| 3:57:34| building that the Family Justice Center is in, and we pay for that operations about $150,000 annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14254)|
| 3:57:43| And so last year, as we did the budget process, if you'll recall, we really didn't make drastic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14263)|
| 3:57:52| cuts. We just reduced it to reflect what we were being told from our peers in the state as to what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14272)|
| 3:57:58| we could expect in revenue. CHAIR BAILET Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14278)|
| 3:58:02| COMMISSIONER DALEY Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14282)|
| 3:58:03| CHAIR BAILET Thank you, Commissioner Smith. Back to your first question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14283)|
| 3:58:08| I think the what you might be doing is offering a friendly amendment to Commissioner Daley that he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14288)|
| 3:58:15| his motion be to approve the revised resolution. Is that accurate? Is that okay with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14295)|
| 3:58:21| Commissioner Daley? COMMISSIONER DALEY| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14301)|
| 3:58:22| It is. CHAIR BAILET| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14302)|
| 3:58:23| And Commissioner Smith has a second on that. You're okay with that as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14303)|
| 3:58:26| COMMISSIONER DALEY Okay. We'll take that. Commissioner Ward, you're up next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14306)|
| 3:58:32| COMMISSIONER WARD Thank you. I have two clarifying questions and then one actual question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14312)|
| 3:58:38| just so that I make sure I understand. If any inmate requests to have an in-person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14318)|
| 3:58:44| court hearing, they can have an in-person court hearing, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14324)|
| 3:58:46| COMMISSIONER DALEY| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14326)|
| 3:58:51| Who wants to answer that one? COMMISSIONER DALEY| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14331)|
| 3:58:54| If the judge wants to provide that, yes. So, they would make their appeal to the judge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14334)|
| 3:58:58| and the judge would make that decision. COMMISSIONER DALEY| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14338)|
| 3:59:00| Okay. Commissioner Lutton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14340)|
| 3:59:02| COMMISSIONER LUTTON Say, if I may, there are some where the courts would be required to. Obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14342)|
| 3:59:08| the judges are going to have some discretion on some things. I do think a lot of this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14348)|
| 3:59:14| speculative, though, because as it stands right now, Rule 43 only would allow for arraignments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14354)|
| 3:59:20| and initial appearances. And so, if that rule is changed at some point in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14360)|
| 3:59:26| we have no way of knowing what that rule, how that would read if it were to be changed. And so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14366)|
| 3:59:34| I don't know that I could answer that for certain because it's sort of calls for an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14374)|
| 3:59:38| answer of something that hasn't come to pass. COMMISSIONER DALEY| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14378)|
| 3:59:40| Is the Supreme Court hearing anything about this anytime soon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14380)|
| 3:59:44| COMMISSIONER LUTTON I don't know. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14384)|
| 3:59:47| they have periodically been extending orders. Our initial order from the Supreme Court dates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14387)|
| 3:59:53| back to March of last year. And at that time, they'd set an expiration of that order for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14393)|
| 3:59:57| couple of months. And then it just periodically, as it gets close to the expiration, they extend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14397)|
| 4:00:02| it and they sometimes tweak it a little bit. As our numbers have gone up, sometimes they've made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14402)|
| 4:00:08| some changes. As COVID numbers have gone down, they've made other changes. For example, like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14408)|
| 4:00:11| suspension of jury trials. We're not having jury trials right now, but those are going to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14411)|
| 4:00:15| back up again soon. So, it's, I have no idea what the Supreme Court is going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14415)|
| 4:00:20| COMMISSIONER DALEY Gotcha. Thank you, sir. The second question I had was, we currently have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14420)|
| 4:00:26| three virtual courtrooms, correct? And we'll be adding additional six. So, we'll have nine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14426)|
| 4:00:31| virtual courtrooms in total. Is that correct? COMMISSIONER HAMMOND| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14431)|
| 4:00:37| Mr. Hammond? COMMISSIONER HAMMOND| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14437)|
| 4:00:39| Yes, I'm going to let Mr. Major talk about that because again, he's my IT guru.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14439)|
| 4:00:44| COMMISSIONER HAMMOND Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14444)|
| 4:00:47| Commissioner Ward, that is essentially correct. There are three available spaces with cameras,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14447)|
| 4:00:53| but it's important to note how those are distributed. Obviously, the Sheriff could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14453)|
| 4:00:57| speak to his facility better than I can, but there are two rooms out of the detention facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14457)|
| 4:01:01| on Maloneyville. One of those, those are divided up by men and women, which is a limitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14461)|

| 4:01:14| I wouldn't necessarily call that a full courtroom space, but it is what we may do with if we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14474)|
| 4:01:18| someone who's down in the jail currently. As I understand the proposal, the six spaces out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14478)|
| 4:01:27| the Maloneyville facility would be larger and equipped in such a way to provide a more court-like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14487)|
| 4:01:35| experience for the individuals rather than what is sometimes required now in these tiny spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14495)|
| 4:01:40| we have to make do with. COMMISSIONER HAMMOND| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14500)|
| 4:01:41| Okay. So are we going from three to six or are we going from three to nine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14501)|
| 4:01:45| COMMISSIONER WARD I think the answer is you're going from three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14505)|
| 4:01:49| to the capacity to nine, but really six that are of a sufficient size to conduct a process the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14509)|
| 4:01:55| it ought to be done. COMMISSIONER HAMMOND| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14515)|
| 4:01:56| Okay. So if there is overflow, we do have the ability to go to nine if need be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14516)|
| 4:02:00| is what you're saying? COMMISSIONER WARD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14520)|
| 4:02:01| The issue has always been space. It's not technology. It's having the physical space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14521)|
| 4:02:05| to do so and the place to isolate individuals from the rest of the folks who are being detained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14525)|
| 4:02:09| so that you have the necessary level of quietness to conduct a proceeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14529)|
| 4:02:13| COMMISSIONER HAMMOND Understood. Thank you, sir. My last question is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14533)|
| 4:02:17| from the one I'm reading from the resolution that there's already a contractor in here. Is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14537)|
| 4:02:26| I don't think I've seen that before in any other resolution that's ever come before me, at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14546)|
| 4:02:31| in my limited time on commission. But is that normal? And if so, are there blueprints and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14551)|
| 4:02:36| engineering specs and all that kind of stuff that are out there that we haven't gotten to see yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14556)|
| 4:02:40| And if so, what did the contract bid come in at? What is why is there a contractor already in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14560)|
| 4:02:48| resolution? Is there RFI that went out that I don't know about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14568)|
| 4:02:51| MR. MILLER I think Mr. Myers or Mr. Caldwell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14571)|
| 4:02:56| might want to address that. There are specs and drawings in the presentation online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14576)|
| 4:03:04| COMMISSIONER HAMMOND That's all those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14584)|
| 4:03:05| MR. MILLER Mr. Caldwell or Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14585)|
| 4:03:09| Myers, do either of you want to address that? MR. CALDWELL| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14589)|
| 4:03:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Matt Myers, Knox County Procurement. Yeah, I think in the new resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14593)|
| 4:03:20| we did add a contract for construction. It does have a rendering of the building. It also has a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14600)|
| 4:03:28| floor plan. More engineering documents will be forthcoming, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14608)|
| 4:03:35| for the construction of the building. We wanted to go ahead and get the contract in place as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14615)|
| 4:03:41| on this resolution just so we can get going and get started and get the facility built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14621)|
| 4:03:47| The contractor is one of our term contractors through the Public Building Authority. They do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14627)|
| 4:03:55| contracts to certain levels. The general contractor has been a good contractor for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14635)|
| 4:04:01| Knox County, certainly more than capable to provide this service. Unless Sheriff Spangler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14641)|
| 4:04:10| has any more to add, that's why you see a little bit of amended resolution from last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14650)|
| 4:04:15| COMMISSIONER HAMMOND Is there a number they've given us already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14655)|
| 4:04:18| that they think the construction cost is going to be that's more accurate than just the general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14658)|
| 4:04:24| 1.5 cap? CHAIRMAN HICKS Well, I haven't been given any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14664)|
| 4:04:29| figure other than the 1.5. And that's why we put in the contract that it is not to exceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14669)|
| 4:04:34| $1.5 million. I know Sheriff Spangler and some of his people have probably had a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14674)|
| 4:04:41| deeper conversation as they continue to look at the site, look at the location of where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14681)|
| 4:04:47| building is going to go, how we're connecting to the detention facility and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14687)|
| 4:04:54| Sheriff Spangler? SHERIFF SPANGLER| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14694)|
| 4:04:59| Yes, Matt, you're correct. And part of that is we went off of what our one prefab building that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14699)|
| 4:05:04| we have out there for our training facility was right at $750,000. And the PP&E, just to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14704)|
| 4:05:11| figure all of the rest of it in there, that's where that figure came from, Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14711)|
| 4:05:16| We wanted to make sure we didn't exceed anything. That way, when we come to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14716)|
| 4:05:20| letting you know that could come in even cheaper than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14720)|
| 4:05:22| CHAIRMAN HICKS Okay. So do we have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14722)|
| 4:05:24| competing bids? Or are we just saying we're going to go with this guy and that's it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14724)|
| 4:05:27| SHERIFF SPANGLER That's a question you'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14727)|
| 4:05:30| have to ask Mr. Myers. I think that's had to do with the RA contract that they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14730)|
| 4:05:34| that will take you back and forth. MR. MYERS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14734)|
| 4:05:38| That is correct, Sheriff. You know, the Sheriff's Office came to us with this particular contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14738)|
| 4:05:43| who had already looked at the property. As I said, they are a term contractor. They have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14743)|
| 4:05:48| done numerous projects for us. They're a very trusted, very secure contractor. And I feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14748)|
| 4:05:56| very good about Lynn Shelton or Shelton General Contractors performing the work here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14756)|
| 4:06:01| CHAIRMAN HICKS Sure. I'm sure they're a great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14761)|
| 4:06:03| contracting company. I'm just the Sheriff just told me a building similar to it costs $750,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14763)|
| 4:06:09| You're asking for double and just having us write a blank check just doesn't sit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14769)|
| 4:06:13| particularly well with me. But I understand the situation is also. That's all the questions I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14773)|
| 4:06:18| CHAIRMAN HICKS Okay. Thank you, Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14778)|
| 4:06:24| Commissioner Lundy, you're up next. COMMISSIONER LUNDY| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14784)|
| 4:06:27| Thank you, Chairman Drake. I have a few constituents emailing me and I have a few questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14787)|
| 4:06:33| This is more about the justice of it and this human rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14793)|
| 4:06:37| Would this action cut off public access and transparency within the judicial system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14797)|
| 4:06:42| To some, I answer that. CHAIRMAN HICKS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14802)|
| 4:06:49| Mr. Majors, do you want to address that? Mr. Hammond said you were on the legal side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14809)|
| 4:06:54| MR. HAMMOND I'm happy to, Mr. Chairman. I believe I'm happy to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14814)|
| 4:06:59| As far as transparency and access to the courts, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14819)|
| 4:07:04| looking to a post-pandemic world where you will have open physical courtrooms in the event that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14824)|
| 4:07:12| this video technology was used, people would have access to the physical courtroom in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14832)|
| 4:07:17| same way that they have always had access to a physical courtroom. They would be able to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14837)|
| 4:07:22| the inmate in open court as they're discussing their case for arraignment or whatever other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14842)|
| 4:07:27| matter. The only difference would be that the inmate would not physically be in the room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14847)|
| 4:07:33| but rather would be available by video. But it would still be open courts and open access in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14853)|
| 4:07:37| way that it always was pre-pandemic. COMMISSIONER HICKS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14857)|
| 4:07:42| Okay. Thank you. Another question. Will the individuals facing charges feel more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14862)|
| 4:07:47| isolated and less likely to assess resources and advice from their counsel on their behalf?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14867)|
| 4:07:52| So, I guess I'm saying would they have that privacy to talk to their attorney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14872)|
| 4:07:56| MR. HAMMOND Commissioner, obviously, I don't want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14876)|
| 4:08:03| venture a guess to how folks may feel or what their individual interpretation may be of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14883)|
| 4:08:08| situation. As far as access, though, they would have the same access to meeting with their lawyer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14888)|
| 4:08:14| prior to court as they would in an in-person appearance. That's really all I can say to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14894)|
| 4:08:21| answer that question. Mr. Lutton may have some thoughts on that as well, and the Sheriff can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14901)|
| 4:08:25| speak more to what their actual visitation process at the jail is. But merely having a process like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14905)|
| 4:08:32| an arraignment over video does not prohibit lawyers from meeting with their clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14912)|
| 4:08:38| COMMISSIONER HICKS But the only option will be for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14918)|
| 4:08:40| to meet with them prior to their appearance, but they can't talk to them during the arraignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14920)|
| 4:08:49| MR. HAMMOND Well, if the process that we have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14929)|
| 4:08:52| using now in the courts is what this would look like in the long term, and I think that's probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14932)|
| 4:08:57| a fair assumption, there is a phone line available where lawyers can speak with their clients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14937)|
| 4:09:04| while they are in court if they have any questions and want to have a conversation that is private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14944)|
| 4:09:08| and not open to others. I can't imagine that that would be removed by any judge, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14948)|
| 4:09:14| what's available right now, and that's how that has been handled by the judges for the last nine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14954)|
| 4:09:19| months. COMMISSIONER HICKS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14959)|
| 4:09:22| Mr. Lutton, I would love to hear your thoughts. MR. LUTTON| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14962)|
| 4:09:25| I do think that there are some issues there, and among my concerns is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14965)|
| 4:09:33| practicing law has been incredibly challenging during the pandemic, and one of the ways that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14973)|
| 4:09:39| it is incredibly challenging is not having an ability to lean over and talk to your client,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14979)|
| 4:09:45| or the number of times that I will see things sort of go off the rails a little bit because a client| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14985)|
| 4:09:49| is – you're not directly beside them. During normal times, a client might start to speak up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14989)|
| 4:09:55| and either assert some fact or say something out loud where they really need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14995)|
| 4:09:59| not asking – they need to be asking their lawyer questions and not speaking up and interacting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=14999)|
| 4:10:03| directly with court, and unfortunately, that does happen when you don't have the lawyer that can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15003)|
| 4:10:07| there and put a hand on their shoulder or, hey, ask me the question. There's also – in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15007)|
| 4:10:14| access to justice, there's also issues of – we know from data that recidivism rates go up. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15014)|
| 4:10:23| people are more likely to re-offend if you cut off their community ties when they're incarcerated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15023)|
| 4:10:27| Among the things that happened, even at arraignments – this might not seem like a big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15027)|
| 4:10:31| deal, but even at arraignments where we're getting appointed to a case and the family is there and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15031)|
| 4:10:37| you're able to sort of go talk to the family and talk to your client, hey, your mom's here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15037)|
| 4:10:42| your sister's here. They want to be a pass along that they love you. They're going to try and do a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15042)|
| 4:10:46| video chat with you next Tuesday. The communication that you can sort of have back and forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15046)|
| 4:10:52| contemporaneously, I think is important during court proceedings. Candidly, it is – I do believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15052)|
| 4:11:00| that it is critical during arraignments, but it is obviously more critical in other proceedings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15060)|
| 4:11:07| And so with talk of possibly an attempt to amend Rule 43, which would allow potentially other types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15067)|
| 4:11:13| of proceedings to be heard remotely, I worry what that means for justice going forward. I think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15073)|
| 4:11:20| important to remember that we are supposed to be operating a criminal justice system and not a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15080)|
| 4:11:24| criminal processing system, although I do recognize the challenges of that we are way behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15084)|
| 4:11:31| Thank you. Also, just some data that I just want to share since we are public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15091)|
| 4:11:40| It said one study of criminal bail hearings found that defendants whose hearings are conducted over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15100)|
| 4:11:44| video have a higher bond amount spent than an in-person counterpart. Also, another study of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15104)|
| 4:11:52| immigration courts found that a detained individual will more likely be deported when their hearings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15112)|
| 4:11:58| are carried over video conference rather than person. And then the last one is that three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15118)|
| 4:12:06| out of six surveyed immigrants court judges identified instances where they had changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15126)|
| 4:12:10| credibility assessments made during a video hearing after holding an in-person hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15130)|
| 4:12:16| So, it seems like it's going to be a lot of confusion with communication. I'm all for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15136)|
| 4:12:25| efficiency. I believe in efficiency, but I just don't think this is the right time for this right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15145)|
| 4:12:31| now. I think it's, you know, we still need to—people who are in jail or going on trial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15151)|
| 4:12:38| they're still humans. And I'm with you, Mr. Ludden, that we need to make sure we maintain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15158)|
| 4:12:43| that human contact because they—even though they probably done some bad things or illegal things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15163)|
| 4:12:48| they're still humans and they need to see their family and all this. So, we don't need to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15168)|
| 4:12:53| away that from them. Thank you. Thank you, Commissioner Lundy. By evidence of all of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15173)|
| 4:13:01| reminders that are popping up on the screens around commission, our zoning meeting starts at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15181)|
| 4:13:06| 7. So, I see Commissioner Durrett, Hill, and Beeler. We can either march through and head| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15186)|
| 4:13:16| towards a vote before 7, or we can continue with the conversation, recess, and come back to it. I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15196)|
| 4:13:22| obviously open to either one of those. I just want to keep everybody aware that in 14 minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15202)|
| 4:13:28| we have zoning. So, I'll call on Commissioner Durrett, and we'll see how it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15208)|
| 4:13:33| I'm willing to hold off if we need to, as long as Eric Lutton and Richard Major can be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15213)|
| 4:13:43| as long as they can stay on past the zoning and come back so we can talk with them more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15223)|
| 4:13:48| Gentlemen, do you have the ability to stay with us? I'm seeing a lot of nodded heads that maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15228)|
| 4:13:53| everybody's open for a quick break before we head to zonings, if you're able to stay with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15233)|
| 4:13:58| That won't be a problem, Commissioner. I can certainly do that. Can I ask how long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15238)|
| 4:14:05| you anticipate zoning to last? I'm trying to figure out if I have time to grab a quick dinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15245)|
| 4:14:09| I imagine tonight you will. Grab dinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15249)|
| 4:14:13| Okay. Just reading the tea leaves. So, I'm seeing everybody nodding in consensus that we might have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15253)|
| 4:14:20| a quick break. Now, we will hold and put this meeting into recess and return to item 25. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15260)|
| 4:14:27| we have the long, the ability to have a substantive discussion before a vote on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15267)|
| 4:14:31| item. Is that? Yes, sir. I'm sorry. I've got another venue to get to. I can be available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15271)|
| 4:14:40| by phone or something if need be, or either can text me and I can get back on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15280)|
| 4:14:44| Okay. Hide it for a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15284)|
| 4:14:47| Okay. If you could maybe just have one of your folks kind of put you on call there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15287)|
| 4:14:53| and if we have other questions, maybe we can track you down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15293)|
| 4:14:56| Okay. Everybody okay with taking a quick break and then heading to zonings and then putting this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15296)|
| 4:15:02| meeting in recess? I'm seeing a lot of nods. All right. So, Commission meeting in recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15302)|
| 4:15:08| We will return after zoning. Zonings will start. It is a separate Zoom link, a reminder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15308)|
| 4:15:14| So, you will leave this meeting and jump on that. We'll see you at 7 o'clock for zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15314)|
| 4:15:19| Madam Clerk, we are going to reconvene this Knox County Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15319)|
| 4:15:26| I see all members present. We were on item number 25. And before we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15326)|
| 4:15:36| call on our next set of commissioners for continued discussion, I did receive a message| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15336)|
| 4:15:41| from former Commissioner Hammond and Criminal Court Clerk Hammond to address commission for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15341)|
| 4:15:50| just a minute. So, sir, if you want to jump right back in for just a quick minute before we continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15350)|
| 4:15:55| Great. Thank you so much, Commissioners. During the break, I had an opportunity to huddle with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15355)|
| 4:16:00| my financial people. And I wanted to throw this out to you because I know that funding, you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15360)|
| 4:16:05| doing exactly what you're supposed to do, and that's vetting anything that is going to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15365)|
| 4:16:10| and require an expenditure of funds. And I applaud you for that. My job is to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15370)|
| 4:16:15| that the court functions properly. And that's what we're doing here. And so, what I wanted to do was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15375)|
| 4:16:20| tell you that because of the funding, I want to put my money where my mouth is. I'm prepared to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15380)|
| 4:16:26| write Knox County a check in the morning for $300,000 coming from the excess fee account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15386)|
| 4:16:32| I'm also committing to you another $300,000, which I believe we will get as the courts get up and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15392)|
| 4:16:37| going over the next six to nine months. So, I'm willing to commit to you $600,000. I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15397)|
| 4:16:44| think it's going to be a $1.5 million project, but I'm willing to commit to $600,000. And why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15404)|
| 4:16:49| am I doing that? Well, I didn't know much about the court system before I took this job. I see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15409)|
| 4:16:53| it every day. I see exactly what the needs are. I know that our judges are 100 percent behind this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15413)|
| 4:16:58| It is a necessity. I've told you about the laptops going into the pods, the noise, etc., etc. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15418)|
| 4:17:06| one aspect of it. But we're looking at the entire court system here. This will benefit the entire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15426)|
| 4:17:10| court system. I just feel like that people need to have some privacy. They need to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15430)|
| 4:17:14| something quiet. And there needs to be some dignity as opposed to being in a pod| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15434)|
| 4:17:19| where they're flushing toilets. So, I just wanted you to know that I'm committed to do that. I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15439)|
| 4:17:23| write a check in the morning for $300,000 if you all choose to do that this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15443)|
| 4:17:28| There is a caveat, of course. When I turn over money, it goes to Knox County. It's up to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15448)|
| 4:17:32| folks to appropriate it. And so, I'm willing to do that with the understanding that you folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15452)|
| 4:17:37| would appropriate it toward this video court. So, thank you so much for listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15457)|
| 4:17:41| Thank you, Clerk Hammond. I'm going to pick up on our discussion where we left off. That| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15461)|
| 4:17:45| was with Commissioner Hill. Commissioner Hill? Well, Mike, you're a hard act to follow. Good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15465)|
| 4:17:55| Lord. That's quite an offer. That's much appreciated. I do have just some comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15475)|
| 4:18:09| though. Mr. Hammond, I heard you say and I heard others, a few others allude to the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15489)|
| 4:18:25| you all have a stakeholders meeting. I understand it's your judges and other folks that come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15505)|
| 4:18:33| together weekly or biweekly, pretty regularly, just to discuss the workings of the court and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15513)|
| 4:18:40| to keep things running smoothly. I also heard you say that about three or four months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15520)|
| 4:18:48| this started coming about, this need. And that kind of just goes back to my whole concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15528)|
| 4:18:58| initially about this project. Is it truly a genuine need or is it something that at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15538)|
| 4:19:09| moment is being heavily driven by our situation with COVID and all the adjustments that everyone's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15549)|
| 4:19:20| had to make from beginning to end? Truly, even though it might not have been just two or three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15560)|
| 4:19:26| weeks ago, the powers that be came up with this idea by your own words. It has been in the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15566)|
| 4:19:35| three or four months. So that concerns me greatly because I do believe there is going to be an end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15575)|
| 4:19:44| to this whole scenario, hopefully sooner than later. But we are already, I believe, seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15584)|
| 4:19:52| things start to improve in that regard. Of course, your judges are in a favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15592)|
| 4:20:04| How could you really not be in favor of it? Being in favor of something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15604)|
| 4:20:14| and I'm not saying it's true in this situation, but doesn't necessarily equal a really genuine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15614)|
| 4:20:20| need. And, you know, maybe it is there, maybe it's been there all along. And it's just something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15620)|
| 4:20:29| the courts have just managed to do without. As I said, the whole, all of the information was just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15629)|
| 4:20:37| a little bit new to me on this. So it isn't that I'm opposed to the idea per se, but I am very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15637)|
| 4:20:49| opposed to knee-jerk in spending funds, even though you've reduced that amount greatly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15649)|
| 4:20:57| because you are going to be passing surplus monies over. I just hate to get into something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15657)|
| 4:21:05| like that where down the road we find out it's not something that we genuinely really had to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15665)|
| 4:21:11| I mean, we have heard the sheriff talk about his desperate need for more beds out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15671)|
| 4:21:16| You know, a million dollars isn't a great amount, but, you know, it might buy a bed or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15676)|
| 4:21:24| And I know, too, that we've got real issues with our mental health. So many of our prisoners have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15684)|
| 4:21:33| really dual diagnosis and have serious, serious mental health needs. And just wondering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15693)|
| 4:21:40| if perhaps that monies would not be better diverted toward, I don't know, maybe putting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15700)|
| 4:21:48| in a virtual courtroom over at Helen Ross McNabb where they bring these folks in that have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15708)|
| 4:21:57| picked up at the discretion of the sheriff or the police because they do need some immediate help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15717)|
| 4:22:03| yet they need incarceration. I mean, I've talked to no one about that except just to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15723)|
| 4:22:10| recognize in my own mind how the two are so intertwined and we're so much needing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15730)|
| 4:22:17| you know, recognizing the need for that. So, I mean, really, I don't know about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15737)|
| 4:22:25| civil rights involved. I'm not an attorney. I do have concerns about this Rule 43.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15745)|
| 4:22:38| I mean, the what ifs. We do go back to the way things were prior to the suspension of this rule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15758)|
| 4:22:46| and then we've got those courtrooms sitting out there and that, in fact, could not be utilized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15766)|
| 4:22:52| the way that we hoped. Not never, but not to the amount that we hoped. Again, because of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15772)|
| 4:22:59| rules of our state Supreme Court, not because of anything, you know, we've done here locally. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15779)|
| 4:23:06| those are just all things that have come to mind these last few days as I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15786)|
| 4:23:11| really tried to think through these issues. So, I don't know that that even requires a response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15791)|
| 4:23:19| from anyone, but those are just concerns that I have had trying to look at the big picture and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15799)|
| 4:23:25| all this. Oh, and I do have one more thing to say. I've worked with Tim Irwin for years. You tell him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15805)|
| 4:23:31| he just needs to get on Zoom. This Skype business is for the birds. You know, he can get a computer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15811)|
| 4:23:39| and go sit in his courtroom like he always does and I cannot believe, I just cannot believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15819)|
| 4:23:46| that at the detention facility there isn't some small room someplace, even if a worker has to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15826)|
| 4:23:56| surrender their office for an hour or two a day to let these incarcerated prisoners for child support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15836)|
| 4:24:05| that cannot walk in and have a few moments of privacy while they're dealing with our judge. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15845)|
| 4:24:12| anyway. Thank you, Commissioner Hill. He needs to get with that Zoom program. I would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15852)|
| 4:24:17| respond if that would be appropriate. Sure, go ahead. Okay, well, thank you. I'll sure tell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15857)|
| 4:24:24| Judge Irwin what you said. Yeah, I know he'll appreciate that. Well, Commissioner, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15864)|
| 4:24:30| thank you for your questions. They're very good questions. This is not a knee-jerk reaction. Again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15870)|
| 4:24:33| we've been talking about this for quite some time. What the judges tried to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15873)|
| 4:24:37| was the sessions judges and the criminal judges tried to work out a system whereby the sessions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15877)|
| 4:24:43| judges would use the cameras that are available and then switch over to the criminal judges. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15883)|
| 4:24:49| we found out that wasn't working well because you can't set a time frame and said, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15889)|
| 4:24:53| we'll do an hour and a half. It might be two hours or more just on sessions cases. And so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15893)|
| 4:25:00| you had your criminal judges waiting, trying to get access to the cameras. Now, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15900)|
| 4:25:05| you mentioned the totality. That's one of the things I want to emphasize is the totality of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15905)|
| 4:25:10| what we're talking about. Already, our magistrates are using it through Skype. They're taking laptops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15910)|
| 4:25:18| into the pods. They're doing it three times a day. Over 5,000 people last year were treated this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15918)|
| 4:25:24| And then when you look at what Judge Irwin's doing, he's been doing it for two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15924)|
| 4:25:29| and they do it three times a morning. And they'll have anywhere from 10 to 18 people per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15929)|
| 4:25:34| And we're wanting to expand this to perhaps Magistrate Lindsay McDaniel's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15934)|
| 4:25:40| court, where she also does child support. Judge McMillan, who has orders of protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15940)|
| 4:25:45| has already said he does 10 to 15 a month. He would love to be able to do this as opposed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15945)|
| 4:25:49| having them come down and wait and go into his courtroom for two minutes and then have to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15949)|
| 4:25:53| sent all the way back to the detention facility. So my point is, I would like for you to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15953)|
| 4:25:59| the total picture, because this will be used. It's not something that's just going to go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15959)|
| 4:26:04| And let's say the pandemic stops tomorrow. The judges have already said, in writing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15964)|
| 4:26:10| it's a necessity, and they will use it past the pandemic. So I have a lot of confidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15970)|
| 4:26:15| in our judges, and I believe that this is the right way to go and the right thing to do for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15975)|
| 4:26:19| our court functions. Thank you, Mr. Hammond, and thank you, Ms. Hill. Next up is Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15979)|
| 4:26:29| Thank you, Mr. Chair. I had a question. I'm not sure who exactly this would be for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15989)|
| 4:26:37| but it has to deal with, I know Sheriff Spengler said earlier when he was here that they would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=15997)|
| 4:26:44| accepting plea agreements through this, and it was my understanding that that would not be possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16004)|
| 4:26:50| under Rule 43 once the Supreme Court order expires. Can someone elaborate on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16010)|
| 4:27:01| Yeah, that would be accurate. Absent some change in the rule, what Rule 43 lays out is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16021)|
| 4:27:09| audio, where you're permitted to use audiovisual equipment to have a person appear remotely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16029)|
| 4:27:16| The Supreme Court's order, because of the pandemic, in response to the pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16036)|
| 4:27:20| has specifically suspended Rule 43 and has basically opened it up to allow us to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16040)|
| 4:27:26| many different types of proceedings using audiovisual technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16046)|
| 4:27:32| It is my reading of the law and my belief that unless that rule is changed, it would not be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16052)|
| 4:27:37| permissible to do plea agreements remotely once that Supreme Court order expires. In terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16057)|
| 4:27:45| whether or not there are constitutional issues, I think that that's something that would have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16065)|
| 4:27:48| be litigated. I don't know if, candidly, I don't know the answer to that. It does strike me as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16068)|
| 4:27:55| somewhat interesting that the Supreme Court at least sort of considers that as an option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16075)|
| 4:28:02| that there might be constitutional issues, because in the order that they've sent out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16082)|
| 4:28:06| the most recent one, dated December the 22nd of 2020, actually had a line in there that in-person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16086)|
| 4:28:13| proceedings were suspended, but it listed plea agreements as an exception to that. So, I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16093)|
| 4:28:17| 100 percent certain if we are completely adhering to the order or not, but that is what it is. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16097)|
| 4:28:25| I don't know if the Supreme Court would want to change that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16105)|
| 4:28:28| Okay. And will someone please remind me the answer, I believe the question was from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16108)|
| 4:28:35| Commissioner Lundy on in-person access to lawyers. Was that answered? It was right before we were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16115)|
| 4:28:46| we ended to go to zoning. I spoke to that somewhat. I think that what has been proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16126)|
| 4:28:53| and I'm sure Mr. Hammond will correct me if I mistake this, but I believe that what has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16133)|
| 4:28:58| proposed is that you would have six sort of virtual courtrooms, and then I believe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16138)|
| 4:29:03| they also had anticipated six rooms off of that where someone could go and take a phone call from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16143)|
| 4:29:10| their lawyer. You know, and I do want to say that while that certainly does provide you some access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16150)|
| 4:29:18| to your client, it is not the same being able to have a face-to-face conversation with someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16158)|
| 4:29:27| in order to instead have that conversation telephonically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16167)|
| 4:29:32| Okay. Thank you, Mr. Lutton. I am, I understand that technology is the future and that we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16172)|
| 4:29:41| to progress with it as we can, but also at the same time, we don't need to, I feel like this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16181)|
| 4:29:49| becoming more of let's push it through, let's save money in this term of being processed versus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16189)|
| 4:29:55| administering justice. And so that's where my concerns lie. But thank you everyone for your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16195)|
| 4:30:01| remarks. Thank you, Commissioner Durrett. Next up is Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16201)|
| 4:30:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Wow. I guess two or three things here. One, I want to just start out by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16206)|
| 4:30:14| saying, you know, I know we've gotten some emails, at least I've gotten them, I assume other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16214)|
| 4:30:18| commissioners have gotten them too, that have directed their opposition to this toward the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16218)|
| 4:30:25| Sheriff's Department. And I don't know that that's entirely fair. As, you know, Sheriff Spangler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16225)|
| 4:30:30| stated this, the Sheriff is only one player in this. And I'm confident that if Sheriff Spangler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16230)|
| 4:30:41| were going to ask for a million and a half dollars to solely benefit his organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16241)|
| 4:30:47| it probably would not be for this. At least it wouldn't be the first thing on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16247)|
| 4:30:52| So there, you know, there's certainly numerous stakeholders and that's been well stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16252)|
| 4:30:56| tonight. When I first heard about this, I definitely did have some concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16256)|
| 4:31:01| constitutional concerns, civil rights concerns, those sorts of things. And those have been brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16261)|
| 4:31:06| up, certainly rights to representation, rights to face one's accusers and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16266)|
| 4:31:15| It appears to me from everything I'm hearing that those rights would be preserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16275)|
| 4:31:24| In other words, there would be certain types of proceedings that simply would have to be done in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16284)|
| 4:31:30| person and would continue to be done in person. And any defendant would be able to at least appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16290)|
| 4:31:36| to a judge to ask, to request that his proceedings, his or her proceedings be done in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16296)|
| 4:31:44| And so this comes down to the fact that we are using video for certain proceedings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16304)|
| 4:31:55| Certainly under Rule 43, whatever is being referred to as what the Supreme Court has put down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16315)|
| 4:32:02| that's going to expire, I assume April 1st will theoretically will go back to normal. Now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16322)|
| 4:32:09| we don't know that for sure, obviously based on how COVID is going to behave, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16329)|
| 4:32:16| you know, even were that to happen, there would still be some things that are done remotely by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16336)|
| 4:32:23| video. And I think one issue would be we need to improve the quality of how that's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16343)|
| 4:32:34| I mean, even if we're only doing, even if we're doing fewer things by video than we are currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16354)|
| 4:32:42| in the COVID pandemic, anything we do on video needs to be done in as high quality way as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16362)|
| 4:32:47| possibly can. And I think this is going to improve that if this facility is built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16367)|
| 4:32:54| I hate to think that this is just sort of haphazardly, you know, laptops being put fast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16374)|
| 4:32:58| into pods and, you know, going into this person's office or that person's office. I think there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16378)|
| 4:33:03| needs to be a consistent place and way in which this is done that's as high quality as it can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16383)|
| 4:33:10| done. And, you know, anytime something new begins to become more normative, it's always hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16390)|
| 4:33:27| for the people that use whatever that thing is on a regular basis to imagine. Case in point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16407)|
| 4:33:35| you know, I worked in the registrar's office for 31 years, and I can remember 30 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16415)|
| 4:33:40| no one could imagine property records being electronic rather than paper. And yet it happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16420)|
| 4:33:49| It happened. And even as recently as 10 or 15 years ago, I could not have imagined property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16429)|
| 4:33:57| records being recorded electronically. And there not being a piece of paper with ink, original ink| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16437)|
| 4:34:06| and a raised notary seal that's actually brought to the registrar's office and presented to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16446)|
| 4:34:11| registrar to be authenticated in that way that there would actually be an electronic way that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16451)|
| 4:34:16| that could be done for something as vital as property records. And yet here we are in 2021,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16456)|
| 4:34:21| and both of those things have become the norm. And so even though I hope that constitutionally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16461)|
| 4:34:32| in-person hearings don't go away, and certainly the right to jury trial and sentencing and things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16472)|
| 4:34:38| of that nature would still be done face-to-face, even if this type of technology moves forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16478)|
| 4:34:44| incremental in the justice system, we got to be prepared for that. And this is an opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16484)|
| 4:34:50| I feel like, where, you know, the money's there and the need is there, certainly there in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16490)|
| 4:34:58| short term. I don't think it's going to go away in the long term. And so, you know, short of my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16498)|
| 4:35:06| constitutional concerns, I think one of the most important jobs of this body is to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16506)|
| 4:35:12| all of our offices, including our judiciary and law enforcement, are equipped to do their jobs as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16512)|
| 4:35:20| well as they possibly can while preserving the basic rights of individuals. And so I would lean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16520)|
| 4:35:29| toward trusting the judges and the clerk and the sheriff that this will be stewarded well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16529)|
| 4:35:37| and this will be useful in carrying out their duties. So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16537)|
| 4:35:42| Mr. Chairman, Commissioner Mack, might I respond briefly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16542)|
| 4:35:46| Yes, sir. We've got a few more comments. So, very sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16546)|
| 4:35:48| Absolutely. Well, we'll be here as long as you want us to be here. Commissioner Beeler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16548)|
| 4:35:53| when I took over the clerk's office, as you know, we were woefully behind the technology. We had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16553)|
| 4:35:58| people still using typewriters. So, we have come leaps and bounds from where we were. I use the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16558)|
| 4:36:03| mantra in the court system. Our mantra was, today's technology tomorrow. And so, it was very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16563)|
| 4:36:10| very difficult to try to get folks to come on board. But once they did, they found out it works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16570)|
| 4:36:15| well, just like you did in the registrar's office. I might also add, we're already doing video| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16575)|
| 4:36:21| in Nashville with the Department of Corrections. And so, we have, and the state put it in. And so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16581)|
| 4:36:26| right now in our criminal, at least one of our criminal courtrooms, we can access the Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16586)|
| 4:36:31| of Corrections in Nashville, and they can actually have proceedings there. And so, I say that to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16591)|
| 4:36:39| this is the wave of the future, and we have an opportunity now to do this. And I'm convinced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16599)|
| 4:36:44| it's not going to trample on people's constitutional rights. Nobody wants that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16604)|
| 4:36:48| But, you know, the judges have said it ain't going to happen. They're under a Supreme Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16608)|
| 4:36:53| dictate to make sure it doesn't happen. But we also need to understand that this is going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16613)|
| 4:36:59| help us be more efficient with what we already have. Again, I go back to what's going on in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16619)|
| 4:37:03| pods, like you mentioned, the laptops. So, I would appreciate, thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16623)|
| 4:37:08| Commissioner Schoonmaker, I'm going to continue with first round comments before we go to second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16628)|
| 4:37:12| round comments for those who have spoken on the topic. Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16632)|
| 4:37:17| Thank you, Chairman Jay. Clerk Hammond, I was very impressed in your letter to the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16637)|
| 4:37:25| that you did reach out to another county in Tennessee that has a video courtroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16645)|
| 4:37:32| and you referenced Chattanooga, or as we know it as Hamilton County, and they're using it in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16652)|
| 4:37:38| their criminal courts. And I believe in the correspondence, you said they've been using it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16658)|
| 4:37:42| for about two years or more. Is that correct? Yes, I touched base with the criminal court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16662)|
| 4:37:48| clerk in Hamilton County, Vince Dean, and he told me that they have been using it two to three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16668)|
| 4:37:53| They have three criminal divisions like we do, and each division has its own quote video courtroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16673)|
| 4:37:59| So, they've been doing this for two to three years, and this was even before the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16679)|
| 4:38:03| And so, they have been able to use it effectively. And so, the hope is that we, and I'm sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16683)|
| 4:38:10| that's what we would do as well, is use it effectively. Okay, great. And so, I'm assuming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16690)|
| 4:38:16| that we've got some competent civil rights attorneys in Hamilton County that if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16696)|
| 4:38:21| were violating the rights of individuals in Tennessee, that one of those individuals would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16701)|
| 4:38:27| file suit in Hamilton County, but that apparently has not happened. So, this video courtroom doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16707)|
| 4:38:33| violate people's rights as we possibly heard earlier in public forum. And then the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16713)|
| 4:38:40| question I had is that if we move to a virtual or video courtroom, does that bar the members of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16720)|
| 4:38:48| public defender's office from appearing with the individual in the courtroom as opposed to being on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16728)|
| 4:38:56| the phone? Are they prohibited from going to Maloneyville Road facility and participating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16736)|
| 4:39:04| in the video courtroom? I can speak to that. I do not believe that we would be prohibited from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16744)|
| 4:39:12| doing so, but I think logistically, you have to understand what it's like to walk into court with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16752)|
| 4:39:17| 25 cases on the docket. And if you have, and I think the way that this is envisioned is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16757)|
| 4:39:24| you know, attorneys typically go into court and then they get in line. And then when you get to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16764)|
| 4:39:28| the front of the line, you get to call your case up. And so, if you have some of your clients that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16768)|
| 4:39:32| are physically present in the courthouse and some of your clients that are physically out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16772)|
| 4:39:36| Maloneyville Road, we, you know, as an attorney, you can't be in two different places at once. And so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16776)|
| 4:39:41| it is not unusual for public defenders to have five different courts or six different courts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16781)|
| 4:39:45| that they have to be in, in any given day. It is not unusual to have, you know, a dozen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16785)|
| 4:39:50| a couple dozen cases, depending on what your case assignments look like that day, on the docket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16790)|
| 4:39:54| And so, leaving the courthouse, driving out to Maloneyville to stand beside your client there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16794)|
| 4:39:59| then getting back in your car, driving back to the city county building to try and take up the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16799)|
| 4:40:02| other cases you have, would not be possible. There are rare days when you only have a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16802)|
| 4:40:10| of cases on the docket. And in that instance, one certainly could, if all of their cases were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16810)|
| 4:40:15| individuals out at Maloneyville. Okay. Well, but once this, this, if this goes forward and once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16815)|
| 4:40:22| this courtroom is established, possibly scheduling then could be consideration for the time of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16822)|
| 4:40:30| public defenders and that could be worked out. But anyways, Mr. Chairman, I see we have one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16830)|
| 4:40:35| more hand up, but I'm ready to vote on this issue. Thank you very much, Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16835)|
| 4:40:41| Commissioner Daley, second round comment. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Hammond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16841)|
| 4:40:48| what do you want to do with that $300,000 if you don't give it to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16848)|
| 4:40:54| I'm turning it over anyway. So, I was just saying that I have the money and I'm happy to turn it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16854)|
| 4:41:00| over to you all in the morning to pay for this video courtroom. But again, that's your money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16860)|
| 4:41:04| when I turn it over. So, I can't tell you how to spend it. I'm just making an offer that I can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16864)|
| 4:41:09| that. And I'm pretty confident we could do another $300,000 that you could allocate toward it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16869)|
| 4:41:13| if funding is an issue. Well, I took it that you said that if it didn't pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16873)|
| 4:41:19| you wouldn't turn that money over. So. Oh, no, no, no. You're going to get the money. It's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16879)|
| 4:41:23| that I just want to make sure you all knew that you could, that you could apply it. I just wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16883)|
| 4:41:28| you to clear that up. Yes, sir. Sheriff Spangler. I don't know if Sheriff Spangler's back on yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16888)|
| 4:41:38| He texted that he was on his way back, but I do see him actually. I don't see him, but I see his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16898)|
| 4:41:44| box. Sheriff Spangler, are you still with us? I'm all there. I just don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16904)|
| 4:41:49| video capability right yet. Go ahead, Commissioner Galey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16909)|
| 4:41:53| Sheriff, we've heard in some of our meetings that a lot of the inmates are waiting on a judge to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16913)|
| 4:42:01| decide to either give them bonds or get them to their first hearing, which was a really high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16921)|
| 4:42:09| percentage. Am I stating that correctly? Are you talking about they're just having to wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16929)|
| 4:42:16| for arraignment? Is that what you're talking about? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16936)|
| 4:42:21| Well, once they come to court, now they may be there a while because of the cases and depend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16941)|
| 4:42:28| on how many people they've brought in. That could be possible, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16948)|
| 4:42:32| Could we cut that time down with the video court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16952)|
| 4:42:35| Well, as soon as they get up there, then obviously they do, but then what happens if they finish the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16955)|
| 4:42:42| case right then, then that individual, once they do the release on them, they're taken downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16962)|
| 4:42:47| immediately instead of being taken back out to the facility and then brought back to the downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16967)|
| 4:42:53| So there are ways for this video court to work in the future, there's no doubt. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16973)|
| 4:43:00| I see it as an efficient issue. Eric and I had a discussion last week. I think he could work it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16980)|
| 4:43:08| to where, like Commissioner Schoonmaker said, that they do scheduling. One day it'd be video| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16988)|
| 4:43:14| court, one day it'd be at downtown. It's just about scheduling is what it is. Just because we did it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16994)|
| 4:43:19| one way all the time, don't mean that we can't look for better, more efficient ways to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=16999)|
| 4:43:27| I think this is a good thing. I think it's going to be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=17007)|
| 4:43:30| We've been threatened on County Commission to be sued many, many times and we probably end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=17010)|
| 4:43:35| up getting sued. But that brings to my next question. Law Director, are you there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=17015)|
| 4:43:42| I'm here. Hey, you've been sitting here listening to this and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=17022)|
| 4:43:46| the 43 and, you know, the citizens rights and all that. So I just, I don't think any of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=17026)|
| 4:43:56| the judges are not going to put us in a position to where we will be sued. I don't think they would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=17036)|
| 4:44:01| do that. So I will give you the opportunity to fill in from the taxpayer side as you're the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=17041)|
| 4:44:08| Law Director, what you think about all the conversation that's been going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=17048)|
| 4:44:13| Well, it's been good conversation and I'm not going to enter into the merits of the policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=17053)|
| 4:44:18| decision one way or the other. But I was concerned that there were some talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=17058)|
| 4:44:24| threats of lawsuits. Well, us lawyers just don't listen to threats of lawsuits. It doesn't bother| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=17064)|
| 4:44:31| us, but it should bother the taxpayers. But keep in mind this, these people that go into the judicial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=17071)|
| 4:44:40| system, we can't be sued for what happens in the judicial system. No way. The judges have absolute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=17080)|
| 4:44:49| immunity under law. Whatever the judges do has to be dealt with. If the defendant is in disagreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=17089)|
| 4:44:58| he files a criminal court of appeals. With regard to the federal lawsuits, they just can't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=17098)|
| 4:45:06| They won't happen. Contrary to what's been represented to this body in Chattanooga,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=17106)|
| 4:45:15| I have seen no lawsuits come out of what Chattanooga has been doing for the last two or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=17115)|
| 4:45:20| three years. Additionally, this office reads every single case that comes out of the Sixth Circuit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=17120)|
| 4:45:28| Federal Court of Appeals where all these civil rights suits are filed. Every single case, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=17128)|
| 4:45:33| come down, several of them a day. I have not seen in this Sixth Circuit, which includes Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=17133)|
| 4:45:40| Kentucky, Ohio, and Michigan, I have not seen one case in which a civil rights violation was even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=17140)|
| 4:45:48| asserted with regard to any kind of action taken by the judiciary in these states, whether it be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=17148)|
| 4:45:58| by virtual that we're talking about or whatever. It just doesn't happen, and the absolute immunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=17158)|
| 4:46:06| takes that away. The sheriff cannot be sued for what the judges do, so he's got immunity on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=17166)|
| 4:46:13| This commission cannot be sued if this commission decides that this is the way that they want to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=17173)|
| 4:46:19| and build this building. The threat of a civil rights lawsuit is just, in my opinion, non-existent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=17179)|
| 4:46:27| The other thing is it bothered me. There's an implication. I know these judges. I know every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=17187)|

| 4:46:38| these judges is going to let anything violate the civil rights and the constitutional rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=17198)|
| 4:46:47| of these people coming before them. It just is not going to happen. To make the implication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=17207)|
| 4:46:53| that there would be a violation of civil rights for a judge allowing something to go on like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=17213)|
| 4:46:58| is just, well, for whatever word, it's balderdash. It just is not possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=17218)|
| 4:47:04| These judges are too good. They're not going to let it happen. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=17224)|
| 4:47:09| Thank you, Mr. Law Director. Mr. Chairman, if you don't have a comment, I'll call for the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=17229)|
| 4:47:13| but if you have a comment, that's good. Could I respond very briefly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=17233)|
| 4:47:18| Call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=17238)|
| 4:47:24| You're on mute, Mr. Chairman. I'm getting t-shirts made. I'm going to let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=17244)|
| 4:47:34| Mr. Lutton respond very quickly. I'm going to have a final comment, and then we'll look to a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=17254)|
| 4:47:39| Yeah, I just want to be very clear that I was not suggesting that there would be lawsuits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=17259)|
| 4:47:44| and I was not at all suggesting that our judges would intentionally violate anyone's rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=17264)|

| 4:47:53| the point that I was trying to illustrate was that some of the ways that I'd heard that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=17273)|
| 4:47:58| facility might be proposed to be used, we might not be permitted to use it that way simply because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=17278)|

| 4:59:14| And there were a few places that meet that need. The expo meets that need really well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=17954)|
| 4:59:17| but the expo is $2,900 every time we use it. And it's not predictable. They have events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=17957)|
| 4:59:23| we can't always say that we're going to be able to have it. So this space offered us that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=17963)|
| 4:59:27| predictability. If I give you a vaccine today, I know in 21 to 28 days, I can give you a vaccine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=17967)|
| 4:59:35| again in the same location. And that's really important to our community. People need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=17975)|
| 4:59:39| able to get their second doses. And we need predictability so that we can do that. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=17979)|
| 4:59:45| this space offers that and our staff looked at lots of different spaces. I've worked with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=17985)|
| 4:59:51| Mr. Meyer's staff and looked at lots of different options. And this was the option that offered us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=17991)|
| 4:59:58| the accessibility we needed and the predictability that we needed to be able to continually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=17998)|
| 5:00:06| offer vaccine to the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18006)|
| 5:00:12| Okay. Matt, when you say you looked at three other places, one on Clinton Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18012)|
| 5:00:16| one on Western Avenue, were they food city locations too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18016)|
| 5:00:23| I know one was a food city location. I'm not sure about the one on Western Avenue. It may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18023)|
| 5:00:28| have been. It's just on past 640 as you're headed. I'm going to say that that's north or west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18028)|
| 5:00:34| It's up on the left side. It's been vacant for a little while. I'm assuming it was a food city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18034)|
| 5:00:42| We just, you know, really just looked at the window and looked at the condition of it and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18042)|
| 5:00:46| looked at the layout of the parking lot and accessibility in and out of the location and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18046)|
| 5:00:54| just didn't seem to flow very well. Okay. Did we look at the Kroger's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18054)|
| 5:01:00| the former Kroger's next to the Expo Center? Yes. It was considered as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18060)|
| 5:01:07| Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Commissioner Smith. Commissioner Ward, you are up next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18067)|
| 5:01:20| I've got a security question for the new location. Are we going to be receiving shipments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18080)|
| 5:01:27| of vaccines to this location? We will not be receiving shipments of vaccine to that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18087)|
| 5:01:35| Shipments of vaccine will continue to come to the 140 Dameron Avenue location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18095)|
| 5:01:41| And as we've been doing throughout this pandemic, we will be transporting vaccine to the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18101)|
| 5:01:48| And thankfully, we have had no security issues with that transport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18108)|
| 5:01:56| Is there going to be a secure section there to hold the vaccines while they're being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18116)|
| 5:02:01| waited to be distributed out? We will have Knox County Sheriff's Office and or KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18121)|
| 5:02:10| available on site as needed. They've been standing by when we've had events and we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18130)|
| 5:02:16| again, have had no security issues to date, which we're really grateful for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18136)|
| 5:02:20| And is there a bus route nearby so that our poor residents can access the site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18140)|
| 5:02:27| There is a bus route nearby. Actually, it's more accessible by bus route than the Expo Center is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18147)|
| 5:02:35| Thank you. Commissioner Daley. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Hey, Matt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18155)|
| 5:02:44| Sounds like the this process was that you were given a set of criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18164)|
| 5:02:50| You and whoever it was went to these buildings and you looked at these buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18170)|
| 5:02:55| You did not talk to anybody about the building until you determined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18175)|
| 5:02:59| what was the best building. And then that's when you went in negotiations. Am I right or wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18179)|
| 5:03:07| That's somewhat correct, Commissioner Daley. You know, we did talk with the health department. We,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18187)|
| 5:03:14| you know, understood what they were looking for and accessibility of the site was of paramount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18194)|
| 5:03:21| importance as well as flow within these. That's why we're kind of looking at a big box type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18201)|
| 5:03:27| area. We can separate people in an area like this. You know, there's 40,000, 50,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18207)|
| 5:03:34| You know, you can get quite a few people in there six feet apart. Once we, you know, found two or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18214)|
| 5:03:41| three suitable ones and we engaged the health department personnel and they actually kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18221)|
| 5:03:47| went out with us and thought, yes, yes, this will work and no, that wouldn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18227)|
| 5:03:53| Can you, my head off a public records request, you probably want to send us an email or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18233)|
| 5:04:01| the sites that you did visit. And as you don't, that would be something I would do in the name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18241)|
| 5:04:06| of the science. Go ahead. Yeah, sure. We all send you send you a list of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18246)|
| 5:04:14| And, man, I had one more question, but I apologize that for that. So thank you, Matt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18254)|
| 5:04:24| Thank you, Dr. B. Thank you, Commissioner Daley, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18264)|
| 5:04:29| Thank you, Chairman Jay. Mr. Myers, I just wanted to say I really appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18269)|
| 5:04:35| your opening comments. I think people that are watching this broadcast probably don't understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18275)|
| 5:04:42| how difficult the decisions that the procurement team does for Knox County. And I just I really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18282)|
| 5:04:51| appreciate it. And I think that exemplifies, you know, the standards of all of our departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18291)|
| 5:04:57| in Knox County with you coming out and making the statement you did. And I appreciate what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18297)|
| 5:05:01| you guys are doing for us. And it's one of those where you can never make the right decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18301)|
| 5:05:07| It's a no win situation a lot of times. But personally, I really appreciate what you do for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18307)|
| 5:05:12| us. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Is there any other questions or comments for item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18312)|
| 5:05:19| number 37? Commissioner Biggs. Thank you, Chairman. Can you anybody direct me in all this data where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18319)|
| 5:05:29| the actual dollar amount is that Commissioner Daley was talking about the additional funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18329)|
| 5:05:34| for basically the setup at the food city that he was speaking on earlier, I was looking for and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18334)|
| 5:05:39| couldn't find it. Additional funding, sorry. Basically, open the doors, ready to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18339)|
| 5:05:56| administering the shots. What additional funding is or what was that going to cost as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18356)|
| 5:06:01| That's kind of the direction that I was listening to earlier. Maybe I wasn't listening in the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18361)|
| 5:06:06| way, but I thought that's what we were getting at. Matt, I'm not clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18366)|
| 5:06:16| I think the question is beyond the lease agreement at $57 a month, is there any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18376)|
| 5:06:21| additional funding needed to open the doors and begin vaccination?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18381)|
| 5:06:25| Exactly. I believe Kevin Parton from my department is on. He may be able to answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18385)|
| 5:06:31| that question. I know that we've purchased some tables and chairs and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18391)|
| 5:06:37| So, Kevin, do you have that information? Mr. Parton, if you would just identify yourself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18397)|
| 5:06:43| for the record, please. Kevin Parton, Knox County Health Department. The only additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18403)|
| 5:06:48| things that we need to do, we purchased tables and chairs, as Dr. Buchanan said, and that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18408)|
| 5:06:54| approximately $13,000 total for 50 tables and 150 chairs. We'll have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18414)|
| 5:07:04| get internet service so that we have networking capabilities, things of that nature. All of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18424)|
| 5:07:12| the funds that we spend will be reimbursed to the county through our ELC grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18432)|
| 5:07:18| So, I don't expect anything to go awry there. Okay. So, does that grant, does that also offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18438)|
| 5:07:25| the opportunity for, you know, your social distancing screens and things of that nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18445)|
| 5:07:30| your placing glasses, stuff like that, that we're going to need? Yes, it does. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18450)|
| 5:07:37| Let's see, second round of questions, Commissioner Daley and then Smith. Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18457)|
| 5:07:42| Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I don't remember what I was going to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18462)|
| 5:07:45| but that brought up another question. Kevin and Dr. B, we spent $13,000 on tables and chairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18465)|
| 5:07:53| So, what are we going to do with these tables and chairs when this pandemic's over with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18473)|
| 5:07:57| That's something to look at. So, if you don't have an answer for that, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18477)|
| 5:08:04| Matt, what I was going to say is that I understand the process that you went through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18484)|
| 5:08:09| It would take, how many days will it take to do an RFI or an RFQ when we don't have that much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18489)|
| 5:08:14| time to do something like that? So, I just want to let you know, I think I understand why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18494)|
| 5:08:19| we did this the way we did because we're looking at 45, 60 days out before we even get a request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18499)|
| 5:08:26| for information or proposal. Thank you. And if I may, Commissioner Daley, we actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18506)|
| 5:08:36| will keep some of those tables and chairs for future events, but then we will sell those that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18516)|
| 5:08:43| we don't need on the government website that I can't think of the name of. It's Gov. GovDeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18523)|
| 5:08:53| GovDeals. Thank you. Okay. Commissioner Daley, is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18533)|
| 5:08:58| out of all your questions? Okay. Thank you very much. I see Commissioner Smith, your hand up as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18538)|
| 5:09:03| well. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Hey, Matt, I really want to thank you. I know the job you have and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18543)|
| 5:09:10| how hard it is and how professional you actually are at it. So, I appreciate everything you do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18550)|
| 5:09:17| sir. My question on this lease is, as distribution of the vaccine becomes more and more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18557)|
| 5:09:28| available through primary care positions and other outlets, is there a possibility that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18568)|
| 5:09:35| we may not need a six-month lease and can it be terminated earlier if we reach that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18575)|
| 5:09:42| Dr. Buchanan? Well, I'll say a couple of things about that and then I'll let Matt or Kevin talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18582)|
| 5:09:49| specifically about how we, the details of the contract. But what I will say is that the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18589)|
| 5:09:56| just issued a three-year grant for COVID vaccine to health departments to increase vaccine access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18596)|
| 5:10:05| So, based on that, the state and federal government anticipate the public health will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18605)|
| 5:10:11| very intimately involved in COVID vaccinations going forward for quite some time. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18611)|
| 5:10:18| I anticipate that we will continue to need to be involved in that. Our involvement will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18618)|
| 5:10:23| maybe not decrease. Our involvement will probably stay the same, but other people's involvement will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18623)|
| 5:10:28| increase. And so, we will continue to be an intimate part of and a vital part of vaccinating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18628)|
| 5:10:34| our community. And of course, there is also talk of potential for boosters to fight against the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18634)|
| 5:10:42| variant. So, I see us continuing to be very engaged in vaccinating the community over quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18642)|
| 5:10:52| And six months for sure, if not longer. Okay. And Kevin, you had mentioned that this federal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18652)|
| 5:11:01| grant that we're going to be buying FF&E furniture with that we could liquidate it after we're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18661)|
| 5:11:09| Does the grant allow for liquidation of these assets purchased with this money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18669)|
| 5:11:14| Yes, sir. They're our assets once we purchase them. They have a typically it's a $5,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18674)|
| 5:11:22| limit on anything along those lines before it would be tagged as state property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18682)|
| 5:11:27| Okay. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18687)|
| 5:11:31| Okay. Is there any further discussion on item number 37?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18691)|
| 5:11:35| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18695)|

| 5:11:37| May I, before we put this on good deals, let's make sure that we don't need these in our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18697)|
| 5:11:42| and all the other places before we sell them a $50 table for $5, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18702)|

| 5:12:03| Just approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18723)|
| 5:12:07| Okay. Seeing no further discussion, we have a proper motion on the table from Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18727)|
| 5:12:11| Daly to approve and a second by Commissioner Beeler. Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18731)|

| 5:13:00| Thank you very much. Good luck with the project, and we look forward to hearing when it's open so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18780)|
| 5:13:03| we can help promote the center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18783)|

| 5:13:09| You have a next item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18789)|
| 5:13:11| Sorry. On page 11, resolution R-21-2-804.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18791)|
| 5:13:20| This is a resolution authorizing an amendment to development agreement between Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18800)|
| 5:13:25| and BNA Associates LLC relating to the Andrew Johnson building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18805)|
| 5:13:29| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18809)|
| 5:13:34| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18814)|
| 5:13:36| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18816)|
| 5:13:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18819)|
| 5:13:40| First by Commissioner Lundy, second by Commissioner Hill to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18820)|
| 5:13:45| Is there a discussion on item number 44?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18825)|
| 5:13:47| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18827)|
| 5:13:50| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18830)|
| 5:13:52| Mr. Caldwell, I see you there, so you know my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18832)|
| 5:13:55| Just for the record, we're voting on the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18835)|
| 5:13:58| We're not voting on the pilot at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18838)|
| 5:14:02| Correct. All we're doing is changing the development agreement to extend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18842)|
| 5:14:06| the approval period of the pilot to April| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18846)|
| 5:14:15| because the third party review did not get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18855)|
| 5:14:18| And we're actually joined by Mr. Mabentoff as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18858)|
| 5:14:22| if you have any questions for him, but all this truly is is an extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18862)|
| 5:14:27| Okay, and I've requested, and I'm sure you will send us the report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18867)|
| 5:14:32| from the third party when it gets ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18872)|
| 5:14:35| As soon as we get it, you'll have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18875)|
| 5:14:37| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18877)|
| 5:14:40| Is there additional discussion on item number 44?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18880)|
| 5:14:47| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18887)|
| 5:14:54| You are muted, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18894)|
| 5:14:58| I'll buy one of those T-shirts too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18898)|
| 5:15:02| Thank you, Chairman Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18902)|
| 5:15:05| I guess then it's the will of the body that we continue to pursue a pilot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18905)|
| 5:15:15| for the Andrew Johnson Building with a positive vote tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18915)|
| 5:15:20| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18920)|
| 5:15:21| Or if we don't want to go forward with a pilot for the Andrew Johnson Building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18921)|
| 5:15:27| we could deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18927)|
| 5:15:30| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18930)|
| 5:15:35| If you denied this...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18935)|
| 5:15:37| Can you identify yourself, sir, for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18937)|
| 5:15:39| Oh, I'm so sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18939)|
| 5:15:40| Yes, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18940)|
| 5:15:41| I just got back from vacation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18941)|
| 5:15:42| I'm sorry I'm a little bit sloppy tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18942)|
| 5:15:45| But this is Mark Mabentoff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18945)|
| 5:15:48| Bass Creek and Sims, 1215 Great Oaks Way, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18948)|
| 5:15:51| And Mr. Schoonmaker, you're absolutely correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18951)|
| 5:15:54| If you all did not approve this, the development agreement would end by its terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18954)|
| 5:15:58| But by voting in favor of this, please understand you're not supporting a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18958)|
| 5:16:04| You're just supporting having the information to decide whether you want to give a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18964)|
| 5:16:10| It's a complicated calculation because of the transition from apartments to hotel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18970)|
| 5:16:16| after five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18976)|
| 5:16:16| It's something we discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18976)|
| 5:16:17| I know it's something Commissioner Schoonmakers asked a lot of good questions about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18977)|
| 5:16:21| And so as we dove into the numbers, it took Philip a while to get the numbers to Thad Wilson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18981)|
| 5:16:26| who's the guy who does the third-party report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18986)|
| 5:16:29| And he was backed up a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18989)|
| 5:16:30| And I was trying to jam and get them to have it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18990)|
| 5:16:34| But it was going to get to you right at the last minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18994)|
| 5:16:37| And I know you guys want to read this really carefully and have the time to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=18997)|
| 5:16:40| And so that's why we asked for this delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19000)|
| 5:16:43| But if you choose not to give the delay, Commissioner Schoonmakers is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19003)|
| 5:16:46| The agreement would end by its terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19006)|
| 5:16:50| And that would save the developer, what, about $10,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19010)|
| 5:16:56| Yeah, the only reason I'm smiling is he's already paid it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19016)|
| 5:16:58| But yes, he'd probably get some refund because they've done some of the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19018)|
| 5:17:02| But yes, it would save him some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19022)|
| 5:17:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19026)|
| 5:17:08| Well, and I guess there's a certain amount of commissioners that are very passionate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19028)|
| 5:17:13| about this particular project just because we took a lot of grief from the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19033)|
| 5:17:18| because we did move forward with the sale of the A.J. building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19038)|
| 5:17:23| But if this body wants to delay something until April, I'll call in line with that as well then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19043)|
| 5:17:32| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19052)|
| 5:17:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19054)|
| 5:17:36| Are there additional questions for item number 44?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19056)|
| 5:17:42| I'll just quickly chime in that I'd love to have more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19062)|
| 5:17:45| So I'm okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19065)|
| 5:17:47| I'll be supporting this because I'd like to, you know, see this process through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19067)|
| 5:17:50| I'd like to have all the information possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19070)|
| 5:17:52| And certainly don't want to stop right before the finish line just because I think it's good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19072)|
| 5:18:00| for us to really understand what is all the options before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19080)|
| 5:18:04| And this has been a long process for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19084)|
| 5:18:06| Commissioner Biggs, I see you jump in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19086)|
| 5:18:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19089)|
| 5:18:10| If not April, then what after April?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19090)|
| 5:18:13| Is there any other data that we'll be getting at that time if they don't meet the April deadline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19093)|
| 5:18:20| Yeah, Commissioner Biggs, I was I'm still hoping that we'll have it to you for March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19100)|
| 5:18:25| Chris and I talked about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19105)|
| 5:18:27| We just we thought April was just extra safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19107)|
| 5:18:29| We're still I'm pushing them to have it to you for your March agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19109)|
| 5:18:34| If we can't have it done to you for April, then I think we need to all go home and be ashamed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19114)|

| 5:18:50| Y'all had some great conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19130)|
| 5:18:52| I do think even whether you're pro against the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19132)|
| 5:18:56| even if you decide later on that you want to put it out for RFP again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19136)|
| 5:19:00| I think you'll find this information really helpful to you all in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19140)|
| 5:19:04| whether you're going to even need to offer a pilot for this redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19144)|
| 5:19:07| And so given they've already paid the fee and we're probably about 40 percent done with the report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19147)|
| 5:19:13| I think that it could be some real helpful information to you guys to understand the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19153)|
| 5:19:17| economics of the old A.J. building and what it's going to cost to redevelop it and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19157)|
| 5:19:21| whether some type of incentive is going to be needed at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19161)|
| 5:19:24| I mean, I don't think this will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19164)|
| 5:19:26| But if they come back and look at the numbers and say he doesn't need an incentive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19166)|
| 5:19:30| I think we'll all be very happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19170)|

| 5:19:45| Just one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19185)|
| 5:19:47| Doesn't this property already come with some sort of a tax advantage to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19187)|
| 5:19:55| Well, this property right now is off the tax rolls because it's owned by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19195)|
| 5:19:59| But if it was just sold to the developer without any benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19199)|
| 5:20:04| it would not come with any sort of property tax advantage or sales tax advantage of any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19204)|
| 5:20:09| kind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19209)|
| 5:20:09| It is in the Opportunity Zone, which helps him raise capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19209)|
| 5:20:13| But that's a federal tax benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19213)|
| 5:20:15| There is no local or state tax benefit that comes with it at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19215)|
| 5:20:20| But they do have an advantage to it without anything at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19220)|
| 5:20:24| They do have the Opportunity Zone benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19224)|
| 5:20:26| Yes, you're right, Commissioner Busser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222?start=19226)|
