| 2:32:05| or issue a grading permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9125)|
| 2:32:08| So, I mean, you know, we can always do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9128)|
| 2:32:11| I mean, I think sometimes we could have a little more staff in the building code's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9131)|
| 2:32:16| but what we have done is we've got plans reviewers that are cross-trained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9136)|
| 2:32:21| and then when we do get in a bind, we can send those guys out to do some of the inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9141)|
| 2:32:25| So, right off the top of my head, I can't think of anything that â€“| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9145)|
| 2:32:31| additional resources that we would need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9151)|
| 2:32:34| but we certainly welcome any kind of improvement that we can identify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9154)|
| 2:32:40| through these conversations with the home builders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9160)|
| 2:32:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9162)|
| 2:32:45| Thank you. Commissioner Ward, I'll throw it back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9165)|
| 2:32:47| Just one last note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9167)|
| 2:32:49| I think one of the things that Brian hit on, which is also something I've talked about in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9169)|
| 2:32:53| is if builders want to apply for a zoning concept review at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9173)|
| 2:33:00| is there a way that we can make a certain path for those builders that want to take that approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9180)|
| 2:33:05| to kind of speed along the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9185)|
| 2:33:07| Because a lot of times it goes, all right, we need zoning change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9187)|
| 2:33:12| It has to go up to commission and come back down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9192)|
| 2:33:14| They have to do a concept change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9194)|
| 2:33:15| It has to go all the way up and back down again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9195)|
| 2:33:17| Is there maybe a third path where we can say, hey, I'm fairly confident in what I want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9197)|
| 2:33:23| and this zoning change, can I submit everything here at once and get it approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9203)|
| 2:33:28| So when it comes to commission, the zoning gets approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9208)|
| 2:33:30| the concept is already approved, and we can kind of push forward from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9210)|
| 2:33:32| I think some of the commissioners that don't have the background in construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9212)|
| 2:33:37| like to know what the concept is at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9217)|
| 2:33:40| what they're actually approving that's going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9220)|
| 2:33:42| and that might sometimes help some of the conversations that are here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9222)|
| 2:33:45| what we're actually getting as a community as the finished product, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9225)|
| 2:33:50| Sure, and one of the things we see oftentimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9230)|
| 2:33:53| because Amy with planning and I were talking about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9233)|
| 2:33:55| is really the only residential zone you see applied for at this body through rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9235)|
| 2:34:00| is the planned residential zone, which, you know, as part of this land use plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9240)|
| 2:34:05| we'd like to kind of create potentially different residential zones because the PR zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9245)|
| 2:34:10| you have to go back for that concept and use on review, so there is additional steps there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9250)|
| 2:34:14| So there is some potential that we could look at some different residential zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9254)|
| 2:34:19| as part of the comprehensive plan update that might, to your point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9259)|
| 2:34:23| somewhat run some of those things concurrently to where you could save some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9263)|
| 2:34:27| Because we're talking about maybe an extra two months just to go through that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9267)|
| 2:34:32| two to three months sometimes, which is two to three months you're carrying a piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9272)|
| 2:34:36| you're waiting to close on a contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9276)|
| 2:34:38| and now you're two to three months behind on supply chain and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9278)|
| 2:34:41| So that was my thought, that that would actually speed up the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9281)|
| 2:34:46| Agreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9286)|
| 2:34:47| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9287)|
| 2:34:49| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9289)|
| 2:34:50| Commissioner Busler and then Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9290)|
| 2:34:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9292)|
| 2:34:53| Ashley, I need to ask you a question here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9293)|
| 2:34:56| It's been such a long time since I was in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9296)|
| 2:34:59| but one time we worked to make sure that we had a problem with getting inspections out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9299)|
| 2:35:05| but I thought we worked out a deal where we'd pay a little extra for the inspections to that many,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9305)|
| 2:35:11| many years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9311)|
| 2:35:13| Did that ever come about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9313)|
| 2:35:17| Commissioner Busler, I'm not sure I remember that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9317)|
| 2:35:23| That may have been before my time when Catherine was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9323)|
| 2:35:25| Ms. Lewis was my predecessor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9325)|
| 2:35:26| It may have been because it was a long time ago that we were talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9326)|
| 2:35:30| that they could not get enough inspectors out because of the pay grade and things of that sort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9330)|
| 2:35:36| and I thought we worked out something through the homebuilders that the homebuilders would pay a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9336)|
| 2:35:41| I didn't know if that ever went through or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9341)|
| 2:35:43| There is a good chance of that, and a lot of our builders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9343)|
| 2:35:47| especially the ones that are considered production builders, they have a lot going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9347)|
| 2:35:50| I know they're not always opposed to paying that small extra fee to make something happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9350)|
| 2:35:55| I don't know if they talked about having a dedicated inspector for certain areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9355)|
| 2:35:59| I do think they rotate them, but I'm not that familiar with your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9359)|
| 2:36:04| I thought that one time we said it at a meeting one time and hashed that out and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9364)|
| 2:36:09| yes, they would be glad to pay for that additional one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9369)|
| 2:36:11| I didn't know if that ever went through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9371)|
| 2:36:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9373)|
| 2:36:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9374)|
| 2:36:15| I can check on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9375)|
| 2:36:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9376)|
| 2:36:17| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9377)|
| 2:36:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9378)|
| 2:36:22| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9382)|
| 2:36:24| I definitely agree how helpful it would be to see a concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9384)|
| 2:36:30| especially when we're looking at rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9390)|
| 2:36:33| I'd like your comment, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9393)|
| 2:36:35| A few of your colleagues that I've talked to about that have indicated that the cost involved in developing a concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9395)|
| 2:36:43| sometimes not knowing for sure if zoning or even a sale is going to happen can be a tough balancing act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9403)|
| 2:36:53| Can you address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9413)|
| 2:36:54| Yes, and I think that's a valid point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9414)|
| 2:36:56| Being a requirement and being an option, I think, solves that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9416)|
| 2:37:01| You know what I mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9421)|
| 2:37:02| It is a path to those that wish to take the expenses early, that are confident in their ability to do projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9422)|
| 2:37:09| For instance, we've done so many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9429)|
| 2:37:10| Sometimes we're building two subdivisions in between two subdivisions we already built five or ten years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9430)|
| 2:37:17| or zoning that we've achieved there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9437)|
| 2:37:19| So I think having options but clear paths to accomplishing these things is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9439)|
| 2:37:25| And I failed to mention one more thing that I just wanted to say, that what's happening in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9445)|
| 2:37:31| and I'm in the business of housing, like it's good for us being a builder here, but I live here, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9451)|
| 2:37:39| and I have employees that cannot live where they want to live in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9459)|
| 2:37:44| It's not all just a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9464)|
| 2:37:48| I think it's kind of ridiculous how crazy it's been, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9468)|
| 2:37:51| But I can tell you this, that it's not going to be easy for any of you or any public to come out to these meetings anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9471)|
| 2:37:58| Growth has happened in every city, and the southeast is under a microscope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9478)|
| 2:38:02| So is the southwest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9482)|
| 2:38:03| But this is where people are coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9483)|
| 2:38:05| We are going to continue to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9485)|
| 2:38:07| You're going to continue to hear about this for a long, long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9487)|
| 2:38:10| and people are going to be very upset about schools and traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9490)|
| 2:38:15| And it's happened in every community it's ever grown in the history of growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9495)|
| 2:38:20| And I just ask, you know, everybody that's hearing this and even on the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9500)|
| 2:38:24| just like let's make wise decisions for the future of our city, regardless of how they impact one person or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9504)|
| 2:38:31| But if we want to solve this crisis that we're having with housing and the rest of the country is working on it, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9511)|
| 2:38:36| we've got to allow for flexible zoning and density where it makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9516)|
| 2:38:43| And I just want everyone to know to hang on tight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9523)|
| 2:38:45| This is going to be hard for the public to swallow, but this community is growing fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9525)|
| 2:38:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9530)|
| 2:38:55| I see no other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9535)|
| 2:38:56| Are we good, Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9536)|
| 2:38:57| Thank you, gentlemen, very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9537)|
| 2:39:00| We have reached the end of our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9540)|
| 2:39:02| Is there any other business to come before the county commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9542)|
| 2:39:07| I have a motion to second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9547)|
| 2:39:08| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9548)|
| 2:39:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9549)|
| 2:39:10| We're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9550)|
| 2:39:11| Zoning will begin at 7 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9551)|
| 2:39:16| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9556)|

| 2:43:50| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9830)|
| 2:43:51| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9831)|
| 2:43:52| I appreciate you calling and giving me some information on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9832)|
| 2:43:57| I do need some clarification, and I don't know if it should come from you or Ms. Brooks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9837)|
| 2:44:04| on the original ask was for 7 per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9844)|
| 2:44:10| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9850)|
| 2:44:11| And then the Planning Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9851)|
| 2:44:13| I can speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9853)|
| 2:44:14| Granted 12?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9854)|
| 2:44:15| Yeah, no, the original ask, the application was for 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9855)|
| 2:44:21| The request was for 12 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9861)|
| 2:44:23| I think where some of the confusion came in is the staff report, and Ms. Brooks can certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9863)|
| 2:44:27| speak to this, but the staff report initially came in at 7 units per acre was going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9867)|
| 2:44:35| the staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9875)|
| 2:44:36| But there was a bit of a breakdown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9876)|
| 2:44:38| Breakdown is not the right word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9878)|
| 2:44:40| There was a lag in some information that the staff was looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9880)|
| 2:44:46| They're doing the whole Schott Road extension we were talking about earlier, I think, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9886)|
| 2:44:51| $45 million phase two and three of the Schott Road extension affects this property, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9891)|
| 2:44:57| it elevates Ball Camp Road by 15 or 16 feet in front of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9897)|
| 2:45:04| What they had seen was a 19% grade driveway coming off of the new road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9904)|
| 2:45:12| Right, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9912)|
| 2:45:14| So staff was saying, okay, we think it should be held to a lower density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9914)|
| 2:45:18| But in between there, we were able to get the civil engineer to work a grading plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9918)|
| 2:45:23| off of the new road and reduce that 19% grade to a 5% grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9923)|
| 2:45:29| So once we got that all straightened out, everybody was comfortable with the 12 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9929)|
| 2:45:34| an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9934)|
| 2:45:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9936)|
| 2:45:37| Hold on a second here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9937)|
| 2:45:47| Mr. Snowden, did you have input on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9947)|
| 2:45:51| John, or Mr. Cuber, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9951)|
| 2:45:55| He states that very accurately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9955)|
| 2:45:57| We did, when Amy and my staff recently talked, there was a site plan that showed a driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9957)|
| 2:46:04| much closer to the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9964)|
| 2:46:07| John's engineer revised that to push it downstream of that, and it did get into a much better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9967)|
| 2:46:13| configuration for the driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9973)|
| 2:46:15| So my staff was comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9975)|
| 2:46:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9978)|
| 2:46:19| And just to confirm, these are townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9979)|
| 2:46:24| They're going to be two stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9984)|
| 2:46:26| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9986)|
| 2:46:27| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9987)|
| 2:46:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9988)|

| 2:46:52| Yes, that is this parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10012)|
| 2:46:53| Yeah, maybe on this it's maybe more of a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10013)|
| 2:46:56| It's kind of purplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10016)|
| 2:46:57| Purple, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10017)|
| 2:46:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10018)|
| 2:46:59| That's the 1.7 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10019)|
| 2:47:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10020)|
| 2:47:01| And basically, the staff recommendation, just because the housing units on Wisteria Lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10021)|
| 2:47:08| were seven, that's why the staff recommended seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10028)|
| 2:47:12| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10032)|
| 2:47:13| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10033)|
| 2:47:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10034)|
| 2:47:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10035)|
| 2:47:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10036)|

| 2:47:19| I see no other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10039)|
| 2:47:22| Chair will look to a motion on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10042)|
| 2:47:30| I'd like to make a motion that we accept Planning Commission recommendation approval at 12 per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10050)|

| 2:47:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10058)|
| 2:47:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10059)|
| 2:47:40| I have a motion by Commissioner Hill with a second by Commissioner Biggs to approve for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10060)|
| 2:47:46| the Planning Commission recommendation of 12 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10066)|
| 2:47:49| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10069)|
| 2:47:52| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10072)|
| 2:47:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10074)|
| 2:47:55| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10075)|
| 2:47:56| That item passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10076)|

| 2:48:29| Troutman Lane, parcel ID 105AA-017-002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10109)|
| 2:48:36| This is in the 6th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10116)|
| 2:48:39| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10119)|
| 2:48:40| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10120)|
| 2:48:41| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10121)|
| 2:48:42| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street, here for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10122)|
| 2:48:45| Thank you, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10125)|
| 2:48:46| Is there any opposition to this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10126)|
| 2:48:49| Seeing none, I'll look to Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10129)|
| 2:48:53| Planning Commission recommends that County Commission approve the sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10133)|
| 2:48:56| to MDR, medium-density residential, and HP hillside protection, HP for 8531 Troutman Lane only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10136)|
| 2:49:03| because of the need for more housing in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10143)|
| 2:49:07| Thank you, Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10147)|
| 2:49:08| Mr. Mullins, any comments on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10148)|
| 2:49:10| Yeah, briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10150)|
| 2:49:12| We recognize that staff's recommendation initially was to not approve the medium-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10152)|
| 2:49:18| and there was quite a bit of conversation at the Planning Commission about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10158)|
| 2:49:22| So I think I can go ahead and address that, and if there's any questions, maybe we can answer those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10162)|
| 2:49:28| I have representatives of Turner Homes here, Mr. Stephon Clark and Randy Corlew, who's our engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10168)|
| 2:49:35| I also have Mr. Buckner, I think, back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10175)|
| 2:49:37| He's the property owner on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10177)|
| 2:49:40| As you know, Turner Homes is a local developer with an established track record of doing good developments in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10180)|
| 2:49:48| They have looked at this property with the intent of doing a mixed residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10188)|
| 2:49:55| The majority of the homes are going to be attached townhomes, approximately 1,400 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10195)|
| 2:50:02| Some of them are going to be one-story, some of them will be two-story, but it's going to be a mix of that type of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10202)|
| 2:50:07| And then along Troutman Lane, when you get to the south of the property, there's some hillside protection areas there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10207)|
| 2:50:13| And so what they elected to do there was to do three single-family detached homes with individual driveway access onto Troutman Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10213)|
| 2:50:22| There's not going to be any cross-connectivity from Troutman Lane into the townhome portion of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10222)|
| 2:50:29| The exclusive access will be there on Andes Road at the northeast corner adjacent to the, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10229)|
| 2:50:37| Crisps Crossing, the townhome development that's already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10237)|
| 2:50:43| The townhome development, Crisps Crossing, it already has a sector plan amendment on it for medium-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10243)|
| 2:50:51| It is zoned planned residential at seven units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10251)|
| 2:50:54| It's built out fairly close to seven units an acre as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10254)|
| 2:50:58| And so I think the planning commission saw this as an extension of the existing medium-density residential that is to the north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10258)|
| 2:51:06| and in consideration of the unprecedented population growth that we have in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10266)|
| 2:51:12| the fact that this is the only real piece of developable land south of the planned intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10272)|
| 2:51:19| between the Shod Road Improvement and Andes Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10279)|
| 2:51:23| They looked at this as almost like an infill-type development where this missing middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10283)|
| 2:51:28| the slight touch density, I think Mr. Hansen's sale talked about it last week during his presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10288)|
| 2:51:35| It would make sense for that type of development that would help facilitate and foster affordable housing in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10295)|
| 2:51:43| while taking advantage of the development opportunities that the new roads and infrastructure will foster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10303)|
| 2:51:50| We've checked with Knox County Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10310)|
| 2:51:53| They don't have any issue with not having that cross-connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10313)|
| 2:51:56| And it also, there was some discussion that in addition to the $45 million improvement there at the corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10316)|
| 2:52:02| 900 feet north of this property with Andes and Shod,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10322)|
| 2:52:06| they're going to be bringing down and improving Andes Road all the way to the, I think the last,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10326)|
| 2:52:12| I think it's Norway Boulevard, I believe is the name of the street, there at Crisp's Crossing, which is only about 100 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10332)|
| 2:52:19| So they're going to be extending improvements down and widening and realigning the shoulders down Andes Road already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10339)|
| 2:52:26| just to the north of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10346)|
| 2:52:29| So with the low-density residential, we're capped at five units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10349)|
| 2:52:36| With this 14-acre piece of property, there won't be a traffic impact analysis with low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10356)|
| 2:52:41| But with a medium-density residential, we will do a traffic impact analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10361)|
| 2:52:44| We've actually already started that process following Planning Commission's recommendation for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10364)|
| 2:52:51| And that will give us an opportunity for Turner Homes to partner with the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10371)|
| 2:52:55| and extend those improvements down Andes Road to the extent that we are increasing the potential impact of the traffic there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10375)|
| 2:53:03| As the county engineering testified at the Planning Commission, they don't have any concerns with Andes Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10383)|
| 2:53:11| especially with the planned improvements, being able to manage and handle the traffic that this property is going to generate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10391)|
| 2:53:19| So when you're looking at a sector plan amendment, you only have to meet one of the four changes of condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10399)|
| 2:53:25| With the improved intersection to Schad and Andes, with the planned improvements to Andes Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10405)|
| 2:53:34| we certainly meet the first two conditions that are listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10414)|
| 2:53:37| Changes of condition warranting a land-use plan or the introduction of significant new roads or utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10417)|
| 2:53:43| that are not anticipated in the plan and make development more feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10423)|
| 2:53:47| I think we also meet the fourth criteria, which is trends in development, population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10427)|
| 2:53:52| or traffic that warrant reconsideration of the original plan proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10432)|
| 2:53:57| We know we need new housing. We know we need affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10437)|
| 2:54:00| We know we need housing that addresses different markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10440)|
| 2:54:03| Townhomes specifically cater either to first-time homebuyers, people who want to get into a home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10443)|
| 2:54:09| want to own property but maybe can't afford a larger home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10449)|
| 2:54:12| or they also cater to the opposite end of that spectrum, empty nesters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10452)|
| 2:54:15| older couples that are looking to downsize because they want less maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10455)|
| 2:54:20| So I think this type of development at this time, at this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10460)|
| 2:54:24| considering the improvements, just make the most sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10464)|
| 2:54:27| So we would ask that you follow Planning Commission's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10467)|
| 2:54:30| and amend the sector plan to medium-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10470)|
| 2:54:34| We're here if there's any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10474)|
| 2:54:35| Thank you, Mr. Mullins. Commissioner Jack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10475)|
| 2:54:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10478)|
| 2:54:39| Mr. Snowden, you concur with all that was said about Andes Road and the Shod Road expansion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10479)|
| 2:54:50| Yes, sir. I pulled up the plans of Shod Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10490)|
| 2:54:54| Mr. Mullins is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10494)|
| 2:54:55| We are widening Shod Road back from the new intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10495)|
| 2:54:59| which the new intersection is off alignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10499)|
| 2:55:01| It's between Chips Crossing and Arbor Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10501)|
| 2:55:03| So we go back 700 and some feet of new roadway alignment to that intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10503)|
| 2:55:09| and obviously if they perform a traffic impact study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10509)|
| 2:55:12| we'll identify any additional improvements that they may need to be responsible for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10512)|
| 2:55:17| on top of those improvements that the contractor is currently underway making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10517)|
| 2:55:22| Mr. Mullins, is this development planning on coming out onto Troutman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10522)|
| 2:55:27| Only three homes with individual driveways will have access to Troutman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=10527)|
