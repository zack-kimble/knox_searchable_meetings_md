| 0:04:27| Now is the time on our agenda for the administrative hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=267)|
| 0:04:32| Woodsmith Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=272)|
| 0:04:41| You're here tonight because you've had two violations for underage sales and present us with a plan of how you intend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=281)|
| 0:04:49| on preventing that from happening in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=289)|
| 0:04:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=292)|
| 0:04:53| You need my name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=293)|
| 0:04:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=294)|
| 0:04:55| Randy Smith, 3300 McCamey Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=295)|
| 0:05:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=301)|
| 0:05:02| We've been in business for 26 years, and until recently we haven't had any violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=302)|
| 0:05:08| We have met with our employees, gone over the procedures of how they are supposed to look at an ID, the information they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=308)|
| 0:05:14| supposed to get off of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=314)|
| 0:05:16| And in addition to that, we have purchased an ID scanner, an ID Vision Z22 countertop scanner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=316)|
| 0:05:24| This is a digital scanner that will read 48 states license, the magnetic strip on the back of it, and the military IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=324)|
| 0:05:35| We have trained our employees to look at the IDs, check the dates, the visual of the face,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=335)|
| 0:05:43| and then to scan the card and to cross-check it with the number on the driver's license and the picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=343)|
| 0:05:54| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=354)|
| 0:05:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=355)|
| 0:05:56| Mr. Smith, we have a law that says you have to see an ID from everybody you sell beer to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=356)|
| 0:06:03| You're familiar with that law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=363)|
| 0:06:04| Yes, we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=364)|
| 0:06:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=365)|
| 0:06:06| Now, I can see you all have got two offenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=366)|
| 0:06:08| On one of those, you all didn't even ask the person for their ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=368)|
| 0:06:13| Now, while the systems you've got are really good, they all require somebody to take that step and get the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=373)|
| 0:06:18| I mean, the cards are great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=378)|
| 0:06:21| I'm always worried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=381)|
| 0:06:22| I will eventually make a motion to send you to administrative hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=382)|
| 0:06:25| I always do that when people have not been checking your IDs because it doesn't work if you don't check the IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=385)|
| 0:06:35| We also have a security system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=395)|
| 0:06:37| We've told our employees that we will be regularly going through the video,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=397)|
| 0:06:41| and anyone selling beer without scanning the ID will be terminated immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=401)|
| 0:06:47| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=407)|
| 0:06:49| And the ID scanner is a new element of your system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=409)|
| 0:06:55| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=415)|
| 0:06:56| After the two underage sales?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=416)|
| 0:06:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=418)|
| 0:06:59| The second violation, we had an employee that just calculated wrong in their head the age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=419)|
| 0:07:06| and we bought that to try to layer technology on top to try to cover inaccuracies in human error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=426)|
| 0:07:13| What did you do after the first offense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=433)|
| 0:07:15| After the first, we met with everybody, had them come to two or three meetings, and showed them how to read an ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=435)|
| 0:07:24| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=444)|
| 0:07:28| Councilman Fevella.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=448)|
| 0:07:30| My question was, how were the employees who were responsible for the citations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=450)|
| 0:07:36| how were they dealt with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=456)|
| 0:07:37| Are they still employed by you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=457)|
| 0:07:39| Well, the first one was suspended for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=459)|
| 0:07:43| The second one was actually one of the owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=463)|
| 0:07:45| She's an elderly lady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=465)|
| 0:07:49| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=469)|
| 0:07:51| And so?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=471)|
| 0:07:55| You can't fire the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=475)|
| 0:07:57| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=477)|
| 0:07:58| I didn't understand you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=478)|
| 0:08:00| One of the owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=480)|
| 0:08:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=481)|
| 0:08:11| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=491)|
| 0:08:12| You just answered my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=492)|
| 0:08:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=493)|
| 0:08:14| Is she still?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=494)|
| 0:08:16| She doesn't run the cash register anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=496)|
| 0:08:18| Just in the deli.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=498)|
| 0:08:21| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=501)|
| 0:08:23| Well, I think we heard at one point that sometimes rather than to terminate the employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=503)|
| 0:08:28| it's sometimes better to keep them around because they've learned their lesson and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=508)|
| 0:08:31| But that's just a little something I remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=511)|
| 0:08:35| I appreciate the things you've done since the last incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=515)|
| 0:08:40| Councilman Woodhull asked you about the timing of the ID scanner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=520)|
| 0:08:46| And we purchased it within a week after the second violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=526)|
| 0:08:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| When did you implement these other processes besides buying the scanner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=538)|
| 0:09:05| After the first violation, we had a meeting within seven days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=545)|
| 0:09:08| And we had two meetings after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=548)|
| 0:09:10| And we have had no new employees since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=550)|
| 0:09:13| And we remind them we have signs everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=553)|
| 0:09:15| And we have told our employees that if you do not card everybody that comes in, scan their ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=555)|
| 0:09:22| cross-check the scan with the actual ID, if we catch them on videotape, not doing that one time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=562)|
| 0:09:28| they are terminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=568)|
| 0:09:30| And so you have videotape as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=570)|
| 0:09:32| Yes, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=572)|
| 0:09:33| How long have you had that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=573)|
| 0:09:34| We have had that for about ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=574)|
| 0:09:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=578)|
| 0:09:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=579)|
| 0:09:41| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=581)|
| 0:09:43| I'll go ahead and make a motion to send to a suspension revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=583)|
| 0:09:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=590)|
| 0:09:55| Did we get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=595)|
| 0:09:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=597)|
| 0:10:01| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=601)|
| 0:10:02| Councilman Marotti.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=602)|
| 0:10:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=604)|
| 0:10:05| Vice Mayor Becker, explain to me more about your rationale for sending this business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=605)|
| 0:10:10| I know one of the things we look for as a beer board is a very proactive stance in addressing the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=610)|
| 0:10:18| and purchasing this type of technology is something that we have asked businesses to do in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=618)|
| 0:10:24| So it would appear if all the employees are using this with regularity that they have taken a strong stand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=624)|
| 0:10:32| to address this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=632)|
| 0:10:33| Is it the frequency of the violations or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=633)|
| 0:10:37| Tell me your thought process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=637)|
| 0:10:38| Well, I think when a business is not even getting an ID, that's a sign to me that there's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=638)|
| 0:10:46| And clearly, their first violation, they didn't ask for an ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=646)|
| 0:10:51| And that wonderful piece of technology doesn't work if you don't ask for an ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=651)|
| 0:10:55| So I also sort of always do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=655)|
| 0:10:59| And I do trust the wisdom of this council to make the right decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=659)|
| 0:11:03| This is, I'll be honest, this is not one that I'm going to lose any sleep over if this gets voted down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=663)|
| 0:11:08| So I think they are making some steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=668)|
| 0:11:12| But it feels to me like when we have businesses that can't, on a routine basis, ask for an ID, we have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=672)|
| 0:11:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=679)|
| 0:11:20| But my history says on the second violation, they did ask for an ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=680)|
| 0:11:23| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=683)|
| 0:11:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=684)|
| 0:11:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=685)|
| 0:11:26| So that showed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=686)|
| 0:11:27| After they got the scanner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=687)|
| 0:11:28| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=688)|
| 0:11:29| I think that was after they got the scanner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=689)|
| 0:11:31| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=691)|
| 0:11:32| No, that was before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=692)|
| 0:11:33| No, the second violation was before we got the scanner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=693)|
| 0:11:35| She did ask for the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=695)|
| 0:11:36| She misread it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=696)|
| 0:11:38| And then my understanding from your remedial plan is that if for some reason the scanner is inoperable, then two people have to look at the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=698)|
| 0:11:47| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=707)|
| 0:11:48| Have you had a situation like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=708)|
| 0:11:49| It has not gone down yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=709)|
| 0:11:53| And you just have one cash register, so you just need one of these machines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=713)|
| 0:11:57| It's not tied to the cash register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=717)|
| 0:11:59| We have two cash registers and one machine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=719)|
| 0:12:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=722)|
| 0:12:03| And everybody knows how to use it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=723)|
| 0:12:04| Everybody has been fully trained in how to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=724)|
| 0:12:06| It's a pretty simple technology to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=726)|
| 0:12:09| I think that technology could make a big difference, and I'm impressed that the business has been willing to invest in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=729)|
| 0:12:18| Councilwoman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=738)|
| 0:12:19| Well, I would agree with the comments that Councilman Roddy has made, but I would like to ask you about the videotape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=739)|
| 0:12:28| Apparently you've had that for a long period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=748)|
| 0:12:31| But obviously maybe we're not checking it or viewing it frequently, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=751)|
| 0:12:39| In the past, we had only reviewed the videotape when we had had money missing or a crime had been committed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=759)|
| 0:12:45| So now I'm interested in what your practice is regarding viewing or reviewing the tape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=765)|
| 0:12:53| We'll sit down and look at several shifts a week, just go through them quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=773)|
| 0:13:00| And when somebody brings a beer up, watch to see if they scan and go through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=780)|
| 0:13:05| Well, that seems to me to be very important if you're going to be able to really sustain your rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=785)|
| 0:13:11| and your policies that you've put in place, because if the employees are not aware that they are being checked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=791)|
| 0:13:17| they probably will become less concerned about being responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=797)|
| 0:13:24| I feel you've made some extremely good moves toward complying, and I congratulate you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=804)|
| 0:13:33| And I just hope that this will keep your record clean in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=813)|
| 0:13:38| Ma'am, we've been in business 26 years inside a community, and to us this is a failure on our part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=818)|
| 0:13:46| I'm very familiar with your establishment, and I know it's important to that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=826)|
| 0:13:52| So I wish you well on the practices you've put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=832)|
| 0:13:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=837)|
| 0:13:58| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=838)|
| 0:14:00| One last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=840)|
| 0:14:01| How long have you had the mandatory dismissal when they don't check?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=841)|
| 0:14:06| Since we got the scanner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=846)|
| 0:14:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=848)|
| 0:14:09| Well, I appreciate Councilman Roddy and Pilo's comments, and I agree with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=849)|
| 0:14:14| And I'm going to support you, and I hope I don't see you back again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=854)|
| 0:14:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=857)|
| 0:14:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=860)|
| 0:14:21| Are we ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=861)|
| 0:14:23| This vote is to send him to a suspension revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=863)|
| 0:14:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=869)|
| 0:14:31| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=871)|
| 0:14:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=872)|
| 0:14:33| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=873)|
| 0:14:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=874)|
| 0:14:35| Councilman Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=875)|
| 0:14:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=876)|
| 0:14:37| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=877)|
| 0:14:38| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=878)|
| 0:14:39| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=879)|
| 0:14:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=880)|
| 0:14:41| Councilman Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=881)|
| 0:14:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=882)|
| 0:14:43| Councilman Pilo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=883)|
| 0:14:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=884)|
| 0:14:45| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=885)|
| 0:14:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=886)|
| 0:14:47| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=887)|
| 0:14:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=888)|
| 0:14:49| Well, that motion failed eight to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=889)|
| 0:14:53| Significant margin, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=893)|
| 0:14:54| Significant margin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=894)|
| 0:14:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=897)|
| 0:15:06| Easy stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=906)|
| 0:15:20| Good evening, gentlemen and ladies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=920)|
| 0:15:21| I'm Tommy Hunt, Chief Executive Officer of Easy Stop Food Marts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=921)|
| 0:15:25| Our corporation is based in Maryville, Tennessee, at 2128 East Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=925)|
| 0:15:29| My personal residence is 1313 Turnberry Lane in Maryville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=929)|
| 0:15:34| Well, you're here tonight because you've had several underage sales to minors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=934)|
| 0:15:39| and to present us with a plan of what you intend on doing to prevent that from happening in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=939)|
| 0:15:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=945)|
| 0:15:46| Easy Stop Food Marts operates 22 stores of which 21 have beer licenses in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=946)|
| 0:15:52| We have a training program, which Sandy Kirkpatrick administers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=952)|
| 0:15:57| All of our cashiers are trained on alcohol and tobacco sales prior to resuming responsibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=957)|
| 0:16:03| in the store for the sales before they ever take duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=963)|
| 0:16:09| We use Sandy's National Association of Convenience Stores alcohol and tobacco training tools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=969)|
| 0:16:17| as well as being TIPS, an ACT-certified trainer, and we use that training every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=977)|
| 0:16:22| All of our employees, of course, go through the city-required and county-required training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=982)|
| 0:16:26| here in the City of Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=986)|
| 0:16:30| We have an alcohol and tobacco policy review session with all employees at all stores| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=990)|
| 0:16:36| and they are required to sign that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=996)|
| 0:16:38| We have records of that for all the stores for the prior 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=998)|
| 0:16:42| We also hire an outside company that does mystery shops at various times during the month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1002)|
| 0:16:48| so they catch us different shifts at different times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1008)|
| 0:16:51| If a cashier fails one of our mystery shops, he goes back through the recertification program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1011)|
| 0:16:56| with new hires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1016)|
| 0:16:58| If he or she fails a second time, they're terminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1018)|
| 0:17:02| If an employee is convicted of the offense, they're immediately terminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1022)|
| 0:17:08| State law requires a permit holder not to employ anyone convicted of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1028)|
| 0:17:13| The first offense at Easy Stop 14, approximately 18 months ago, was a new product| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1033)|
| 0:17:19| that actually contained tomato juice that our cashier had never seen before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1039)|
| 0:17:25| and thought it was a tomato juice product, didn't realize it was alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1045)|
| 0:17:29| It was not in our price book even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1049)|
| 0:17:31| The beer wholesaler had stocked it prior to us even having it in the price book| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1051)|
| 0:17:38| and she inadvertently thought it was a tomato juice product and sold it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| She was not convicted on that citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1062)|
| 0:17:45| Second citation, the clerk overrode the prompt from the computer system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1065)|
| 0:17:49| which required her to put the ID in and made the sale after three attempts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1069)|
| 0:17:55| We have gone through with all the cashiers at that store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1075)|
| 0:17:59| as well as the manager required that new training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1079)|
| 0:18:03| We also have a new software system that we're installing and learning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1083)|
| 0:18:07| as you can imagine going all the way from retail to accounting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1087)|
| 0:18:11| that will alert us to error corrects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1091)|
| 0:18:15| and no date entries on alcohol and tobacco sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1095)|
| 0:18:21| so we can see if a cashier actually looked at the cashier performance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1101)|
| 0:18:25| and revisit with them if they are making sales from the prior day's reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1105)|
| 0:18:31| Council Member Roddick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1111)|
| 0:18:37| Mr. Hunt, I understand that the new system that you're implementing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1117)|
| 0:18:41| from retail through accounting is recent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| How many of the other controls that you discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1124)|
| 0:18:50| have they been after your second violation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1130)|
| 0:18:53| No, these are all ongoing things we've been doing for five or six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1133)|
| 0:18:56| So asking the employees to sign the confirmation of your policy monthly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1136)|
| 0:19:00| and the mystery shoppers, all that has been ongoing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1140)|
| 0:19:03| It's been at least five or six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1143)|
| 0:19:05| I have copies for this store for the prior 12 months of all of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1145)|
| 0:19:08| So the only change that you have made after the second violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1148)|
| 0:19:14| was the purchasing of this new software system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1154)|
| 0:19:17| That software is ongoing, but it gives us some additional capabilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1157)|
| 0:19:20| for control of permitted products.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1160)|
| 0:19:23| So you've had that software, but you haven't used the control aspect of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1163)|
| 0:19:26| No, the software is just newly installed in the stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1166)|
| 0:19:29| Okay, and so you plan to analyze the data results?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1169)|
| 0:19:32| It allows us to actually pull the information from the cash register| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1172)|
| 0:19:38| to a database and then scan the database by cashier, by day, and by product| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1178)|
| 0:19:45| and let us have that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| And I understand that that will be helpful to you as an employer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1187)|
| 0:19:50| to ascertain employee compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1190)|
| 0:19:53| However, it doesn't seem to me to address in any other kind of proactive way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1193)|
| 0:19:59| beer sales and tobacco sales, as you mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1199)|
| 0:20:02| but our concern is beer sales at the register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| Our existing software required an age verification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1205)|
| 0:20:10| The cashier overrode that age verification after the third request on this last sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1210)|
| 0:20:15| So on your first sale, there was no check of ID at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1215)|
| 0:20:18| No, it was an unknown UPC because the beer wholesaler put the product in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1218)|
| 0:20:23| Right, she didn't know the tomato juice product, so there was no check of ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1223)|
| 0:20:26| The second time, there was check of ID, but...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1226)|
| 0:20:29| She overrode the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1229)|
| 0:20:30| She overrode the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1230)|
| 0:20:31| So you have not started new policies, any new training with your employees, anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1231)|
| 0:20:38| Other than if it's, don't override the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1238)|
| 0:20:41| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1241)|
| 0:20:44| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1244)|
| 0:20:47| When you said in the second instance that she overrode the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1247)|
| 0:20:52| what exactly are you saying, that she was disregarding what...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1252)|
| 0:20:55| She was asking for ID, and she put the ID in and told her it was not legal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1255)|
| 0:20:58| but she thought she put it in incorrectly and made the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1258)|
| 0:21:01| She thought she had put it in incorrectly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1261)|
| 0:21:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1264)|
| 0:21:06| Now, my impression is that you think that your system is just fine the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1266)|
| 0:21:10| Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1270)|
| 0:21:13| We're not perfect, but we have passed 15 beer stings from other municipalities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1273)|
| 0:21:21| in the past year and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1281)|
| 0:21:24| We have passed them with three other stores in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1284)|
| 0:21:30| Just passed one in Alcoa last week with three stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1290)|
| 0:21:34| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1294)|
| 0:21:35| Yeah, two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1295)|
| 0:21:37| Just following up on Councilman Woodhull's question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1297)|
| 0:21:39| tell me about the system for your cash register, beer scans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1299)|
| 0:21:44| Cash register says, give me an ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1304)|
| 0:21:46| Give me an ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1306)|
| 0:21:47| So it is you type a date in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1307)|
| 0:21:49| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1309)|
| 0:21:50| And this person typed it in three times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1310)|
| 0:21:52| and thought all three times she had typed it wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1312)|
| 0:21:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1314)|
| 0:21:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1315)|
| 0:21:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1317)|
| 0:21:58| And what do you do in the future to stop that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| Training issues as far as following up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1321)|
| 0:22:03| If you're uncertain of the age, don't make the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1323)|
| 0:22:06| We have always told our cashiers if they wanted to refuse a sale for alcohol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1326)|
| 0:22:10| that we would stand behind them if they thought a person was inebriated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1330)|
| 0:22:13| if they were uncertain as to the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1333)|
| 0:22:17| If you worked in the field with retail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1337)|
| 0:22:19| our cashiers have been assaulted, slapped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1339)|
| 0:22:22| and called all sorts of names for asking for IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1342)|
| 0:22:26| That is one of the reasons why our company worked with the cities of Alcoa,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1346)|
| 0:22:31| Maryville, and Blount County to enact the ordinance after Oak Ridge initially did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1351)|
| 0:22:35| where we can say that Big Brother wants the ID, not me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1355)|
| 0:22:38| thinking that you're under 30 or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| We find that that's helped a lot in the community acceptance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1361)|
| 0:22:44| in having the ID presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1364)|
| 0:22:47| We have always told them if you've got a question about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| do not make the sale because you ultimately are the one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1369)|
| 0:22:52| that could serve a jail sentence as well as us as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| I'm going to go ahead and make a motion to send to a suspension of revocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1375)|
| 0:22:59| Again, I do trust the wisdom of the council to make the right decision on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1379)|
| 0:23:03| but it ought to be on our plate, so I'm making that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1383)|
| 0:23:06| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1388)|
| 0:23:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1389)|
| 0:23:10| I see a little difference between this one and the previous one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1390)|
| 0:23:15| First, the first triggering offense was in January of last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1395)|
| 0:23:20| and then the second one was 14 months and two days afterwards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1400)|
| 0:23:26| and the first one was actually dismissed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1406)|
| 0:23:31| You know, they do have some procedures in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1411)|
| 0:23:36| but if people are bound and determined to think that they're doing something wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1416)|
| 0:23:40| and they're going to go ahead and make the sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| I mean, technology is going to be a pretty hard thing to catch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1423)|
| 0:23:49| Even if the sale in January of 2008 had not been dismissed, that's a pretty long gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1429)|
| 0:23:57| I mean, it's within the window where you can send somebody to a suspension revocation hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1437)|
| 0:24:04| but I'm not sure I can be supportive of it in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1444)|
| 0:24:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1447)|
| 0:24:09| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1449)|
| 0:24:10| Yes, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| I agree with Councilman Frost on his remarks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1452)|
| 0:24:14| but I wanted to ask you what is the status of the employee that overrode the system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1454)|
| 0:24:20| She's terminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1460)|
| 0:24:21| She's terminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1461)|
| 0:24:22| And I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1462)|
| 0:24:23| I don't know how you deal with an employee that wants to override technology like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1463)|
| 0:24:30| And the beer, tomato juice incident, I guess, is the one that was dismissed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1470)|
| 0:24:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1475)|
| 0:24:36| And then 14 months since then, so I tend to agree with Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1476)|
| 0:24:40| The name of that product was Clamata, and it didn't look like a bud product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1480)|
| 0:24:48| It looked like a tomato juice blend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| and it was a new product that the wholesaler was not supposed to put in until the next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1490)|
| 0:24:54| so that we could go around and make education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| that this is something you're going to be checking for ID in and get it in the price book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1496)|
| 0:25:01| Well, here again, I'm going to support you, and I hope I don't see you back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1501)|
| 0:25:04| but I just want to say that anything, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1504)|
| 0:25:06| you have to keep trying to find new innovative ways to prevent this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1506)|
| 0:25:11| That's why we're spending $350,000 on this new software.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1511)|
| 0:25:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1515)|
| 0:25:17| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1517)|
| 0:25:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1518)|
| 0:25:19| I tend to find myself in agreement with Councilman Frost and Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1519)|
| 0:25:24| One of the things that we look for is the frequency and the repetition of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1524)|
| 0:25:31| how far apart the violations are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1531)|
| 0:25:35| And as was pointed out, these are pretty far apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1535)|
| 0:25:38| But the fact that the first offense was dismissed and that I take Mr. Hunt at his word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1538)|
| 0:25:44| I believe him to be an honest man,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1544)|
| 0:25:46| and the fact that it was just a freak situation where, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1546)|
| 0:25:52| they had a new product that wasn't even supposed to be on their shelves or in their coolers yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1552)|
| 0:25:56| and no one knew how to deal with it, at least not people in the front line retail-wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1556)|
| 0:26:01| And so I tend to be fairly strict on these things, but I'm not going to vote to send it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1561)|
| 0:26:09| Councilman Holquist, you may be careful about my honesty because I'm a city councilman at Maryville as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1569)|
| 0:26:14| Well, I do note that, but I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1574)|
| 0:26:18| How do you feel about guns in parks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1578)|
| 0:26:23| Councilman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1583)|
| 0:26:24| Well, of course, the fact that he's a city councilman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| and I guess we all noted that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1586)|
| 0:26:28| would indicate that we think your integrity and honesty is as pure as the driven snow because ours is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1588)|
| 0:26:36| But, no, I was a bit concerned initially just feeling that your comments were fairly blasé regarding the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1596)|
| 0:26:50| And you can see we don't take it casually at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1610)|
| 0:26:53| And we can't because we have a tremendous responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1613)|
| 0:26:56| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1616)|
| 0:26:57| But I have to agree that with the timeframe and just the peculiar nature of that first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1617)|
| 0:27:06| So your honesty is critically important based on the fact that, you know, we're going to go along with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1626)|
| 0:27:13| I was curious, though, to ask you the firing, if you will, of that employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1633)|
| 0:27:22| When did that come?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| Immediately or was there some time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1644)|
| 0:27:26| Yes, same day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1646)|
| 0:27:27| Same day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1647)|
| 0:27:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1648)|
| 0:27:31| We've got a motion and a second to send them to a suspension revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1651)|
| 0:27:36| Is there any further discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1656)|
| 0:27:39| Ms. Mitchell, will you call the roll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1659)|
| 0:27:42| Vice Mayor Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1664)|
| 0:27:45| Councilman Booker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1665)|
| 0:27:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| Councilman Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1667)|
| 0:27:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1668)|
| 0:27:49| Councilman Hall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1669)|
| 0:27:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1670)|
| 0:27:51| Councilman Hultquist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1671)|
| 0:27:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1672)|
| 0:27:53| Councilman Pelo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1673)|
| 0:27:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1674)|
| 0:27:55| Councilman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1675)|
| 0:27:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1676)|
| 0:27:57| Councilman Woodhull?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1677)|
| 0:27:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1678)|
| 0:27:59| Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1679)|
| 0:28:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1680)|
| 0:28:01| That motion fails eight to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| You're on a roll, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1683)|
| 0:28:05| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1685)|
| 0:28:08| Magnolia Minimart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1688)|
| 0:28:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1691)|
| 0:28:14| My theory is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1694)|

| 0:28:20| Magnolia Minimart, 2400 East Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1700)|
| 0:28:24| I'm sorry, could you speak up just a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1704)|
| 0:28:28| Magnolia Minimart, 2400 East Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1708)|
| 0:28:34| 2400 East Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| Councilman Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1718)|
| 0:28:39| I'm going to make a motion to postpone this for our next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1719)|
| 0:28:42| beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1722)|
| 0:28:43| Apparently, KPD has some other issues with this location that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1723)|
| 0:28:47| we should probably be aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1727)|
| 0:28:50| And I think there's some legal reasons to not consider this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1733)|
| 0:28:54| So, I'm going to make a motion to postpone and see how that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1734)|
| 0:28:56| flies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1736)|
| 0:28:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1737)|
| 0:28:58| Councilman Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1738)|
| 0:28:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1739)|
| 0:29:00| I was going to substitute motion to the next beer board meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1740)|
| 0:29:04| where there...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1744)|
| 0:29:05| Regularly scheduled beer board meeting where there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1745)|
| 0:29:07| administrative hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1747)|
| 0:29:09| That's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1749)|
| 0:29:10| I will accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1750)|
| 0:29:11| That's very wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1751)|
| 0:29:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1752)|
| 0:29:13| Councilman Holquist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1753)|
| 0:29:15| Do you need to elaborate any more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1755)|
| 0:29:19| It hasn't done me any good so far tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1759)|
| 0:29:21| So...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1761)|
| 0:29:22| We have Officer Husky here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1762)|
| 0:29:25| I was just going to ask Officer Husky if you wanted to comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1765)|
| 0:29:28| for our benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1768)|
| 0:29:29| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1769)|
| 0:29:30| Just as early as today, we've come across some additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1770)|
| 0:29:33| violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1773)|
| 0:29:34| And we're still investigating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1774)|
| 0:29:35| We will be asking for a hearing through the law department and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1775)|
| 0:29:39| from a hearing officer in the very near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| So, we would ask that we hear all the violations at that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1781)|
| 0:29:44| and we'll be serving them in the very near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1784)|
| 0:29:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1788)|
| 0:29:49| Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1789)|
| 0:29:50| Mr. Swanson, is what we've heard relevant to what's before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1790)|
| 0:29:57| It's not relevant to what's before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1797)|
| 0:29:59| But it makes sense if they're going to go to a suspension or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1799)|
| 0:30:03| revocation hearing anyway based on additional charges that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| occurred since this last event that you not take the time with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1806)|
| 0:30:12| an administrative hearing here but postpone it and allow the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1812)|
| 0:30:15| department to file those charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| If they don't, then it should come back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1817)|
| 0:30:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1819)|
| 0:30:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1820)|
| 0:30:21| Any further discussion on the postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1821)|
| 0:30:27| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1829)|
| 0:30:30| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1830)|
| 0:30:31| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1831)|
| 0:30:32| Do you understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1832)|
| 0:30:33| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1833)|
| 0:30:36| Smoky Sports Pub and Bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1836)|
| 0:30:52| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1852)|
| 0:30:53| Michelle Mapstone, Smoky Sports Pub and Bar, 2613 West Adair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1853)|
| 0:30:57| Knoxville, Tennessee, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1857)|
| 0:31:00| You're here tonight because you've had 200 sales to minors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1860)|
| 0:31:05| and to present us with a plan of what you intend to do to prevent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1865)|
| 0:31:09| that from happening in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1869)|
| 0:31:12| Well, I've had a policy in place since 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1872)|
| 0:31:18| It's rather simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| If in doubt, throw them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1880)|
| 0:31:21| This means if they walk through the door and they look unsavory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| intoxicated, or suspicious in any manner, do not allow them in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1884)|
| 0:31:27| pub or serve them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1887)|
| 0:31:29| It means do not check their ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| Just ask them to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1891)|
| 0:31:32| As we have a policy in the pub that states that we have a right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1892)|
| 0:31:35| for free service to anyone, no reason required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1895)|
| 0:31:38| All individuals, regardless of age, are to be carded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1898)|
| 0:31:41| A current valid ID is required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1901)|
| 0:31:44| Not only are you to check the date, the year of birth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1904)|
| 0:31:47| you are to check the month and date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1907)|
| 0:31:50| If it's someone's 21st birthday, you do have the right to tell him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1910)|
| 0:31:53| or her to come back tomorrow as we do not know the time of their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1913)|
| 0:31:56| birth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1916)|
| 0:31:57| We'll probably be asking the question since I wonder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| about it myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1919)|
| 0:32:00| There will be no grace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1920)|
| 0:32:01| Anyone serving an individual under 21 will be terminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1921)|
| 0:32:05| This issue should never have to be addressed because the rule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1925)|
| 0:32:08| number one will not allow for this situation to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1928)|
| 0:32:12| Individuals coming into the pub wanting to sell items to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1932)|
| 0:32:15| customers, this is not related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| It's not relevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1937)|
| 0:32:18| It was on meat days and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1938)|
| 0:32:24| Additionally, we normally have signs that are posted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1944)|
| 0:32:27| 21 and up, no exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| The window cleaners have a tendency to take them down and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1949)|
| 0:32:32| keep putting them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1952)|
| 0:32:33| I have a new one that says, thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| management and the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1956)|
| 0:32:39| There is no one that enters that pub that should not be carded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1959)|
| 0:32:43| The incident on July 2nd with Gidget Lamar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1963)|
| 0:32:50| she has been terminated and I don't know how to phrase this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1970)|
| 0:32:56| I guess she wasn't the brightest light bulb in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1976)|
| 0:32:59| The person's birth date was either 10-28 or 10-23 and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1979)|
| 0:33:09| license was 2009 and when she looked at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1989)|
| 0:33:12| 2009 she neglected to look at the date of birth and the month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1992)|
| 0:33:16| of birth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1996)|
| 0:33:17| And the young man was 20 years old instead of 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=1997)|
| 0:33:23| I have not had that much turnover in the pub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2003)|
| 0:33:28| There are three individuals that have been there for quite a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2008)|
| 0:33:30| while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2010)|
| 0:33:31| I have a new person in staff who is very good at what she does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2011)|
| 0:33:43| She's like me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2023)|
| 0:33:44| She takes the ID and the thing about it is if in doubt you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2024)|
| 0:33:47| throw them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2027)|
| 0:33:48| It doesn't make any difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2028)|
| 0:33:49| If I look at you and for whatever reason I don't feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2029)|
| 0:33:51| like it's right, you've got to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| That's all there is to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2033)|
| 0:33:54| And like someone said earlier, you sure can get cussed by not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2034)|
| 0:33:57| serving someone a beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2037)|
| 0:33:58| But what transpired should have never happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2038)|
| 0:34:04| But it did and I love my pub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2044)|
| 0:34:09| I don't want us to tell this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2049)|
| 0:34:15| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2055)|
| 0:34:16| Ma'am, tell me, do you ID people at the door?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2056)|
| 0:34:20| No, we ID people when they enter the pub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2060)|
| 0:34:24| When they come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| They have entered the door, they come in to the pub,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2067)|
| 0:34:31| they step up to the bar and that is when they are ID'd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2071)|
| 0:34:35| Or if you look up and it looks like someone is too young,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| you just ask them to leave, period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| before they walk any further into the pub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2080)|
| 0:34:44| So you are asked to ID when you enter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2084)|
| 0:34:49| So everybody who comes in is going to be asked for an ID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2089)|
| 0:34:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2093)|
| 0:34:54| Regardless of age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2094)|
| 0:34:55| It doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2095)|
| 0:34:56| And how long has that been the policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| Since 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2098)|
| 0:34:59| I've had the pub a little over six and a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2099)|
| 0:35:04| And you got two violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| Yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2107)|
| 0:35:08| It was the first day of someone's employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| And they got busted that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2110)|
| 0:35:13| And they didn't last very long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| What's different between what you were doing before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2115)|
| 0:35:21| the first one was on April 21st of 08.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2121)|
| 0:35:27| What's different from April 20th of 08 before that first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2127)|
| 0:35:30| violation and now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2130)|
| 0:35:31| What are you doing different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2131)|
| 0:35:34| Oh, Lord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2134)|
| 0:35:36| I've looked at some systems like other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| And right now I'm trying to decide which one is the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2140)|
| 0:35:41| And not to put the pub out of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2141)|
| 0:35:43| Purchasing technology and not putting the pub out of business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2143)|
| 0:35:47| by someone not knowing how to subtract or add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2147)|
| 0:35:56| The only thing I can tell you is that I've met with my employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2156)|
| 0:35:59| and told them, guys, you know, this is very serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2159)|
| 0:36:02| We have to be very cognizant in what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2162)|
| 0:36:05| We have to make sure that we can add and subtract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2165)|
| 0:36:08| We have to make sure that someone is 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2168)|
| 0:36:11| I am in the process of looking at technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2171)|
| 0:36:16| And it is very pricey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2176)|
| 0:36:17| And I understand that we have to spend money to make money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2177)|
| 0:36:21| and to stay in business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| But same token, sometimes these things are so huge that if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2183)|
| 0:36:27| do it, you put yourself in harm's way in another way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| All I can say is that I am looking at other options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2190)|
| 0:36:37| But right now, I'm on their feathers all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2197)|
| 0:36:41| Guys, check their ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| Make sure they're doing, you know, just keep doing what we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2203)|
| 0:36:47| been doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| And it just takes one moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2209)|
| 0:36:52| I'm already for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2212)|
| 0:36:57| It just takes one moment of memory lapse for the wrong thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2217)|
| 0:37:04| to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2224)|
| 0:37:07| And both times, this is transfer, which is not good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2227)|
| 0:37:11| It's been with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2231)|
| 0:37:14| And because I get IDs all the time where they've expired in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2234)|
| 0:37:18| 2006 or whatever, and I refuse service to those individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2238)|
| 0:37:21| because state law requires that it has to be a current valid ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2241)|
| 0:37:25| Ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2245)|
| 0:37:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2248)|
| 0:37:30| I'm just a little bit confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| And I understand that you are concerned about your pub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2252)|
| 0:37:36| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| And I know you don't want to have to see separation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2258)|
| 0:37:42| But I'm a little bit concerned that everyone really understands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2262)|
| 0:37:46| your policy because I really don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2266)|
| 0:37:49| Now, at one point, someone is watching the news and they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2269)|
| 0:37:53| IDing people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2273)|
| 0:37:56| That's what I understood you to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| And then a moment later, you stated that you ID them at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2279)|
| 0:38:03| bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| But in between, you had stated that they are asked to leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2285)|
| 0:38:09| before they get to the bar if they don't look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2289)|
| 0:38:13| So I'm not sure if I were one of your employees that I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2293)|
| 0:38:17| understand where my responsibility is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2297)|
| 0:38:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2300)|
| 0:38:22| The responsibility, and I'm sorry if I confused anyone here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2302)|
| 0:38:26| We have, say, street people who will come to the front door and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2306)|
| 0:38:30| open the door to see who's in there, and they will ask people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| for money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| So as soon as that person walks in the door, we already know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2318)|
| 0:38:42| that is someone we do not want in the pub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2322)|
| 0:38:46| I do understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2328)|
| 0:38:50| So we ask them to leave before they ever ask for a beer or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2330)|
| 0:38:54| anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| They're gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2336)|
| 0:38:58| I mean, that's the end of the story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2338)|
| 0:39:00| You're gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2340)|
| 0:39:02| It doesn't make any difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| Or if you bring in what looks like stolen merchandise, they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2346)|
| 0:39:08| So that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| And if someone walks in and they look like they're 16 years old, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2350)|
| 0:39:12| don't care how old, you just need to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2352)|
| 0:39:14| If you walk into the pub, up to the bar, or if you're sitting at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2354)|
| 0:39:18| a table, each person that works there cards each person who is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2358)|
| 0:39:24| sitting and ordering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2364)|
| 0:39:26| If there is one person that walks into that pub that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2366)|
| 0:39:28| underage, they are all asked to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| If they have, if there's one person who has an ID that is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2370)|
| 0:39:36| current, they have the options of leaving as a group or that one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2376)|
| 0:39:42| individual is not served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2382)|
| 0:39:44| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| I just don't believe I do understand your hesitancy to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2386)|
| 0:39:50| employ some technology to assist your employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2390)|
| 0:39:54| There is no actual hesitancy in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| It's just I am looking at probably not what you guys would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2398)|
| 0:40:02| consider a whole lot of money, but it is a lot of money to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2402)|
| 0:40:06| pub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2406)|
| 0:40:08| And I have looked at several systems that we could purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2408)|
| 0:40:12| as well as a new cash register that has the capability of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2412)|
| 0:40:16| swiping the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2416)|
| 0:40:18| I'll just make one observation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2418)|
| 0:40:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| I believe that the second sale to a minor was in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2422)|
| 0:40:26| Yes, it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2426)|
| 0:40:28| We are just about to end the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| So that is just about five and a half months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2430)|
| 0:40:34| And it concerns me that decisions haven't been made and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2434)|
| 0:40:38| something has not occurred that is going to change the way in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2438)|
| 0:40:42| which you are able to operate the pub so you can keep it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2442)|
| 0:40:46| going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| That's just my personal observation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2450)|
| 0:40:52| Well, one thing I was not aware of, when this happened in July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2452)|
| 0:40:56| I called and asked what the ramifications were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2456)|
| 0:41:00| I was sadly mistaken or grossly misunderstood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2460)|
| 0:41:04| I was not aware that I was going to be fined, nor would I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2464)|
| 0:41:08| to implement something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| So when I got the letter that was hand-delivered on the 2nd of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2470)|
| 0:41:14| December saying that this was my second offense and that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2474)|
| 0:41:18| needed to write it to you guys at check for $500 and send you a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2478)|
| 0:41:22| letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| I sent the check that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2484)|
| 0:41:26| And wrote this letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| And that is why nothing else has been done because I wasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2488)|
| 0:41:32| aware that I needed to put a new plan in action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2492)|
| 0:41:36| Because otherwise, I would have already done something because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2496)|
| 0:41:40| I really hate to stand here feeling like two cents waiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2500)|
| 0:41:44| on change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| Councilman Raleigh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| Ms. Mapstan, I'm looking at the letter that was sent to you that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2510)|
| 0:41:54| you received on, excuse me, on the 2nd of December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2514)|
| 0:41:58| And it does indicate in the third paragraph here that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2518)|
| 0:42:02| permit holder is required by ordinance to file with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2522)|
| 0:42:06| a revised remedial plan to provide for a new plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2526)|
| 0:42:10| And I'm looking at the letter that was sent to you that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2530)|
| 0:42:14| received on, excuse me, on the 2nd of December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2534)|
| 0:42:18| A revised remedial plan designed to prevent future violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2538)|
| 0:42:22| And we have in front of us both your letter of December 2nd of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2542)|
| 0:42:26| this year and your letter of April 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2546)|
| 0:42:30| And after the first violation, you are to submit a plan as to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2550)|
| 0:42:34| how you're going to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| And then as this letter said, in November of this year, after the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2556)|
| 0:42:40| second violation, you are to submit a letter indicating your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| revised plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2564)|
| 0:42:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| And I understand how much you care for your pub and your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2569)|
| 0:42:53| patrons that visit you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2573)|
| 0:42:57| But this afternoon, in reviewing these documents, I couldn't find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2577)|
| 0:43:01| anything that changed in your policy between your plan A and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2581)|
| 0:43:05| your plan B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| And we have store owners, business owners, restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2587)|
| 0:43:11| owners who come in front of us who are not utilizing technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2591)|
| 0:43:15| but they have come up with policies for their employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2595)|
| 0:43:19| which tighten up the ship a little bit in some respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2599)|
| 0:43:23| Maybe it's a buddy check system where more than one person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2603)|
| 0:43:27| checks an ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| Maybe it's the use of flashlights, you know, in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| darker restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2611)|
| 0:43:33| Maybe it's a monthly employee meeting where everyone's pulled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2613)|
| 0:43:37| together and the rules are reviewed one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2617)|
| 0:43:41| Maybe the owner voluntarily goes through the task certification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2621)|
| 0:43:44| again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| There's some elevation of effort noted after the second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2626)|
| 0:43:50| violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2630)|
| 0:43:52| And my concern here is that I don't see in your second letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2632)|
| 0:43:56| your second remedial plan, or in your remarks tonight, anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2636)|
| 0:44:00| that has changed in your ongoing plan that you've had since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2640)|
| 0:44:04| 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| Well, what I didn't realize is that I should have said that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2646)|
| 0:44:10| do have meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| And the guys, they will double check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| I did not realize that that is something that I should have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2654)|
| 0:44:18| stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2658)|
| 0:44:20| And I will have to admit, when I read this letter, I was kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| like in outer space and I did miss the remedial line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2662)|
| 0:44:28| Well, obviously that remedial plan is very important to us in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2668)|
| 0:44:32| ascertaining our sense of comfort level with the safety of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2672)|
| 0:44:36| patrons in any establishment and particularly underage patrons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2676)|
| 0:44:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2680)|
| 0:44:42| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2682)|
| 0:44:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2684)|
| 0:44:46| Ms. Mapstone, let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2686)|
| 0:44:48| If you were given some, I heard clearly about you misunderstood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2688)|
| 0:44:52| or just something didn't connect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2692)|
| 0:44:54| If you were given additional time to come up with a remedial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2694)|
| 0:44:56| plan, do you think you could do so?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2696)|
| 0:44:58| Yes, I do, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2700)|
| 0:45:02| Well, based on that, I'll ask to defer this to the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| regularly scheduled beer board meeting where there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| administrative hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2706)|
| 0:45:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| Councilman Boehler, you have something to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| You know, I'm just over here listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| And sometimes we get a very professional presentation and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2716)|
| 0:45:20| sometimes we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| And, you know, sometimes you hear some emotion and the tone of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| the voice of the owner and you get a sense of where they are on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2724)|
| 0:45:28| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| And, you know, Officer Huskey, we talked about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| preventative measures list, which I know you provided us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| which I think is very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2736)|
| 0:45:38| When do the owners or potential owners receive that preventative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2738)|
| 0:45:42| measures list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2742)|
| 0:45:44| And because what I'm talking about is Councilman Roddy just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2744)|
| 0:45:48| talked about the buddy check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| You know, I wonder about the lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2750)|
| 0:45:52| We've heard certain owners come in and talk about the lighting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2752)|
| 0:45:56| was bad and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| But there are a lot of inexpensive things, proactive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2758)|
| 0:46:00| things that you can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2760)|
| 0:46:02| And I just wanted to know, when do we provide that list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2762)|
| 0:46:04| Not that I know of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| I was going to say, I don't have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2766)|
| 0:46:08| Unless the Metropolitan Drug Commission, she might have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2768)|
| 0:46:10| something to say on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2770)|
| 0:46:12| I'm just wondering if at the task force, you know, the task| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2772)|
| 0:46:16| certification meetings or, you know, at some point in time, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2776)|
| 0:46:22| think some of these owners, if they had the foresight, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2782)|
| 0:46:28| would, you know, come and present us with a better plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2788)|
| 0:46:32| And they are taught in the alcohol class to flashlight, to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2792)|
| 0:46:36| take the ID, physically hold it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| But as far as us presenting them the list I gave you, that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2798)|
| 0:46:42| something that we worked with, Metropolitan Drug Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2802)|
| 0:46:44| just come up with for you all to give them bits and pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2804)|
| 0:46:48| But they do learn that in the alcohol class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| Well, I seconded Councilman Frost's motion, so that's where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| Councilman Prelow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2816)|
| 0:46:58| I hate to take a hard line on this, but very honestly, I feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2818)|
| 0:47:08| after that first letter in 2008, I would have been asking a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2828)|
| 0:47:12| of questions if I had been in your shoes and had been as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2832)|
| 0:47:16| concerned about my business as I know you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2836)|
| 0:47:20| And it's, you know, sometimes I think it's, we have to learn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2840)|
| 0:47:26| hard lessons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2846)|
| 0:47:27| And very frankly, I don't feel comfortable with a postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2847)|
| 0:47:31| of this for a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2851)|
| 0:47:33| Because frankly, I just see, I don't see someone who really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2853)|
| 0:47:39| understands the seriousness of what you were faced with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2859)|
| 0:47:43| And I, this is, in eight years, this is the first time that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2863)|
| 0:47:49| have ever seen someone who appeared just not to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2869)|
| 0:47:53| particularly concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2873)|
| 0:47:55| I'm terribly sorry, but I'm about to fall apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2875)|
| 0:47:57| My heart is about to jump out of my chest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2877)|
| 0:47:59| Well, I'm sure it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| And you're in a very difficult position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2881)|
| 0:48:03| But we are, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2883)|
| 0:48:04| And I want to be sure that everyone who comes into your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| establishment is safe, is treated in the same manner that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2886)|
| 0:48:10| they would be in another establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2890)|
| 0:48:12| So I simply, I'm not going to go along with the motion to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2892)|
| 0:48:16| defer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2896)|
| 0:48:17| But I would like to say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| When the first offense occurred last year, I went back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2899)|
| 0:48:24| work 120 hours a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2904)|
| 0:48:26| So I did not have to worry about someone else screwing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2906)|
| 0:48:30| Because I care about that pub more than anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2910)|
| 0:48:34| I realize you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2914)|
| 0:48:35| That's my family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2915)|
| 0:48:36| I care about that pub more than anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2916)|
| 0:48:38| And I'm sorry that you feel that I've been negligent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2918)|
| 0:48:40| No, I think this is going to be a very important defining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2920)|
| 0:48:44| moment in the life of your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2924)|
| 0:48:46| And unfortunately, we're put in a position of having to perhaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2926)|
| 0:48:52| make a decision that is going to require you to do some work in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2932)|
| 0:48:57| another direction where you have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| And I'm..| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2939)|
| 0:49:00| Council Member Roddick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2940)|
| 0:49:06| One of the things that the Spear Board has talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2946)|
| 0:49:10| extensively on numerous occasions is trying to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2950)|
| 0:49:13| consistent with various businesses that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2953)|
| 0:49:16| addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2956)|
| 0:49:17| And as we all know, there's always some kind of extenuating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2957)|
| 0:49:20| circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2960)|
| 0:49:21| It is a subjective decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2961)|
| 0:49:23| But we have tried very hard to be consistent in our decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2963)|
| 0:49:27| And I guess from where I sit, I feel like it is not consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2967)|
| 0:49:32| or fair to some of the other businesses that we have heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2972)|
| 0:49:36| not tonight but on other nights, who have presented remedial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2976)|
| 0:49:40| plans that we have felt were deficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2980)|
| 0:49:43| And they were not allowed a chance to go back for a do-over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2983)|
| 0:49:48| The letters that are sent out from over Chairman Hall's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2988)|
| 0:49:53| signature are very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2993)|
| 0:49:55| There's two letters after the first offense and after the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2995)|
| 0:49:58| second offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2998)|
| 0:49:59| And I don't recall us ever giving an establishment a chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=2999)|
| 0:50:04| for a do-over on their remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3004)|
| 0:50:07| Certainly that chance occurs at the suspension revocation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3007)|
| 0:50:11| hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3011)|
| 0:50:12| But I do think it's incumbent upon us to be consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3012)|
| 0:50:16| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3016)|
| 0:50:17| I actually agree with everything that you just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3017)|
| 0:50:20| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3020)|
| 0:50:21| Officer Husky, when somebody is required to prepare a remedial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3021)|
| 0:50:27| plan, can they come to you and ask for suggestions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3027)|
| 0:50:30| They certainly could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3030)|
| 0:50:31| Have they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3031)|
| 0:50:32| I mean, you said a lot of the ideas that could have gone into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3032)|
| 0:50:35| this one were taught in the task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3035)|
| 0:50:38| Occasionally I'll get a call when they're preparing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3038)|
| 0:50:40| remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3040)|
| 0:50:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3041)|
| 0:50:42| And then do you give advice about whether they're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3044)|
| 0:50:45| And then do you give advice about whether that remedial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3045)|
| 0:50:47| plan would be accepted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3047)|
| 0:50:50| Well, they talk like flashlights and we bring up ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3050)|
| 0:50:55| And sometimes they don't think of what they do to put in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3055)|
| 0:50:58| plan to let you know that they're already doing those type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3058)|
| 0:51:01| things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3061)|
| 0:51:02| But I get very few calls on it, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3062)|
| 0:51:04| But you'd be open to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3066)|
| 0:51:07| It never occurred to me the city of Knoxville would assist me in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3067)|
| 0:51:10| this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3070)|
| 0:51:11| I'm terribly sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3071)|
| 0:51:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3074)|
| 0:51:15| Are we ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3075)|
| 0:51:18| Can you restate the motion, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3078)|
| 0:51:20| The motion is to defer them to the next regularly scheduled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3080)|
| 0:51:24| beer board meeting that has administrative hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3084)|
| 0:51:30| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3090)|
| 0:51:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3093)|
| 0:51:34| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3094)|
| 0:51:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3095)|
| 0:51:36| We'll call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3096)|
| 0:51:38| Councilman Booker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3098)|
| 0:51:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3099)|
| 0:51:40| Councilman Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3100)|
| 0:51:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3101)|
| 0:51:42| Councilman Hall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3102)|
| 0:51:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3103)|
| 0:51:44| Councilman Holtquist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3104)|
| 0:51:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3105)|
| 0:51:46| Councilman Pelo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3106)|
| 0:51:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3107)|
| 0:51:48| Councilman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3108)|
| 0:51:49| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3109)|
| 0:51:50| Councilman Woodhull?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3110)|
| 0:51:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3111)|
| 0:51:52| Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3112)|
| 0:51:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3113)|
| 0:51:54| Vice Mayor Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3114)|
| 0:51:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3115)|
| 0:51:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3116)|

| 0:51:58| So it's tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3118)|
| 0:51:59| Now what do we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3119)|
| 0:52:00| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3120)|
| 0:52:01| You guys, I think I need to sit down or I'm going to pass out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3121)|

| 0:52:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3147)|
| 0:52:32| Councilman Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3152)|
| 0:52:33| I'll make a motion to send with suspension revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3153)|
| 0:52:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3156)|
| 0:52:37| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3159)|
| 0:52:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3163)|
| 0:52:44| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3164)|
| 0:52:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3165)|
| 0:52:46| I'll lower it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| Councilman Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3168)|
| 0:52:51| Councilman Hall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3171)|
| 0:52:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3172)|
| 0:52:53| Heldquist. Councilman P. Lowe. Aye. Councilman Roddy. Aye. Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3173)|
| 0:53:01| Woodhull. Aye. Councilman Bailey. No. Vice Mayor Becker. Aye. Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3181)|
| 0:53:08| Booker. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3188)|
| 0:53:16| Ma'am, they'll be notifying you of where to appear for a suspension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3196)|
| 0:53:21| revocation hearing. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3201)|
| 0:53:28| Councilman Roddy. I'm terribly sorry. What did you just say to me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3208)|
| 0:53:32| They will be. They will be notifying you of a suspension revocation hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3212)|
| 0:53:38| for you to come to to attend. Chairman Hall, could you address what happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3218)|
| 0:53:45| at those hearings? Typically, the suspension revocation is not permanent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3225)|
| 0:53:49| Is that right? Right. And it's not. And there's really it's up to an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3229)|
| 0:53:53| administrative judge, I guess what they call them, to to make the decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3233)|
| 0:53:59| to to hear. It'll be another something like this, except more formal, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3239)|
| 0:54:06| guess. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3246)|
| 0:54:07| All right. I work, apparently, I need to work on a real remedial plan and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3247)|
| 0:54:22| have a form of technology in place. And what else? Because... You'll be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3262)|
| 0:54:35| contacted from the law department, from the from the city council, from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3275)|
| 0:54:43| the beer board office, and which is a city council office, with the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3283)|
| 0:54:49| Okay. When is your next meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3289)|
| 0:54:59| When's your next meeting? Oh, it's not the next meeting. They'll notify you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3299)|
| 0:55:02| as to when to come and where. It won't be here in this in this room. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3302)|
| 0:55:11| Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Councilman Bailey, do you have something? No, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3311)|
| 0:55:17| don't. No. Okay. Councilman Moratti? I do. This is an item of new business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3317)|
| 0:55:24| Chairman Hall, but relative to to our last permittee, I'm wondering if would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3324)|
| 0:55:29| it... Would this beer board feel it would be appropriate to ask Officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3329)|
| 0:55:34| Husky and his compliance department or or maybe Mitchell and the recorder's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3334)|
| 0:55:39| office to send out that list of suggestions with the letter following| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3339)|
| 0:55:45| the noncompliance, either the... I guess at the first, to give businesses ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3345)|
| 0:55:50| where to start in terms of putting together their plan. Would that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3350)|
| 0:55:53| that be considered helpful? Yes, that'd be fine. Thank you. Sounds like a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3353)|
| 0:55:56| idea to me. Councilman? Well, maybe in addition to that, it would be important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3356)|
| 0:56:01| to just indicate to the individuals or the business that your assistance is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3361)|
| 0:56:10| available if they would like to request it and then allow them to make that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3370)|
| 0:56:15| decision. And I don't want to request anything that's going to be onerous or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3375)|
| 0:56:18| burdensome on anybody's office, but I thought at least the list of suggestions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3378)|
| 0:56:21| might be placed for them. Officer Husky? We, after the first sale, we hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3381)|
| 0:56:25| deliver personally a notice and that wouldn't be an issue to put that along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3385)|
| 0:56:30| with it. That's good. Councilman Becker? Yeah, I guess I think it's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3390)|
| 0:56:36| I sort of worry, and I guess this is for Mr. Swanson or Mr. Frost, about a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3396)|
| 0:56:42| liability. If we have given somebody a list of suggestions and then turn around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3402)|
| 0:56:47| and they do some of those suggestions and we still find them, but I mean is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3407)|
| 0:56:51| that, and I don't want to, you know, ask the lawyers too much here because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3411)|
| 0:56:57| know lawyers can say no to anything, but just I'd sort of like some thought on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3417)|
| 0:57:03| how to do that the right way. Bob, it just wasn't a lawyer saying no to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3423)|
| 0:57:07| tonight. It was eight people that have said no to you tonight. I really don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3427)|
| 0:57:14| think that's a problem. If you just present them with some list of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3434)|
| 0:57:17| suggestions of things that can be done to make their business practices better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3437)|
| 0:57:22| business practices, that does not in any way imply that City Council is going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3442)|
| 0:57:28| accept that all by itself as being sufficient to avoid going to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3448)|
| 0:57:32| suspension or revocation hearing. It's just simply an opportunity for them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3452)|
| 0:57:35| have additional information. It's a source of information for them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3455)|
| 0:57:40| utilize in doing a remedial plan, but there's certainly no guarantee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3460)|
| 0:57:44| associated with it that it would be adequate to address every concern that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3464)|
| 0:57:50| you might have. So as long as it doesn't contain such a representation, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3470)|
| 0:57:54| think you'd be all right. All right, that sounds good. Thank you. Is there any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3474)|
| 0:57:59| business needs to come before the beer board? We stand adjourned. Wait a minute, Chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3479)|
| 0:58:05| Hall. That's my light. Oh, okay. Excuse me. I was just going to thank you for your role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3485)|
| 0:58:09| as chairman of the beer board. You've done a great job. You've been steady and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3489)|
| 0:58:13| a pillar in a very important position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3493)|
| 0:58:16| And I would like to thank Officer Husky because he has certainly been very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3496)|
| 0:58:31| beneficial to all of us. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd091215?start=3511)|
