| 0:02:03| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=123)|
| 0:02:06| At this time, I'd like to call on Commissioner Hill to lead us in this evening's devotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=126)|
| 0:02:25| Thank you, Commissioner Baylor. Thank you, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=145)|
| 0:02:33| I want to ask you all the question about what really matters to you in life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=153)|
| 0:02:38| What's important? What matters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=158)|
| 0:02:41| I can pretty well guess that many of us will have the same answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=161)|
| 0:02:47| Probably our faith, probably our family, our friends, things like financial security, things like the environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=167)|
| 0:03:01| I don't know what your particular list might look like, but I want to challenge you when I finish this short devotion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=181)|
| 0:03:09| that you might automatically have another word that will come to mind in addition to the usual set that we typically hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=189)|
| 0:03:19| I'm taking a part of my devotion out of a book that I have read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=199)|
| 0:03:24| I'm a real history buff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=204)|
| 0:03:26| I know a lot of you all like to read history, especially U.S. history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=206)|
| 0:03:30| The name of this book is called The Third Greatest Fighter Pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=210)|
| 0:03:36| It's actually written by a World War II veteran that was, of course, a pilot too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=216)|
| 0:03:43| One of the first stories he writes about was being a very young boy in North Carolina, not raised with a whole lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=223)|
| 0:03:52| except a family that loved him very much, but money was tight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=232)|
| 0:03:58| One of the first jobs he ever had was riding a bicycle and delivering newspapers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=238)|
| 0:04:05| Some of you all may remember when newspapers were delivered by the bicycle with some usually young boy that would ride,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=245)|
| 0:04:15| get up at the crack of dawn and throw the newspapers kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=255)|
| 0:04:21| This gentleman's name is Bill, and this became his bread and butter for quite a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=261)|
| 0:04:28| The only thing he really worried about in life at that point was his bicycle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=268)|
| 0:04:34| because once or twice he'd gotten a flat tire, and a flat tire not only meant trying to find some money to fix it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=274)|
| 0:04:42| but also the inability to deliver his newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=282)|
| 0:04:48| Then when he couldn't deliver his newspaper, the people would get mad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=288)|
| 0:04:52| and then when the people got mad, they would no longer pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=292)|
| 0:04:56| So this bicycle in this young boy's life turned out to be, in his world, what really mattered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=296)|
| 0:05:04| Life moves on, and World War II breaks out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=304)|
| 0:05:11| Faithful, because one of the many things that he was very passionate about was his family and his country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=311)|
| 0:05:25| Now, right before that, I will tell you, though, that this young boy was in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=325)|
| 0:05:30| School was not particularly fun for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=330)|
| 0:05:35| He recalls always feeling bored and being satisfied with a C,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=335)|
| 0:05:43| because after all, he writes something like, you know, in the end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=343)|
| 0:05:48| and they never really got me any further, I still would get the credit for my class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=348)|
| 0:05:53| You know, if any of you have thought that yourself, or perhaps had children that felt that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=353)|
| 0:06:00| it's kind of an ongoing problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=360)|
| 0:06:04| But he does go on to write that the one thing that school did teach him was a sense of discipline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=364)|
| 0:06:11| and a sense of doing the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=371)|
| 0:06:16| You know, he was raised in the old school where you didn't disagree with mom and dad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=376)|
| 0:06:22| and you didn't disagree with the teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=382)|
| 0:06:25| The teacher was right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=385)|
| 0:06:27| And so through all this, he came to also place a value on education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=387)|
| 0:06:33| In fact, education began to matter for him very much as he got closer to graduation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=393)|
| 0:06:40| recognizing that if he were ever going to have the ability to move out of this town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=400)|
| 0:06:47| that he probably needed to get an education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=407)|
| 0:06:50| Right after that, then, World War II breaks out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=410)|
| 0:06:53| and so he does what most men of his generation did and joined the war, World War II.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=413)|
| 0:07:01| He went to training school and flew a P-51| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=421)|
| 0:07:09| and thought that this was the absolute best thing that could have ever happened to him in his life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=429)|
| 0:07:16| and felt proud to be able to represent us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=436)|
| 0:07:21| And he wasn't in the air probably more than about 30 missions, and he's shot down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=441)|
| 0:07:28| He's flying over Burma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=448)|
| 0:07:30| So he goes down in Burma, and as it turns out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=450)|
| 0:07:33| he was able to make a landing on some real tall elephant grass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=453)|
| 0:07:39| but still tore up his plane, and he still had fear of the enemy being nearby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=459)|
| 0:07:44| So he writes again at that point in life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=464)|
| 0:07:48| what really mattered to him was his canteen of water, his flare gun, mosquito repellent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=468)|
| 0:07:58| and water purification tablets in addition to his weapon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=478)|
| 0:08:03| Now, to say that these things were not even on his radar 10 years earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=483)|
| 0:08:08| when he was riding a bike and what mattered to him goes without saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=488)|
| 0:08:14| but it shows the shift in things that were important and ultimately what they all led to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=494)|
| 0:08:22| This same young man decides to make the Air Force a career| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=502)|
| 0:08:27| and ends up earning the rank of colonel and is sent to Vietnam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=507)|
| 0:08:36| In Vietnam, he commanded his own squadron,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=516)|
| 0:08:39| and he not only commanded the squadron, he flew with the squadron.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=519)|
| 0:08:43| He ended up with 383 missions in the air while he served in Vietnam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=523)|
| 0:08:49| One of the incidences that he talks about, and I'll just very briefly read this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=529)|
| 0:08:57| is he says, we've been airborne only a few minutes when I received a call from flight control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=537)|
| 0:09:04| that we were being diverted to troops in contact near Dunlap, which was near Phan Rang.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=544)|
| 0:09:11| This troops in contact meant that some of our boys were in trouble on the ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=551)|
| 0:09:18| and the mission that his squadron was initially assigned to had been diverted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=558)|
| 0:09:27| They were briefed that they had a search and destroy patrol with a code name Tiger Bandit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=567)|
| 0:09:36| that was surrounding the battalion, and it was pretty clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=576)|
| 0:09:40| that if they didn't get some air-to-ground coverage that this battalion was going to be lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=580)|
| 0:09:48| Bill writes that he flew directly to the area with his wingman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=588)|
| 0:09:55| and when he got there, they discovered that weather was going to be a very serious problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=595)|
| 0:10:00| Weather, which had previously been absolutely beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=600)|
| 0:10:05| So there was a low cloud layer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=605)|
| 0:10:08| They looked over the target area, and he writes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=608)|
| 0:10:13| we were just afraid we could not get beneath the layer and have enough space to make the passes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=613)|
| 0:10:20| so that they could clear the ground and shoot, at the same time not shoot our own troops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=620)|
| 0:10:25| but shoot the enemy troops and not let the cloud cover that was directly above them be an impediment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=625)|
| 0:10:37| So he writes, we were looking at nearly impossible attack conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=637)|
| 0:10:42| yet the accuracy requirements were much greater than normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=642)|
| 0:10:46| We couldn't afford to miss or have a short round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=646)|
| 0:10:49| A miss would have helped no one, and a short round could have killed our own troops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=649)|
| 0:10:55| He came out of that experience a very reflective man and began thinking about his life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=655)|
| 0:11:04| and that was ultimately what led to him writing this autobiography| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=664)|
| 0:11:09| and reflects back on how every instance that I highlighted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=669)|
| 0:11:14| in the end, although on the surface it seemed like a bicycle mattered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=674)|
| 0:11:20| or a canteen of water mattered or the weather mattered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=680)|
| 0:11:25| ultimately what all these led to and what really mattered to him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=685)|
| 0:11:32| and I believe it's a value that we all carry, is our freedom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=692)|
| 0:11:38| Because all of this ultimately was about our freedom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=698)|
| 0:11:43| If you would bow for just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=703)|
| 0:11:47| We thank you, Lord, for the privilege of being able to serve, coming here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=707)|
| 0:11:53| the privilege of being able to be heard, whether for or against an issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=713)|
| 0:11:58| that we can do this and we do not have to fear a retribution or, worse yet, our own lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=718)|
| 0:12:07| Lord, help us remember the men and women that allowed us to get to that point in our lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=727)|
| 0:12:15| and help us to be forever grateful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=735)|

| 0:29:45| It is with great honor that I recognize one of the finest citizens that we have here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=1785)|
| 0:29:55| Just a little bit of background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=1795)|
| 0:30:02| Russ, I've shared with you that I knew your father.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=1802)|
| 0:30:05| That when I was much, much younger and very new to Knox County schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=1805)|
| 0:30:13| one of the first schools that I was assigned to was an elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=1813)|
| 0:30:20| And at that point, many, many years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=1820)|
| 0:30:25| it was unusual to have men in the elementary grades that served in leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=1825)|
| 0:30:30| This had traditionally been a woman's role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=1830)|
| 0:30:35| And I walk in and here's this good-looking fellow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=1835)|
| 0:30:39| He comes up to me and says, well, you must be our new social worker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=1839)|
| 0:30:43| And he shakes my hand and was just the most inviting, engaging man probably that I'd run across again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=1843)|
| 0:30:52| I was so new and so green in so many ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=1852)|
| 0:30:55| But I will tell you the years that I worked with this man, and we had difficult, difficult situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=1855)|
| 0:31:02| We dealt with some domestic violence and some abusive situations that were hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=1862)|
| 0:31:11| And one of the things, Russ, that your father taught me was to be still and listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=1871)|
| 0:31:23| And I will tell you that that was a wonderful thing to internalize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=1883)|
| 0:31:31| and I notice it very much in his son, another Dr. Russ Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=1891)|
| 0:31:42| One of the things that the old Dr. Frazier did was remain quiet a lot of times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=1902)|
| 0:31:49| and kind of stay in the background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=1909)|
| 0:31:52| And this, again, is one of the attributes of his son,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=1912)|
| 0:31:58| who the multi-talented person that he is and the many, many talents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=1918)|
| 0:32:04| and hours and hours of community service that he has given,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=1924)|
| 0:32:08| yet he remains quiet and steady and in the background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=1928)|
| 0:32:14| So I was very impressed, especially after his trip to Ukraine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=1934)|
| 0:32:18| that he'd get out of the background and be recognized for the man that he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=1938)|
| 0:32:24| So I'm going to read this, and it just summarizes a little bit of who you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=1944)|

| 0:42:08| This is line item transfers, total amount of $277,402.57.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2528)|
| 0:42:18| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2538)|
| 0:42:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2540)|
| 0:42:21| I have a motion by Commissioner Schoonmaker to approve line item transfers, second by Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2541)|
| 0:42:26| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2546)|
| 0:42:34| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2554)|
| 0:42:45| I just want to make sure that the line item transfers, yeah, this is where it hit from last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2565)|
| 0:42:51| Do you want to take it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2571)|
| 0:42:52| I'm going to defer to Commissioner Schoonmaker, but I'll come back around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2572)|
| 0:42:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2579)|
| 0:43:03| Last week it was brought to our attention the over-the-budget resolution that you brought forth as a line item transfer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2583)|
| 0:43:14| for the amount of $59,160.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2594)|
| 0:43:18| And in the past, in budget year 19, the cost to the taxpayers in Knox County was $5,200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2598)|
| 0:43:30| The cost in year 20 was $2,600 for the judicial magistrates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2610)|
| 0:43:37| In 21, it catapulted to $86,780.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2617)|
| 0:43:43| And then, I'm not even sure if this is a current year-to-date of $60,060.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2623)|
| 0:43:50| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2630)|
| 0:43:52| Those numbers, I think, are the numbers that I sent out after the workshop on Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2632)|
| 0:43:58| and those numbers seem correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| I would say that the number that you called off for fiscal year 22,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2640)|
| 0:44:05| there's still probably two to three weeks of June to put in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2645)|
| 0:44:09| so you will likely see another line item transfer coming to you next month as we close out the books for FY22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2649)|
| 0:44:18| Were you surprised in the acceleration of this overage in the county budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2658)|
| 0:44:26| I think ultimately, when you look at it and you look at that five-year trend, there has been an acceleration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2666)|
| 0:44:34| And so, what we have done this year in FY23, there was a request for a budget for substitute magistrates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2674)|
| 0:44:45| An increase there, we did budget some funds for FY23 for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2685)|
| 0:44:52| Ultimately, you try to look for trends, and I think there's a few things that come from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2692)|
| 0:45:06| As you all know, and Commissioner Schoonmaker, you're well aware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2706)|
| 0:45:10| we cannot end the fiscal year with a negative major categorical item, so we have to fix this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2710)|
| 0:45:18| But I think what you can do from this is learn from it and maybe even do some evaluation and see what can be helped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2718)|
| 0:45:32| And then next, I'd like to ask a couple questions to the Chief Magistrate, Chris Rowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2732)|
| 0:45:42| Commissioner, if I may for a moment, this is not directed at you at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| I just want to remind all of my colleagues that we are in a public meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2745)|
| 0:45:50| so please keep any questions to the issue of finance. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2750)|
| 0:45:57| Yes, I'm Chris Rowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2757)|
| 0:45:58| Thank you. We received, all of us received your packet today that you had put together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2758)|
| 0:46:03| and do you have a copy of that packet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2763)|
| 0:46:06| I have my copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2766)|
| 0:46:08| On your annual leave total there, page 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2768)|
| 0:46:13| Page 2, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2773)|
| 0:46:15| I notice that for years 21 and 22, four of the five judicial magistrates do not take comp time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2775)|
| 0:46:30| One magistrate took 150, is that days, in 2021?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2790)|
| 0:46:37| Hours. These are all hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| Hours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2799)|
| 0:46:40| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2800)|
| 0:46:41| Okay, so for the 72 hours in 22, that would be multiplied by the hourly rate of $40 for hiring the outside person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2801)|
| 0:46:51| In 22, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2813)|
| 0:46:54| The hours, as of 22, the pay rate changed, I believe, in July of 2020, is I believe when that change occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2814)|
| 0:47:07| So in 22, the hours that would be filled by substitutes would have been billed at a $40 an hour rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2827)|
| 0:47:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2834)|
| 0:47:15| Do the other four magistrates just not take comp time, or they just don't record that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2835)|
| 0:47:24| Not all of the magistrates have taken comp time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2844)|
| 0:47:27| Some do if they work a holiday, like a July 4th or something that they're on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2847)|
| 0:47:33| Some will, and then some will take comp time if they have covered other shifts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2853)|
| 0:47:39| I know that Magistrate Jenkins, in particular, during the time when two of the magistrates were out for a number of months with significant health issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2859)|
| 0:47:49| did help cover some of those shifts, and so then did elect to take comp time for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2869)|
| 0:47:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2879)|
| 0:48:00| And then just procedurally, if somebody is going to miss a day of work, do they notify you and you assign the substitute magistrate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2880)|
| 0:48:09| No, they contact the substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| They directly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2891)|
| 0:48:12| Because we have, the number fluctuates because sometimes we'll have two or three available and sometimes we've had less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2892)|
| 0:48:19| and that's, we had gotten very low on our substitutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2899)|
| 0:48:22| That's why we requested a pay raise a number of years ago because we were having a hard time getting attorneys willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2902)|
| 0:48:29| So they contact the attorney and schedule that themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2909)|
| 0:48:32| Then they turn in a sheet at the end of the month reflecting the time they took and whether it was vacation or sick time or bereavement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2912)|
| 0:48:42| But they can determine who replaces them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2922)|
| 0:48:45| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2925)|
| 0:48:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2926)|
| 0:48:47| So it's not up to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2927)|
| 0:48:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2928)|
| 0:48:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2929)|
| 0:48:50| We have a field of attorneys, we have two or three attorneys that they can contact that have been trained to fill in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2930)|
| 0:48:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2935)|
| 0:48:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2936)|
| 0:48:57| And then we did also get a letter from Judge Stansberry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2937)|
| 0:49:00| Is there something that he would like to add to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2940)|
| 0:49:03| I see him in the audience here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2943)|
| 0:49:06| I'll make myself available to you all for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2946)|
| 0:49:10| A couple of things about the eye-popping numbers that you're making reference to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2950)|
| 0:49:17| I can remember when we could not, and I'm a little hoarse, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2957)|
| 0:49:21| Can you just get a little closer to the mic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2961)|
| 0:49:23| Your Honor, if you would, for the clerk, just state your name and your position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2963)|
| 0:49:27| Tony Stansberry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2967)|
| 0:49:28| I'm a general sessions court judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| I live at 1609 Botsford Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2970)|
| 0:49:34| Commissioner Ward is my commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2974)|
| 0:49:37| The only thing I wanted to say about the eye-popping numbers that we're talking about today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2977)|
| 0:49:42| I can remember before any of these magistrates were on duty, we could not get a qualified substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2982)|
| 0:49:50| And we had a conspiracy case, a fairly large drug case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2990)|
| 0:49:55| and our substitute didn't know much about criminal law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2995)|
| 0:49:59| and he assigned like eight or ten cases, individuals, to the public defender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=2999)|
| 0:50:06| Well, the public defender can't represent but one person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3006)|
| 0:50:10| So we have worked for years to try to get the amount up as far as a shift goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3010)|
| 0:50:17| The magistrates work a 12-hour shift, and they're on a rotating schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3017)|
| 0:50:22| You've got their schedules in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3022)|
| 0:50:24| So in July of 2020, Judge Emery has been the one that has traditionally overseen the budgetary process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3024)|
| 0:50:33| and he retired at the end of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3033)|
| 0:50:36| But the amount was approved by you all, and we appreciate that, to go from $200 a shift to $440 a shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3036)|
| 0:50:44| And that was in large part because we could not find competent magistrates for substitutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3044)|
| 0:50:53| It created a lot of problems in court for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3053)|
| 0:50:58| And like Magistrate Rose made reference to, two of our magistrates just had catastrophic circumstances that presented themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3058)|
| 0:51:09| So it was sort of a perfect storm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3069)|
| 0:51:11| And we never know how much we're going to need in that budget, so we request a low figure for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3071)|
| 0:51:23| because we never know how much is going to be needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3083)|
| 0:51:26| And like the end of last year started this year, we had a great need for two of our magistrates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3086)|
| 0:51:33| And I'll be happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3093)|
| 0:51:40| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3100)|
| 0:51:41| Commissioner Jay, did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3101)|
| 0:51:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3104)|
| 0:51:45| I want to thank you, Judge Stansbury and Chief Rowe, for the information that you presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3105)|
| 0:51:52| It was very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3112)|
| 0:51:53| It was very comprehensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3113)|
| 0:51:55| I think these are things we don't normally get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3115)|
| 0:51:59| And I think when we sort of dug into it last week, we certainly didn't understand the extenuating circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3119)|
| 0:52:06| and the perfect storm of personal, professional, global pandemic, and everything in between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3126)|
| 0:52:13| I'm glad we raised the rate to give the resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3133)|
| 0:52:16| But I think this kind of became a situation where our team in Knox County that is budgetary and HR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3136)|
| 0:52:26| doesn't track this information, and it's tracked separately with the court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3146)|
| 0:52:30| and the left hand and the right hand didn't necessarily talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3150)|
| 0:52:33| Obviously, in retrospect, we all would have done a little bit differently and gotten ahead of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3153)|
| 0:52:38| We've talked to the finance director about what can we do going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3158)|
| 0:52:42| to make sure you have the resources that you need to conduct the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3162)|
| 0:52:46| I would hope that everybody would want to make sure you have all the resources that are necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3166)|
| 0:52:52| but we also want to make sure we don't wake up because it could be other departments that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3172)|
| 0:52:57| if we don't know what's coming, and then we have to adjust the budget over and again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3177)|
| 0:53:00| So, Mr. Chairman, I seconded the motion to approve the line item transfer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3180)|
| 0:53:07| but I'd also, I don't know if it's a substitute motion or if I just, you know, whatever the case might be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3187)|
| 0:53:12| but I'd like to also tag onto that to send all this information essentially to the audit committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3192)|
| 0:53:18| and the audit team just for review and recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| I mean, we sort of have this great tool to be able to kind of look at stuff and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3201)|
| 0:53:25| is there a way we can avoid it in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3205)|
| 0:53:27| Is there anything else we ought to pay attention to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3207)|
| 0:53:30| So would you consider that a substitute motion or something totally different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3210)|
| 0:53:36| I think it's a different issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3216)|
| 0:53:37| I don't think it would necessarily be appropriate in a line item transfer motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3217)|
| 0:53:41| Yeah, but what we can do is do an informal recommendation to the Knox County Internal Audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3221)|
| 0:53:47| to send this to them for investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3227)|
| 0:53:50| Okay, so I'll hold with the original motion when we're done if I could have a moment to just present that to the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3230)|
| 0:53:56| Yes, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3236)|
| 0:53:57| Thank you, Judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3237)|
| 0:53:58| Mr. Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3238)|
| 0:53:59| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3239)|
| 0:54:02| Judge Stanberry and Judge Rowe, when these figures came up, they were kind of like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3242)|
| 0:54:10| whoa, what is that going on there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3250)|
| 0:54:12| We understand what's happening, that you need that help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3252)|
| 0:54:17| Have you been working with Mr. Caldwell to make sure that we have enough in your budget that this doesn't pop out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3257)|
| 0:54:27| so it doesn't look real good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3267)|
| 0:54:33| Have you been working with the finance department to see what you need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3273)|
| 0:54:37| Not to this time, but I'm more than happy to meet with them and do whatever we need to do to make sure this doesn't happen going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3277)|
| 0:54:45| Mr. Caldwell, I'm not putting you on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| It's just that if we need to add something to the budget, let's do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3287)|
| 0:54:54| I think current year in FY23, there are budgeted funds there for substitutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3294)|
| 0:55:05| and I think we see how those track this year compared to actual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3305)|
| 0:55:09| We can look at six months and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3309)|
| 0:55:13| I think what I would say to this body is I concur with what Commissioner Jay and Commissioner Schoonmaker are saying related to the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3313)|
| 0:55:30| There's one other thing that I would add on to that, and I'm going to put on my accountant hat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3330)|
| 0:55:37| is that from an internal control standpoint, we have the ability to track annual and sick leave and payroll,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3337)|
| 0:55:44| and we do it across the board, and there's no reason we can't do it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3344)|
| 0:55:49| I assure you that our external auditors have watched this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3349)|
| 0:55:53| and I can assure you one place they're going to look is annual and sick leave for magistrates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3353)|
| 0:56:01| They're going to check it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3361)|
| 0:56:02| It's just all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3362)|
| 0:56:03| They're going to come back, and they're going to say, you have the ability to track this through a system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3363)|
| 0:56:08| Why are you tracking it internal and in-house, and you shouldn't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3368)|
| 0:56:12| And so that's something that we should do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3372)|
| 0:56:16| Second thing, we talked about comp time a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3376)|
| 0:56:19| From an HR standpoint, I don't even know if they should qualify for comp time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3379)|
| 0:56:23| Are they exempt employees or are they non-exempt employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3383)|
| 0:56:27| Those are things that we need to work through because ultimately you don't know what you don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3387)|
| 0:56:34| And then from an accrual standpoint, what amount should they be accruing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3394)|
| 0:56:40| Are they accruing from what they sent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3400)|
| 0:56:42| They're accruing what is in the handbook if you're a 40-hour employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3402)|
| 0:56:49| If they don't work for 40 hours, there should be a pro-rated amount, which our system is able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3409)|
| 0:56:58| So I think just from an accounting standpoint and from an audit standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3418)|
| 0:57:03| these are things that are going to be looked at now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3423)|
| 0:57:07| You can just count on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3427)|
| 0:57:09| And I think ultimately we could put them on payroll accrual, I won't say tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3429)|
| 0:57:17| but in the next little bit just to get that started because that's an area where there is great risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3437)|
| 0:57:23| and where there's great risk you've got to cover yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3443)|
| 0:57:28| I'm not saying anybody's doing anything wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| I'm just saying from an internal control standpoint, if you have the ability to track it in a system and you don't, that's risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3450)|
| 0:57:40| Thank you, Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3460)|
| 0:57:43| Thank you, Commissioner Bessler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3463)|
| 0:57:44| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3466)|
| 0:57:47| Judge Stansberry, I am not familiar with the way magistrates actually function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3467)|
| 0:57:53| These shifts, are they on premises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3473)|
| 0:57:58| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3478)|

| 0:59:04| and I also agree with Mr. Caldwell that this needs to be part of the payroll program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3544)|
| 0:59:10| However, we need to do that as a request to payroll that they do that to track the leave and time off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3550)|
| 0:59:21| I think ultimately, and I'm going to look to you all as a body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3561)|
| 0:59:25| I think from an oversight standpoint, you oversee the magistrate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3565)|
| 0:59:33| So I think you can direct them as a body to use that system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3573)|
| 0:59:39| and then we'll have to work through that with payroll,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3579)|
| 0:59:43| and they'll work through it with HR as well from a standpoint of are you exempt or not exempt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3583)|
| 0:59:49| and how many hours are you working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3589)|

| 1:01:09| it probably needs to be noticed as part of our agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220725-business-part-1?start=3669)|
