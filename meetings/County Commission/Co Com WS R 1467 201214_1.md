| 2:26:35| have to call that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8795)|
| 2:26:36| But the emergency meeting we're talking about is one that he can just call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8796)|
| 2:26:39| at any time for no reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8799)|
| 2:26:43| So for the clarifying, Commissioner Beeler, Section W,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8803)|
| 2:26:47| this is Section W of our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8807)|
| 2:26:50| And Section W of our rules, I just want to read it just to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8810)|
| 2:26:54| everybody's on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8814)|
| 2:26:57| Emergency meetings, the mayor or chair of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8817)|
| 2:27:00| so we have two people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8820)|
| 2:27:01| should be authorized to call a special session of the commission for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8821)|
| 2:27:04| emergency purposes when, in the opinion of the mayor or the chair of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8824)|
| 2:27:07| commission, the public necessities require it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8827)|
| 2:27:10| The call should be made by publication of a notice in a newspaper published| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8830)|
| 2:27:13| in the county and by personal notification to the members of the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8833)|
| 2:27:17| at least 48 hours before the time of convening of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8837)|
| 2:27:20| The notice shall specify objects and purposes for which such emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8840)|
| 2:27:26| special session is called and no other business that embraced it in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8846)|
| 2:27:31| notice shall be translated during a special session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8851)|
| 2:27:34| A 48-hour notice required may be waived in a declared state of emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8854)|
| 2:27:38| or in matters of great public importance where time is of the essence as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8858)|
| 2:27:41| determined by the mayor or the chair of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8861)|
| 2:27:44| Well, you know, in the interest of precedent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8864)|
| 2:27:48| I'd like to see this at least move forward to the commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8868)|
| 2:27:52| However, I don't support a measure to limit the chief executive's ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8872)|
| 2:27:59| to call the legislative body into session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8879)|
| 2:28:02| I don't think that's in the spirit of the way our constitutional republic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8882)|
| 2:28:08| works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8888)|
| 2:28:09| So I would like to offer a substitute motion that we send this forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8889)|
| 2:28:12| without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8892)|
| 2:28:15| Is there a second for the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8895)|
| 2:28:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8897)|
| 2:28:18| Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8898)|
| 2:28:19| Second from Commissioner Biggs and a first from Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8899)|
| 2:28:23| The motion is to send forward without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8903)|
| 2:28:27| So that would move it to next week without a vote this week for any kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8907)|
| 2:28:32| approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8912)|
| 2:28:33| So that would move it forward and we would decide next week upon further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8913)|
| 2:28:36| discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8916)|
| 2:28:37| I'll open up the floor for discussion on the substitute motion to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8917)|
| 2:28:41| without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8921)|
| 2:28:43| Let's start with Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8923)|
| 2:28:46| Did you want to jump in on this as a point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8926)|
| 2:28:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8929)|
| 2:28:50| I was just wondering when was the last time the mayor actually called an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8930)|
| 2:28:52| emergency session?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8932)|
| 2:28:56| I'm not aware of one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8936)|
| 2:29:00| Is anybody aware of one or the clerk's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8940)|
| 2:29:04| I'll say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8944)|
| 2:29:06| Ah, that was like two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8946)|
| 2:29:10| So it's something that very rarely happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8950)|
| 2:29:14| I think so unless somebody knows otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8954)|
| 2:29:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8961)|
| 2:29:23| Any other comments, Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8963)|
| 2:29:25| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8965)|
| 2:29:26| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8966)|
| 2:29:27| Commissioner Beeler, I'm going to jump past you because you had the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8967)|
| 2:29:32| I'm going to go to Commissioner Schoonmaker next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8972)|
| 2:29:34| Smith, Daly, Busler, and Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8974)|
| 2:29:37| So, Commissioner Schoonmaker, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8977)|
| 2:29:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8980)|
| 2:29:42| I have a question about the wording on the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8982)|
| 2:29:46| Can we discuss that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8986)|
| 2:29:48| Right now we can only discuss the, yes, because you're going to the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8988)|
| 2:29:53| will be moved forward to next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8993)|
| 2:29:55| So you can discuss the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8995)|
| 2:29:57| And are you looking at the red line copy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8997)|
| 2:29:59| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=8999)|
| 2:30:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9000)|
| 2:30:01| So, yes, you can discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9001)|
| 2:30:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9002)|
| 2:30:03| This will be the red line copy on your agenda online, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9003)|
| 2:30:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9006)|
| 2:30:07| And then also probably the law director may need to weigh in on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9007)|
| 2:30:11| But it says that the call shall be made by publication of a notice in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9011)|
| 2:30:17| newspaper published in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9017)|
| 2:30:20| If it's an emergency meeting and is backed up as the local newspaper is now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9020)|
| 2:30:27| getting things in it, an emergency meeting ends up turning into be about a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9027)|
| 2:30:32| five-day meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9032)|
| 2:30:33| So can that sentence be eliminated from this resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9033)|
| 2:30:39| Do you follow me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9039)|
| 2:30:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9043)|
| 2:30:44| I believe that's why they put the last line in there originally, which says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9044)|
| 2:30:48| the 48-hour notice requirement may be waived in a Declarative Emergency of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9048)|
| 2:30:53| the matter, which is a great public importance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9053)|
| 2:30:55| I think that's the notification of commissioners, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9055)|
| 2:31:00| Well, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9060)|
| 2:31:01| It just basically says if you're going to call an emergency meeting, you need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9061)|
| 2:31:05| to have 48 hours notice to everybody, to the commissioners, to the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9065)|
| 2:31:10| to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9070)|
| 2:31:11| But let's say there's a giant natural disaster and you've got to pull| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9071)|
| 2:31:14| everybody together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9074)|
| 2:31:15| That last line says if the mayor, you know, if either party or, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9075)|
| 2:31:21| if the parties say it's, we got to waive it because there's a big, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9081)|
| 2:31:25| the city, county building's on fire, then it gives you the authority to waive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9085)|
| 2:31:29| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9089)|
| 2:31:30| But again, I go back to emergency meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9090)|
| 2:31:32| Why do we even need that line in there about having it in the local paper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9092)|
| 2:31:38| And I didn't know if the law director wanted to weigh in if this is a state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9098)|
| 2:31:42| requirement or if it's our rules, it's our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9102)|
| 2:31:49| Mr. Book, you're on mute, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9109)|
| 2:31:52| It's your rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9112)|
| 2:31:54| There's nothing in the state law that requires that other than the Open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9114)|
| 2:31:58| Meetings Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9118)|
| 2:32:01| And in an emergency, I believe you can call this meeting and you're correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9121)|
| 2:32:07| the 48 hours is the 48 hours that's required of county commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9127)|
| 2:32:13| regardless of the notice to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9133)|
| 2:32:16| But if you're talking about an emergency meeting, I believe this body can make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9136)|
| 2:32:20| its rule however it wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9140)|
| 2:32:24| It says state of emergency, the matters of great public importance is kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9144)|
| 2:32:30| vague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9150)|
| 2:32:32| Clearly in a state of emergency, you ought to be able to convene a meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9152)|
| 2:32:38| almost immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9158)|
| 2:32:40| Like the fire, the building's burning down or there's a 9-11 thing hits, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9160)|
| 2:32:46| know, that's just my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9166)|
| 2:32:49| But it's this body can make its own rule on an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9169)|
| 2:32:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9173)|
| 2:32:54| Well, my recommendation would be for the Rules Committee just to eliminate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9174)|
| 2:32:58| one line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9178)|
| 2:33:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9180)|
| 2:33:01| So right now the motion is to move it forward without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9181)|
| 2:33:04| And if you were going to make a substitute motion, you would need to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9184)|
| 2:33:08| next week by amending the language or having the you could do that by having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9188)|
| 2:33:14| the rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9194)|
| 2:33:15| I mean, well, you'd have to go back to rules or you could do a friendly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9195)|
| 2:33:18| amendment at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9198)|
| 2:33:19| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9199)|
| 2:33:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9200)|
| 2:33:21| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9201)|
| 2:33:22| Commissioner Smith, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9202)|
| 2:33:28| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9208)|
| 2:33:31| I think this is a rule searching for a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9211)|
| 2:33:34| I agree wholeheartedly with Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9214)|
| 2:33:37| You know, what if you had a chairman go off the rails?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9217)|
| 2:33:42| Who's going to call a meeting to do anything about it if the mayor can't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9222)|
| 2:33:46| There are many circumstances having a risk management perspective where I can see the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9226)|
| 2:33:53| efficiency in having a mayor that's able to call a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9233)|
| 2:33:56| So, to be quite frankly, I'm going to vote against even moving this on without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9236)|
| 2:34:02| recommendation, because I don't think we really need to be spending time on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9242)|
| 2:34:08| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9248)|
| 2:34:09| Commissioner Daley, you're up next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9249)|
| 2:34:12| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9252)|
| 2:34:16| The my biggest concern of this is what is the emergency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9256)|
| 2:34:22| We do not have emergency defined here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9262)|
| 2:34:26| So if we can define what emergency is, is that a disaster like the fires in Gatlinburg?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9266)|
| 2:34:31| Is that a disaster at Concord Park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9271)|
| 2:34:34| Is that a disaster or an emergency that Mr. Caldwell can save us on bonds or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9274)|
| 2:34:42| and the bank's got to have an answer within a hurry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9282)|
| 2:34:44| Those are emergencies, but they're not defined what an emergency is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9284)|
| 2:34:51| And I would love to see that, and I brought this up in our rules committee meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9291)|
| 2:34:59| that let's define emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9299)|
| 2:35:02| Give us some type of parameter on what emergency meetings that the mayor can call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9302)|
| 2:35:08| or the chair of the commission can call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9308)|
| 2:35:11| We need to know what the definition, and Law Director Butte made the point plainly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9311)|
| 2:35:19| and I forgot what it is, David, I'm sorry, but we need to know what an emergency is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9319)|
| 2:35:24| and that would be very, very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9324)|
| 2:35:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9327)|
| 2:35:29| Thank you, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9329)|
| 2:35:31| I'm going to come back to you in a minute, Commissioner Bussler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9331)|
| 2:35:34| since you spoke at the beginning of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9334)|
| 2:35:36| I move to Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9336)|
| 2:35:38| Mr. Ward, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9338)|
| 2:35:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9340)|
| 2:35:41| I agree with Commissioner Buehler as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9341)|
| 2:35:44| I'm not quite sure how we got to this point, but the one problem I do have with defining an emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9344)|
| 2:35:50| is we can't know what's coming down the pipe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9350)|
| 2:35:54| Right now we're living in COVID world, and nobody saw this coming a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9354)|
| 2:36:00| So, I mean, I trust that our executor, you know, the people of Knoxville put him in there for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9360)|
| 2:36:07| I think he can decide what's an emergency and what's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9367)|
| 2:36:10| I'm afraid we're getting too deep into the woods and trying to box ourselves in where this isn't –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9370)|
| 2:36:17| I'd like to know why this even came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9377)|
| 2:36:19| I'm not even sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9379)|
| 2:36:21| I didn't know this was an issue to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9381)|
| 2:36:23| I'm kind of perplexed on that part of why we're even at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9383)|
| 2:36:29| Thank you, Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9389)|
| 2:36:31| Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9391)|
| 2:36:36| That was actually my reasoning for raising my hand, was is there an incident that has happened in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9396)|
| 2:36:44| you know, that has brought this to us today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9404)|
| 2:36:49| Just curious why this is on – what has happened to bring this to our agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9409)|
| 2:36:56| If there was anything in particular or if this was written ages ago and needs to be revamped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9416)|
| 2:37:03| like just what's the reasoning behind it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9423)|
| 2:37:06| Commissioner Buster, do you want to take that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9426)|
| 2:37:08| You brought this to the Rules Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9428)|
| 2:37:10| Yes, sir, I sure will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9430)|
| 2:37:12| First of all, there is a separation between executive power and commissioner powers about calling our meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9432)|
| 2:37:18| That's one of the things that we have in the separation of powers where you have an executive branch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9438)|
| 2:37:23| legislative branch, even a judicial branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9443)|
| 2:37:27| But the really thing that brought it to me, we only use this one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9447)|
| 2:37:31| And most of the commissioners, we make plans to go to these out-of-town meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9451)|
| 2:37:36| We were in – was it Nashville, I think, the last time we were down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9456)|
| 2:37:41| And we were in our meetings, and we were going to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9461)|
| 2:37:47| But there was an emergency meeting called by the mayor, and we came back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9467)|
| 2:37:52| and that's when Commissioner Daley's wife got hurt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9472)|
| 2:37:56| Some of us couldn't come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9476)|
| 2:37:59| And we all rushed back, and we lost time and money that we expanded in this meeting that we had at the TCCA meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9479)|
| 2:38:08| And we got back here for a reason that I thought was not an emergency meeting that we could have handled within a regular meeting basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9488)|
| 2:38:17| And so we all rushed back in a manner to get back to get to this meeting because it was called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9497)|
| 2:38:24| And I just think if you're going to have an emergency, let it be an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9504)|
| 2:38:32| Not where we're going to be hiring lawyers and not hiring lawyers or taking the duly elected official out of his duties as being law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9512)|
| 2:38:45| And that's what this did in the past, which some of you were not on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9525)|
| 2:38:50| And it bothered me that we would do that kind of emergency meeting when it really was not a disaster,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9530)|
| 2:38:58| which was not really life-threatening or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9538)|
| 2:39:02| So to me, it just bothered me that an executive member, by not defining what the emergency is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9542)|
| 2:39:12| could call any meeting he wants to if he can some way define the emergency as something not life-threatening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9552)|
| 2:39:20| And that's why I brought it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9560)|
| 2:39:23| We have powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9563)|
| 2:39:25| The commission has powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9565)|
| 2:39:27| The mayor has powers in the executive office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9567)|
| 2:39:30| So why do we want to combine the two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9570)|
| 2:39:33| We work with the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9573)|
| 2:39:35| In fact, if the chairman didn't decide it was an emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9575)|
| 2:39:39| we could in ourselves probably some way call a meeting in the commission themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9579)|
| 2:39:45| We have the chairman to lead us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9585)|
| 2:39:47| And hopefully he leads us in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9587)|
| 2:39:50| So that was my idea of bringing it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9590)|
| 2:39:52| We need to really define it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9592)|
| 2:39:54| We need to make sure that the separation of powers is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9594)|
| 2:39:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9597)|
| 2:39:59| Commissioner Daird, did you get your questions answered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9599)|
| 2:40:01| And would you like any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9601)|
| 2:40:03| Yes, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9603)|
| 2:40:05| Yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9605)|
| 2:40:06| I just, again, I wasn't, you know, I was just wanting to know the background behind this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9606)|
| 2:40:11| being that this is, you know, I'm very new and don't know what has happened in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9611)|
| 2:40:15| if anything had happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9615)|
| 2:40:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9618)|
| 2:40:19| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9619)|
| 2:40:20| Commissioner Daly, I'm going to call on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9620)|
| 2:40:22| I have a comment myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9622)|
| 2:40:23| And then I have a note that's come in that the mayor would also like to speak on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9623)|
| 2:40:28| So, Commissioner Daly, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9628)|
| 2:40:31| I'll defer to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9631)|
| 2:40:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9633)|
| 2:40:34| I'm going to come back and I'll add my comments after the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9634)|
| 2:40:38| Mayor Jacobs, are you with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9638)|
| 2:40:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9640)|
| 2:40:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9641)|
| 2:40:42| Thank you, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9642)|
| 2:40:44| To put a little context into why I called that special session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9644)|
| 2:40:49| the county was involved in a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9649)|
| 2:40:52| The chancellor, and we were trying to end that lawsuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9652)|
| 2:40:56| the chancellor who was on the bench had asked commission's opinion on withdrawing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9656)|
| 2:41:03| or stopping the lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9663)|
| 2:41:05| We had asked commission to add a resolution to the agenda showing their inclination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9665)|
| 2:41:12| whether to keep on the lawsuit or stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9672)|
| 2:41:15| And commission voted not to add it to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9675)|
| 2:41:18| So, in order to get the chancellor an answer before he ruled on the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9678)|
| 2:41:24| that's the reason that special session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9684)|
| 2:41:26| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9686)|
| 2:41:29| Thank you, Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9689)|
| 2:41:30| Commissioner Daly, I'll defer to you and then I'll add after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9690)|
| 2:41:34| Yeah, I just kind of tried to answer Kyle's, I'm sorry, Commissioner Ward's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9694)|
| 2:41:39| Rules Committee is set up to look at our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9699)|
| 2:41:44| And if someone feels that a rule needs to be looked at, not necessarily changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9704)|
| 2:41:49| but to be looked at, it can be brought to the Rules Committee by the chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9709)|
| 2:41:53| or one of the Rules Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9713)|
| 2:41:55| We'll have the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9715)|
| 2:41:56| We'll discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9716)|
| 2:41:57| If it makes it out of Rules Committee, comes to commission, it's up or down vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9717)|
| 2:42:02| six votes, it'll take whatever how the motion is, up or down, takes six votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9722)|
| 2:42:06| And that's why, you know, that's what we're here for on the Rules Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9726)|
| 2:42:09| is to look at our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9729)|
| 2:42:12| And we've changed some already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9732)|
| 2:42:13| We changed public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9733)|
| 2:42:15| I think it's working very, very well in public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9735)|
| 2:42:18| So, sometimes we look at rules we don't change, but then we look at the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9738)|
| 2:42:23| and we've changed and it's for the good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9743)|
| 2:42:25| So, hopefully that kind of gives you an idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9745)|
| 2:42:29| Thank you, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9749)|
| 2:42:32| Commissioner, I'll defer to Commissioner Biggs before making comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9752)|
| 2:42:35| Commissioner Biggs, you're up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9755)|
| 2:42:37| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9757)|
| 2:42:39| Can I make a substitute motion on top of the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9759)|
| 2:42:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9762)|
| 2:42:43| No, the substitute motion has to be acted on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9763)|
| 2:42:47| Then it would go back to the original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9767)|
| 2:42:50| Now, when we go back to the original, you might be able to do it again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9770)|
| 2:42:53| but let's go through the first swing of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9773)|
| 2:42:56| I want to add my comments to this as Commissioner in seat 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9776)|
| 2:43:02| I was one who voted against this in the Rules Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9782)|
| 2:43:05| I didn't think it was necessary, and I don't think that it's something that we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9785)|
| 2:43:11| I'm not in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9791)|
| 2:43:12| I think even if, you know, if you play out every scenario,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9792)|
| 2:43:15| if a mayor egregiously uses power to call a meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9795)|
| 2:43:19| and the commissioners don't think it's an emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9799)|
| 2:43:22| then the commissioners don't have to come back for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9802)|
| 2:43:24| I mean, if a mayor said, I have an emergency thing that I really want to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9804)|
| 2:43:28| and we all felt like it wasn't an emergency, then we could all say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9808)|
| 2:43:33| great, you can have your meeting, but we're not going to show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9813)|
| 2:43:37| I think that we need to give a little bit of leeway to the people that lead both our county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9817)|
| 2:43:42| on the executive and legislative level to make good, sound decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9822)|
| 2:43:46| And I do think it's a solution looking for a problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9826)|
| 2:43:50| and it hasn't been something that has been egregiously abused,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9830)|
| 2:43:53| and I'm not in favor of it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9833)|
| 2:43:55| So I will likely vote against the substitute motion to even move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9835)|
| 2:44:00| and certainly against the approval to move past tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9840)|
| 2:44:03| I think we can move on, and we have plenty of checks and balances between our bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9843)|
| 2:44:08| So I will finish back where we began with Commissioner Beeler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9848)|
| 2:44:12| who currently has a substitute motion on the table to move forward without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9852)|
| 2:44:17| Commissioner Beeler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9857)|
| 2:44:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9858)|
| 2:44:20| Since this is an open meeting and not a poker game,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9860)|
| 2:44:23| and Commissioner Biggs is the second on my substitute motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9863)|
| 2:44:27| I would be interested to know what his thoughts were on offering another substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9867)|
| 2:44:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9873)|
| 2:44:35| I mean, just kind of echoing what Chairman Jay said, I was thinking maybe send it back to rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9875)|
| 2:44:43| It sounds like there's some stuff in there, but kind of what he's saying, you know, just kill it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9883)|
| 2:44:49| I think your options are you could vote on the substitute motion to move forward without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9889)|
| 2:44:55| That would either pass and move forward, and we vote on it next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9895)|
| 2:44:59| It would fail, and we would go back to the original motion to approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9899)|
| 2:45:04| and either that would pass or fail, or you could amend your substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9904)|
| 2:45:10| Well, if you ended up amending that, you would end up back in the same spot either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9910)|
| 2:45:14| So you could rescind your substitute motion and just go with the vote as the original motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9914)|
| 2:45:21| or you could go ahead with your substitute motion and kick it to next week and then vote on it with more discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9921)|
| 2:45:27| I'll keep it on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9927)|
| 2:45:28| We'll see how the two votes go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9928)|
| 2:45:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9930)|
| 2:45:31| So the motion on the floor, I'm seeing no other hands raised right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9931)|
| 2:45:35| is a substitute motion which would move this resolution forward without recommendation to be voted on next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9935)|
| 2:45:44| Is that clear to everyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9944)|
| 2:45:47| You're voting yes, it gets moved to next week, and we vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9947)|
| 2:45:50| If you vote no, then we go back to the original motion to approve, and we deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9950)|
| 2:45:55| So yes, next week, no, we're going backwards, and we're going to do round two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9955)|
| 2:46:01| Mr. Clerk, would you please call the roll on the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9961)|
| 2:46:05| Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9965)|
| 2:46:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9967)|
| 2:46:09| Commissioner Daley votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9969)|
| 2:46:10| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9970)|
| 2:46:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9971)|
| 2:46:12| Commissioner Jay votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9972)|

| 2:46:17| Commissioner Lundy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9977)|
| 2:46:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9978)|
| 2:46:19| Commissioner Lundy votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9979)|
| 2:46:20| Commissioner Durrett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9980)|
| 2:46:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9982)|
| 2:46:23| Commissioner Durrett votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9983)|
| 2:46:24| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9984)|
| 2:46:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9985)|
| 2:46:27| Commissioner Smith votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9987)|
| 2:46:28| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9988)|
| 2:46:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9989)|
| 2:46:30| Commissioner Ward votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9990)|
| 2:46:32| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9992)|
| 2:46:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9993)|
| 2:46:34| Commissioner Schoonmaker votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9994)|
| 2:46:36| Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9996)|
| 2:46:38| I am passing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=9998)|
| 2:46:41| I just, this second, got back on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10001)|
| 2:46:43| I have missed everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10003)|
| 2:46:45| Commissioner Hill passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10005)|
| 2:46:46| Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10006)|
| 2:46:47| Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10007)|
| 2:46:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10008)|
| 2:46:49| Commissioner Bussler votes aye. Commissioner Buehler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10009)|
| 2:46:53| I can't hear him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10013)|
| 2:46:58| You're muted, Commissioner Buehler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10018)|
| 2:46:59| My apologies, Mr. Chairman. I pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10019)|
| 2:47:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10023)|
| 2:47:04| And Commissioner Buehler passes. That is two passes, one, two, three, four, five noes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10024)|
| 2:47:11| four ayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10031)|
| 2:47:12| Do the passes wish to vote? This is the vote, just to reiterate, is a substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10032)|
| 2:47:20| to move forward without recommendation to next week. Do either of the passes wish to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10040)|
| 2:47:24| vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10044)|
| 2:47:25| May I, Chair, given I missed all of this, ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10045)|
| 2:47:32| Yes, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10052)|
| 2:47:36| So, if we move to next week, okay, tell me again, what are we voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10056)|
| 2:47:42| We have a substitute. The original motion was to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10062)|
| 2:47:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10065)|
| 2:47:46| We have a substitute motion to move forward without recommendation to next week. That| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10066)|
| 2:47:50| is what we're voting on right now. If you vote yes, we will then move this discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10070)|
| 2:47:55| to next week, and we will have an up or down vote then, or any amendments to that vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10075)|
| 2:47:59| If you vote no, then we will go back to the original motion, which will either approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10079)|
| 2:48:04| it, and it will go on the consent calendar, or disapprove it, and it goes nowhere. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10084)|
| 2:48:10| right now, you're just voting on, do you want to move it forward to next week and vote then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10090)|
| 2:48:13| or do you want to kind of go back and vote today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10093)|
| 2:48:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10096)|
| 2:48:17| So, your vote would be a yes vote. So, that would be five and five. Does the other pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10097)|
| 2:48:24| wish to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10104)|
| 2:48:25| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10105)|
| 2:48:26| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10106)|
| 2:48:27| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10107)|
| 2:48:28| I got confused. My vote's no. Can I change my vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10108)|
| 2:48:33| Yes, sir. Commissioner Biggs would like to vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10113)|
| 2:48:37| It goes back to the original form, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10117)|
| 2:48:40| So, that would be, if I understand the crowd, that is a vote of six to four, with one pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10120)|
| 2:48:46| Is that accurate, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10126)|
| 2:48:50| That means that it goes back to its original form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10130)|
| 2:48:52| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10132)|
| 2:48:53| Okay. I got confused there for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10133)|
| 2:48:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10135)|
| 2:48:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10136)|
| 2:48:57| Well, no, not yes. No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10137)|
| 2:48:58| Just stop talking. That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10138)|
| 2:49:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10141)|
| 2:49:02| So, Mr. Clerk, am I accurate in that we have six no votes on the substitute motion, four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10142)|
| 2:49:09| yes votes, and one pass?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10149)|
| 2:49:10| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10150)|
| 2:49:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10151)|
| 2:49:12| Okay. So, that, anybody else wish to change their vote on the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10152)|
| 2:49:18| I just have a question. Did the maker of the motion pass?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10158)|
| 2:49:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10161)|
| 2:49:22| Yes, Commissioner. The maker of the motion passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10162)|
| 2:49:28| Okay. Seeing nobody changing their votes, that substitute motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10168)|
| 2:49:33| I believe the pass is recorded as a no, as the pass goes with the prevailing side. Is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10173)|
| 2:49:40| that correct, Mr. Clerk? I think that's how it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10180)|
| 2:49:44| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10184)|
| 2:49:45| So, that would be, that substitute motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10185)|
| 2:49:49| We will now go back to the original motion, which was made by Commissioner Busler, with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10189)|
| 2:49:53| a second by Commissioner Daley. And that is a motion to approve Resolution Number 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10193)|
| 2:50:01| Is there additional discussion on the motion before we go for a vote? And I see Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10201)|
| 2:50:06| Biggs, your hand is up, but it may be unbinded from before. Okay. Any further discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10206)|
| 2:50:12| on Resolution 905 before we proceed to a vote? Yes, sir. Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10212)|
| 2:50:17| Thank you, Mr. Chair. Again, I will be voting no on this resolution and potential rule change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10217)|
| 2:50:27| Excuse me. Thank you, Commissioner Smith. Any further discussion? Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10227)|
| 2:50:33| Thank you, Mr. Chair. The reason why I brought this up is, remember, it's our commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10233)|
| 2:50:40| and the way we do it, and we're setting our rules. Maybe we need to change the definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10240)|
| 2:50:46| of what an emergency is. Yeah. But there again, it's so broad that we don't call it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10246)|
| 2:50:57| for any reason. And most of us, like you said, we just don't have to show up. But most of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10257)|
| 2:51:02| us have been voted in by the people of our districts and in our county. And if there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10262)|
| 2:51:07| a meeting called, we're expected to be there. If we don't show up, then there's a reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10267)|
| 2:51:13| we're just not representing our district or the people of Knox County. But I do think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10273)|
| 2:51:19| it's important to know that we are the legislative branch, and that we ought to be able to control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10279)|
| 2:51:26| our own agenda. And we're not if we just leave this so broad the way it is. So what do you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10286)|
| 2:51:33| want to do? You want to make it a kind of a, I don't know, kind of a, I'm just going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10293)|
| 2:51:42| to leave it there. I'm not going to tell you what I think it is. But anyway, thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10302)|
| 2:51:46| you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10306)|
| 2:51:47| Thank you, Commissioner Bessler. Any other discussion before we move on the vote on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10307)|
| 2:51:50| motion? Commissioner Schiff, your hand's still raised, but I think that was from before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10310)|
| 2:51:58| So I'm going to assume that's not unless I see otherwise. Okay, what you are voting on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10318)|
| 2:52:03| is a motion to approve Resolution 905. Yes vote means it will be part of our rule changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10323)|
| 2:52:10| as written in the red line agreement. No means it will not be part of our rules. Claire?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10330)|
| 2:52:17| Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10337)|
| 2:52:20| Commissioner Jay? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10340)|

| 2:52:53| Commissioner Beeler votes no. Commissioner Daly? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10373)|
| 2:52:57| Commissioner Daly votes yes. We have two aye votes and nine no votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10377)|
| 2:53:03| Anybody wish to change their vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10383)|
| 2:53:07| Seeing none, the vote is nine to two. The motion fails on 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10387)|
| 2:53:14| I'd like to propose to everybody another 10-minute break before we move to the next ordinance. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10394)|
| 2:53:20| think that is going to be a large discussion. And it is now 8.02. So I'm actually going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10400)|
| 2:53:25| let's call this a 15-minute. So we will, I'm going to put this meeting, there's no gavel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10405)|
| 2:53:32| so I'm going to put this meeting into recess until 8.17. Durrett, I think is around, Ward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10412)|
| 2:53:41| Biggs, Schoonmaker, Bessler, Hill. All right. I think we have everybody in. We'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10421)|
| 2:53:50| gavel us back out of recess. And we had concluded item number 40 a moment ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10430)|
| 2:53:58| Mr. Clerk, if you would please call the next item. This is page 7, item 41.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10438)|
| 2:54:06| Consideration of an ordinance of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee, amending Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10446)|

| 2:54:19| entitled County Board of Health to provide for the Board of Health to serve as an advisory board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10459)|
| 2:54:26| to the Knox County Health Department. This is ordinance 20-12-101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10466)|
| 2:54:32| Before I look to the sponsor for a motion, I want to ask our law department to clarify on ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10472)|
| 2:54:41| This is an ordinance that requires two readings. I guess I'm going to say something and correct me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10481)|
| 2:54:47| if I'm wrong, our law director and law team. It's an ordinance that requires two readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10487)|
| 2:54:53| The first reading would need to pass and has to pass with a simple majority. And if it moves past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10493)|
| 2:55:00| the first reading, it would go to a second meeting, which would require a two-thirds vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10500)|
| 2:55:04| Is that accurate? No, majority on both votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10504)|
| 2:55:08| Majority on both votes. Is there a reason that the next item, number 42, has a two-thirds vote under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10508)|
| 2:55:16| it? That's because that thing was provided by statute. You could put that non-smoking provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10516)|
| 2:55:24| Statute said it had to pass by two-thirds vote. Okay. Thank you very much for the clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10524)|
| 2:55:30| Okay. Item number 41 has been read. Commissioner Ward is the sponsor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10530)|
| 2:55:36| I'll look to a motion from you before we open it up for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10536)|
| 2:55:41| Motion to approve. Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10541)|
| 2:55:49| Clarification. Does an ordinance not need a? I think it's move forward without recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10549)|
| 2:55:53| would be the proper. Motion to move forward without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10553)|
| 2:55:56| Okay. Sorry. Is that where you're heading, Commissioner Beeler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10556)|
| 2:55:59| Yes. Yes. And I'll second it. Motion to move forward by commission without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10559)|
| 2:56:04| recommendation by Commissioner Ward with a second by Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10564)|
| 2:56:08| And I will open it up to the floor to the sponsor to begin the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10568)|
| 2:56:14| Thank you, sir. I've got a couple of notes here. Usually not a talkative one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10574)|
| 2:56:21| but tonight I've got a couple of things that go down and keep my brain focused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10581)|
| 2:56:28| First off, over the last two weeks since I put this on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10588)|
| 2:56:34| I've gotten to talk to a lot of my family that's in the middle of the field and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10594)|
| 2:56:42| lots of friends and people I referred to. I think I was close to about 100 nurses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10602)|
| 2:56:49| doctors, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants, hospital administrators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10609)|
| 2:56:56| that I talked to. I don't think I got to quite 100, but I got up there in a pretty high count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10616)|
| 2:57:00| But the three things I took away mostly is, A, these people are working their butts off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10620)|
| 2:57:08| They're right in the middle of it, first-line people, and they really are heroes, and they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10628)|
| 2:57:13| working super hard on everything. And I want to make sure that they're recognized for their hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10633)|
| 2:57:20| work. Secondly, what a lot of people said, even my own doctor, this is very much a real thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10640)|
| 2:57:29| and it can affect all ages. It doesn't matter, sexes, race, anything. It can happen to anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10649)|
| 2:57:37| And we need to take it serious. And the third thing is the five core actions was a big thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10657)|
| 2:57:43| that everybody wanted to promote. And along with me, I've said it pretty much in all my statements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10663)|
| 2:57:49| that were released that I really want everybody to take the five core actions serious. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10669)|
| 2:57:56| you know, this has been made into an anti-mask thing, which is disappointing because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10676)|
| 2:58:00| I wear a mask in public. I don't know why we went down that route that this became| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10680)|
| 2:58:06| a political weapon, but it has, unfortunately. So those are the three things from what I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10686)|
| 2:58:12| been gathering from everybody. I want to also set kind of the record straight. We had some people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10692)|
| 2:58:18| that talked tonight that I think might have been a little confused on what this resolution or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10698)|

| 2:58:28| that we have with the current members that we have and making them basically into an advisory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10708)|
| 2:58:33| board instead of a board that can set mandates and policies. So it's not getting rid of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10713)|
| 2:58:40| They're going to stay there. The power will then go to the health departments and the health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10720)|
| 2:58:46| department. They'll be making decisions. The health department has been on the health board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10726)|
| 2:58:51| I'm fairly positive. I'm not 100% sure, but 99% sure that all the mask mandates and all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10731)|
| 2:58:58| mandates that are currently happening will probably be carried forward since the head of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10738)|
| 2:59:03| the health department has voted for them in the past. So I don't think there's going to be any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10743)|
| 2:59:07| major changes to the way everything's running. I also want to say for decades now, the health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10747)|
| 2:59:14| department has handled every single health issue that we've had for 50, 60, however long the health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10754)|

| 2:59:25| The health board is running point, not the health department. So I don't understand why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10765)|
| 2:59:31| we didn't change this back in June when the, I wasn't around then, but when the original| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10771)|
| 2:59:37| interpretation of the law was that the health board's in charge, not the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10777)|
| 2:59:42| So basically I'm a constitutional conservative. For me, this was always about the constitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10782)|
| 2:59:48| and being constitutional conservative and had nothing to do with mask mandates or any of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10788)|
| 2:59:52| other stuff. Plain and simple, I think it should be changed for this reason in this way. So right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10792)|
| 3:00:00| now that's the only comments I have. And I might say something more later, but that's about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10800)|

| 3:00:12| Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'm bringing up some things about what the health board's saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10812)|
| 3:00:22| And one of the health board members said nine months ago when we could have done something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10822)|
| 3:00:26| about it, we didn't do anything at all. Well, this virus that we've had in Knoxville, COVID-19,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10826)|
| 3:00:34| has been around probably since October because I know my daughter, her family, and her husband| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10834)|
| 3:00:43| had a flu-like symptom. They couldn't figure out what it was. It was causing problems, but they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10843)|
| 3:00:49| treated it sort of like the flu and it affected some differently than it did the others. So in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10849)|
| 3:00:55| my family's instance, the flu, this COVID-19 has probably been around, I know, probably since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10855)|
| 3:01:02| October of last year. So it's been here over a year. And those were popping up all over the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10862)|
| 3:01:09| people going that had flu symptoms, but they couldn't diagnose it or get it as flu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10869)|
| 3:01:15| And I'm not a doctor, I'm not saying that, but it just seems that we've been around. The WHO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10875)|
| 3:01:20| which is World Organization, which had the opportunity to let us know that that flu was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10880)|
| 3:01:27| around a lot longer. And my whole thing about the health board and everybody else is we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10887)|
| 3:01:33| to bring everybody together and get them on one page, which was not done. It was not done. They| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10893)|
| 3:01:41| didn't get us all on the same page telling us what was really happening. You know, it didn't start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10901)|
| 3:01:48| nine months ago, it started a lot longer than that. And why didn't we know that? We were getting those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10908)|
| 3:01:54| things around the county then. So I've got some problems. I don't know how I'm going to vote on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10914)|
| 3:02:01| this yet. But we do have problems that we're not getting people on the page to work together. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10921)|
| 3:02:08| we're splitting people right now. And I heard some other people when they were talking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10928)|
| 3:02:14| And I wrote these notes down. The arrogance that some of the people, the way they talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10934)|
| 3:02:23| about some of these people about not wearing masks, treating people differently, and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10943)|
| 3:02:29| indifference in how they treat people. And I see this heading out to all of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10949)|
| 3:02:36| And no matter what you do, no matter what you try to do to protect yourself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10956)|
| 3:02:42| it will catch up with you. Once the horse is out of the barn, which it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10962)|
| 3:02:46| the horses are out. We're not going to catch up with it. And you cannot get rid of a virus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10966)|
| 3:02:53| you can only control it. So what we've got to do is try to protect our economy and try to protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10973)|
| 3:03:01| our mental health. And try to protect and let people know what they have to do to protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10981)|
| 3:03:08| themselves. And those three things are not happening. So again, I don't know how I'm going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10988)|
| 3:03:13| to vote on this. But I think we ought to just really look at how this was really treated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10993)|
| 3:03:18| Thank you. Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=10998)|

| 3:03:38| to change directions. But I'm ready to change directions tonight. Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11018)|
| 3:03:49| if the health board has made an advisory board only, which I think was to full intent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11029)|
| 3:03:54| and Dr. Buchanan will have 100% control of all regulations and mandates, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11034)|
| 3:04:01| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11041)|
| 3:04:02| If Dr. Buchanan can close, Dr. Buchanan will have the power to close a business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11042)|
| 3:04:07| or businesses early or completely as she deems necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11047)|
| 3:04:12| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11052)|
| 3:04:14| Dr. Buchanan can issue a mask mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11054)|

| 3:08:20| I appreciate your staff over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11300)|
| 3:08:22| I know they work hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11302)|
| 3:08:24| Everybody's tired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11304)|
| 3:08:26| The way we're going to defeat this is that vaccine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11306)|
| 3:08:29| God above and the good Lord Jesus Christ, let's get this vaccine to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11309)|
| 3:08:33| We get 100, 200 million people, then we're going to defeat this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11313)|
| 3:08:38| But it's time to stop this board from doing what they're doing, reaching out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11318)|
| 3:08:42| Now they're wanting to reach out and take control of surrounding counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11322)|
| 3:08:48| And the other mandate, they will not forget which order it is, 17 or 16?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11328)|
| 3:08:54| 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11334)|
| 3:08:55| 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11335)|
| 3:08:56| Now they're wanting to close their businesses down again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11336)|
| 3:08:58| 100% close your businesses down again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11338)|
| 3:09:01| Come on, people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11341)|
| 3:09:02| I mean, time is time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11342)|
| 3:09:05| And I've already told you how I'm going to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11345)|
| 3:09:08| So I am so...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11348)|
| 3:09:15| We've made this county and this country divided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11355)|
| 3:09:21| on an issue that we should use the governor to rule on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11361)|
| 3:09:25| Live by the governor rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11365)|
| 3:09:28| Do the five core actions and we'll get through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11368)|
| 3:09:31| But don't overreach your power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11371)|
| 3:09:35| So I am going to be voting yes on...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11375)|
| 3:09:38| And on Mr. Ward's changing the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11378)|
| 3:09:44| there's still going to be a board, advisory board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11384)|
| 3:09:46| They're going to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11386)|
| 3:09:47| They're going to advise Dr. Buchanan on what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11387)|
| 3:09:50| Dr. Buchanan can take that advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11390)|
| 3:09:54| And I think, correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11394)|
| 3:09:59| but Dr. Buchanan, she could probably ask for some type of resolution to the board saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11399)|
| 3:10:09| hey, I think this is what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11409)|
| 3:10:12| We need to close businesses at 9 o'clock instead of 10 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11412)|
| 3:10:16| They can discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11416)|
| 3:10:17| They can vote on it and send it back to Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11417)|
| 3:10:20| I think Dr. Buchanan even has a vote on that there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11420)|
| 3:10:23| Dr. Buchanan, Dr. B, can take their advice or she can make it more stringent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11423)|
| 3:10:31| And I think, Dr. Buchanan, I'll be praying for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11431)|
| 3:10:35| But I think this decision needs to go back to the health director of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11435)|
| 3:10:42| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11442)|
| 3:10:43| Thank you, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11443)|
| 3:10:46| Director Book, I see you have your hand raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11446)|
| 3:10:48| Did you want to weigh in before we go for additional comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11448)|
| 3:10:51| Yeah, I wanted to follow up on what Commissioner Daley said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11451)|
| 3:10:57| When Commissioner Ward came to me, this is not something that just flew together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11457)|
| 3:11:03| I did a lot of research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11463)|
| 3:11:04| There was a lot of discussion with several commissioners on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11464)|
| 3:11:11| The way the statute was written, that's why the Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11471)|
| 3:11:16| took over the duties of the health director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11476)|
| 3:11:22| I have the utmost confidence in Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11482)|
| 3:11:26| I respect her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11486)|
| 3:11:28| She's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11488)|
| 3:11:29| She knows what she's doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11489)|
| 3:11:31| And she has the health of Knox County utmost in her mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11491)|
| 3:11:34| And I wish her a happy recovery or a soon recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11494)|
| 3:11:38| But when I did this together, when I put it together, I researched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11498)|
| 3:11:43| Number one, Memphis, Shelby County didn't have a Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11503)|
| 3:11:47| They were making their decisions based on the Governor's Executive Order 38,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11507)|
| 3:11:55| which says that in these six counties, of which we were one, the health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11515)|
| 3:12:00| the health department shall make decisions, regulations, and orders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11520)|
| 3:12:06| So that's why if the health department can continue on, if the Board of Health is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11526)|
| 3:12:14| this is repealed and the Board of Health becomes advisory in nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11534)|
| 3:12:18| then Dr. Buchanan can do what she's supposed to do under the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11538)|
| 3:12:23| She is both the health director and the health officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11543)|
| 3:12:26| She knows what she's doing, and she has a tremendous staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11546)|
| 3:12:31| So all of that went into coming up with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11551)|
| 3:12:35| proposed ordinance that was requested by Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11555)|
| 3:12:40| So I think on the one hand, it's a disservice to a very fine and dedicated public servant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11560)|
| 3:12:49| Dr. Buchanan, to make her rely strictly upon mandates that are coming from an unelected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11569)|
| 3:12:55| unappointed board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11575)|
| 3:12:57| And she's answerable to the commissioner in Nashville, and she's answerable to the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11577)|
| 3:13:04| and she's answerable directly to these citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11584)|
| 3:13:06| And I'm not saying the Board of Health is bad by any means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11586)|
| 3:13:09| I think they think they're doing what they need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11589)|
| 3:13:12| That's not the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11592)|
| 3:13:13| So I just wanted you to know what went into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11593)|
| 3:13:16| And also, and if the mayor's still on, I think when I talked to the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11596)|
| 3:13:20| he indicated that in his conversations, at least in Hamilton County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11600)|
| 3:13:29| that they didn't even use the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11609)|
| 3:13:33| The county mayor and the health director were making their decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11613)|
| 3:13:38| That's what he told me, and he can correct me if he's still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11618)|
| 3:13:41| So at least two counties weren't using the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11621)|
| 3:13:44| I don't know about the other four counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11624)|
| 3:13:47| But we have, and that's what this Kyle Wards, when he went through this and we discussed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11627)|
| 3:13:54| and he was very concerned, he wanted to make sure that Dr. Buchanan was not disrespected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11634)|
| 3:14:00| and that she was the one that was going to continue to make these decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11640)|
| 3:14:04| So that's the genesis of the wording of this proposed ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11644)|
| 3:14:10| I'm going to, I see a comment, or I see a hand raise from Commissioner Zelandi,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11650)|
| 3:14:17| Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11657)|
| 3:14:18| I'm going to ask one question while the law director is still kind of with us in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11658)|
| 3:14:25| Can I ask for some clarification of when we started this pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11665)|
| 3:14:30| we operated under that premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11670)|
| 3:14:32| And at some point this spring, the law director and the law department, which you were part of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11672)|
| 3:14:38| said that that was inaccurate and that the board had to make those policy decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11678)|
| 3:14:42| Can you explain how we started this way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11682)|
| 3:14:46| We went to a different way based upon the opinion of our law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11686)|
| 3:14:49| and now we're being given back the advice of, to go back to the original way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11689)|
| 3:14:54| I'm not giving any advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11694)|
| 3:14:56| That's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11696)|
| 3:14:57| It's a policy decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11697)|
| 3:14:58| What happened was, there was this, there was some kind of a task force that God knows where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11698)|
| 3:15:06| it started or who started it, that was making all of these what the Board of Health is doing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11706)|
| 3:15:14| And they didn't even want to have public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11714)|
| 3:15:16| Our office said, look, if you're going to use a task force, number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11716)|
| 3:15:20| it's got to be duly set up, which it hasn't been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11720)|
| 3:15:22| And number two, they refused to have public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11722)|
| 3:15:25| And they argued about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11725)|
| 3:15:26| And they said, no, no, we don't have to have public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11726)|
| 3:15:29| And we said, yes, you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11729)|
| 3:15:31| So we kept looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11731)|
| 3:15:32| And then as we read the statute more, the Board of Health, which had only been convened quarterly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11732)|
| 3:15:38| for budgetary purposes, the statute said the Board of Health shall make policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11738)|
| 3:15:44| So here we were between a body that was not in any way legitimate, holding private meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11744)|
| 3:15:53| as opposed to what the statute said, which is let's have a Board of Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11753)|
| 3:15:56| which would be required to have public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11756)|
| 3:15:59| And it said it shall make policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11759)|
| 3:16:01| And then the health director shall carry out the policy of the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11761)|
| 3:16:06| When we read that, we submitted that and said, evidently, this is the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11766)|
| 3:16:11| So it wasn't a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11771)|
| 3:16:13| It was a statement of what the law said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11773)|
| 3:16:15| And I'm not making an opinion one way or the other on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11775)|
| 3:16:18| I've just been asked to state what the law was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11778)|
| 3:16:20| And I've been asked by Commissioner Ward to come up with an amendment to the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11780)|
| 3:16:29| that would meet what he deems to be proper, which is to put it back in the hands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11789)|
| 3:16:34| of the health director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11794)|
| 3:16:35| Thank you, Director Book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11795)|
| 3:16:37| Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11797)|
| 3:16:43| Well, here we go again, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11803)|
| 3:16:45| I hate that we're in this situation that we continue to go back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11805)|
| 3:16:49| And I agree with Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11809)|
| 3:16:53| This has been a great divide in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11813)|
| 3:16:56| And I don't even know if there's a perfect answer or a perfect way to solve this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11816)|
| 3:17:01| I just wish that we can get back to humanizing people and not demonizing people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11821)|
| 3:17:08| The Board of Health, I know, has done a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11828)|
| 3:17:11| It's been hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11831)|
| 3:17:12| No one knew we were going to be in a pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11832)|
| 3:17:15| I didn't know we was going to be in a pandemic when I was running for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11835)|
| 3:17:19| As far as this ordinance, I'm not supporting it just based on just my general principle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11839)|
| 3:17:31| But I do have a question about, so I understand that Dr. Buchanan will be the sole policymaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11851)|
| 3:17:40| So will Mayor Jacobs have any decision on anything related to the policies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11860)|
| 3:17:49| Health policies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11869)|
| 3:17:54| I'm asking a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11874)|
| 3:17:59| You're asking me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11879)|
| 3:17:59| Who are you asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11879)|
| 3:18:00| Oh, whoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11880)|
| 3:18:01| I don't know if it's law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11881)|
| 3:18:04| I just want to clarify because I know I get thousands of emails that people are so worried| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11884)|
| 3:18:08| about people who are not in the medical profession making decisions on the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11888)|
| 3:18:16| No, the Executive Order 38 says specifically, the six locally run county health departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11896)|
| 3:18:23| in Davidson, Hamilton, Knox, Madison, Shelby, and Sullivan County shall have authority to issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11903)|
| 3:18:29| additional orders or measures related to containment of management of the spread of COVID-19| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11909)|
| 3:18:36| through their health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11916)|
| 3:18:39| And that's what they say, the county health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11919)|
| 3:18:41| So no, the mayor doesn't control the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11921)|
| 3:18:45| He has a say only in the appointment of the health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11925)|
| 3:18:50| Got to consider there are two offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11930)|
| 3:18:52| There's a health director, which is not a doctor necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11932)|
| 3:18:57| And then there's a health officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11937)|
| 3:18:59| Dr. Buchanan in Knox County as of maybe six years ago or so has assumed both of those roles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11939)|
| 3:19:07| So all that the mayor has in that is a say in the appointment by the commissioner of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11947)|
| 3:19:14| health director, then he also chooses and hires the health officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11954)|
| 3:19:23| So those two positions, but the health department under this executive order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11963)|
| 3:19:29| is the one that will make the decision, not the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11969)|
| 3:19:33| Okay, I just want to follow up with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11973)|
| 3:19:35| Okay, so Dr. Buchanan has the authority to make the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11975)|
| 3:19:41| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11981)|
| 3:19:41| We got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11981)|
| 3:19:42| We're clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11982)|
| 3:19:43| So if our mayor does not agree, can he, I guess, veto that policy or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11983)|
| 3:19:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11994)|
| 3:19:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11994)|
| 3:19:55| I just want to make sure on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=11995)|
| 3:20:00| And the other issues that I have is just more, I noticed that we took out the city mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12000)|
| 3:20:08| not being a part of the advisory committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12008)|
| 3:20:11| And that's the main thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12011)|
| 3:20:12| I really wish we can come together as a city and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12012)|
| 3:20:15| I hate that we haven't come to the place that maybe our city mayor and our county mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12015)|
| 3:20:21| and city council and county commissioner can come together on such a hard issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12021)|
| 3:20:27| because it affects all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12027)|
| 3:20:28| And I just wish we can do a better job at finding different ways to lead our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12028)|
| 3:20:36| And that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12036)|
| 3:20:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12036)|
| 3:20:38| Thank you, Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12038)|
| 3:20:39| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12039)|
| 3:20:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12040)|
| 3:20:43| These comments probably are to Commissioner Ward then just because back to the nuts and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12043)|
| 3:20:49| bolts of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12049)|
| 3:20:52| It's my understanding that, well, first off, you know, I think the public through social| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12052)|
| 3:20:59| media has really confused the definition of the health department and the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12059)|
| 3:21:05| For some reason, they think that they're one and the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12065)|
| 3:21:08| And as we know, they are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12068)|
| 3:21:11| But I know you've done a lot of research before you did this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12071)|
| 3:21:16| And right now in Tennessee, we have 89 counties that are controlled by the state of Tennessee's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12076)|
| 3:21:25| Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12085)|
| 3:21:27| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12087)|
| 3:21:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12088)|
| 3:21:29| And we have six counties that have the option to have boards of health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12089)|
| 3:21:36| And it's my understanding that five of those six counties, they are advisory only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12096)|
| 3:21:42| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12102)|
| 3:21:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12104)|
| 3:21:46| So Knox County is the only county out of 95 counties in the entire state that has a board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12106)|
| 3:21:53| of health that is making mandates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12113)|
| 3:21:57| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12117)|
| 3:21:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12118)|
| 3:21:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12119)|
| 3:22:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12120)|
| 3:22:02| So in other words, the purpose of your ordinance is basically to bring this into compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12122)|
| 3:22:09| with all the other counties in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12129)|
| 3:22:12| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12132)|
| 3:22:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12133)|
| 3:22:15| And then, Law Director Book, I'm very concerned about the possibility where we've had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12135)|
| 3:22:26| independent Board of Health mandating decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12146)|
| 3:22:30| And I look at Tennessee Code 29-2201, which is the Governmental Tort Liability Act of 1973,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12150)|
| 3:22:40| which potentially could hold Knox County extremely liable for lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12160)|
| 3:22:48| So if we moved in this direction to an advisory panel, would that reduce our risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12168)|
| 3:22:55| of and go back to the immunity that that code allows us to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12175)|
| 3:23:07| You raise a question that I didn't look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12187)|
| 3:23:10| But under the GTLA, the Government Tort Liability Act and the protection and immunity it has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12190)|
| 3:23:18| off the top of my head, I'd say it would put it more in line with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12198)|
| 3:23:23| GTLA protections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12203)|
| 3:23:24| But I can't give you a definitive answer because I haven't researched that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12204)|
| 3:23:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12209)|
| 3:23:30| Because currently, and just to use an analogy, if the governor in his executive order says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12210)|
| 3:23:40| he wants the 89 counties to do A, B, and C, and if we do A, B, and C, and we're sued locally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12220)|
| 3:23:51| that lawsuit then flips right to Nashville and we don't have any problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12231)|
| 3:23:55| We have no jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12235)|
| 3:23:57| The state automatically handles that lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12237)|
| 3:23:59| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12239)|
| 3:24:00| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12240)|
| 3:24:01| And the law director's office, prior to my being elected law director, took that position that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12241)|
| 3:24:07| if you followed the executive orders of the governor, then somebody that wanted to sue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12247)|
| 3:24:14| from the constitutional grounds and that had to sue the governor and not the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12254)|
| 3:24:18| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12258)|
| 3:24:19| Governor's order, and we had to do it, we had no choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12259)|
| 3:24:23| So you're correct on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12263)|
| 3:24:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12265)|
| 3:24:26| But if Knox County does A, B, and C, which the governor says, but then also mandates D and E,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12266)|
| 3:24:33| then we are liable for any kind of lawsuit that would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12273)|
| 3:24:39| you know, we're not held harmless at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12279)|
| 3:24:41| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12281)|
| 3:24:42| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12282)|
| 3:24:43| And there's a pending lawsuit right now that we're defending on that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12283)|
| 3:24:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12288)|
| 3:24:48| So moving to an advisory board, which still keeps them in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12288)|
| 3:24:55| but it makes us compliance with all the other counties in Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12295)|
| 3:25:00| potentially could hold us less liable down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12300)|
| 3:25:04| Potentially, but to make it clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12304)|
| 3:25:10| executive order 38 says that the locally run county health departments of the six counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12310)|
| 3:25:17| named can do their own orders independent of what the governor has ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12317)|
| 3:25:23| So we still have that in there, but I follow your reasoning there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12323)|
| 3:25:28| And to some extent, it's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12328)|
| 3:25:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12331)|
| 3:25:32| But and again, all the other counties, the other five counties that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12332)|
| 3:25:36| where the governor said you could do what you wanted to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12336)|
| 3:25:39| they're allowing their director of their health department to make those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12339)|
| 3:25:44| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12344)|
| 3:25:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12345)|
| 3:25:46| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12346)|
| 3:25:47| Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12347)|
| 3:25:49| Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12349)|
| 3:25:51| So correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12351)|
| 3:25:55| We decided in 1996 that we needed a Board of Health, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12355)|
| 3:25:59| That we commissioned, created the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12359)|
| 3:26:04| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12364)|
| 3:26:05| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12365)|
| 3:26:08| So it's not like we just all of a sudden, because of this pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12368)|
| 3:26:12| decided we needed the Board of Health to decide our, you know, how we would proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12372)|
| 3:26:21| We had agreed in 1996 as a legislative body to have this Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12381)|
| 3:26:29| to make public health decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12389)|
| 3:26:31| And in my opinion, and this is coming from the government teacher aspect of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12391)|
| 3:26:36| is that a legislative body would do so to, as a system of checks and balances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12396)|
| 3:26:43| Because if we do leave it up to one person, we are only leaving it up to one person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12403)|
| 3:26:48| We don't necessarily have the perspectives of various members of the medical profession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12408)|
| 3:26:55| We don't necessarily have a citizen representative, which we do now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12415)|
| 3:26:59| We don't have all of the different, well, the county mayor, the city mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12419)|
| 3:27:07| all of the different professionals that make up our current Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12427)|
| 3:27:12| And so, to me, as a citizen, but also as that government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12432)|
| 3:27:16| coming from that government background, that creates a system of checks and balances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12436)|
| 3:27:21| Rather than having one person that is appointed by the county mayor making health decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12441)|
| 3:27:28| who could at any moment, you know, be fired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12448)|
| 3:27:34| I mean, not saying that that would be the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12454)|
| 3:27:37| but that is the reality that could happen depending on who is in power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12457)|
| 3:27:43| So, this does kind of create that system of checks and balances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12463)|
| 3:27:48| from one person having to make the decision to it coming from a group of professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12468)|
| 3:27:55| I'm also leery of our even ability to take away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12475)|
| 3:28:03| powers of the Board of Health and make it advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12483)|
| 3:28:06| I'm not saying we abolish it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12486)|
| 3:28:09| We actually have the power to get rid of the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12489)|
| 3:28:12| But I don't know in reading the code that we actually have the power to just make them advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12492)|
| 3:28:22| And so, these are my concerns with this ordinance as it is written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12502)|
| 3:28:29| CHAIR BAILET Thank you, Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12509)|
| 3:28:32| Commissioner Buehler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12512)|
| 3:28:33| And then I see Commissioner Smith raising his hand as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12513)|
| 3:28:37| COMMISSIONER DURRETT Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12517)|
| 3:28:40| I would say I'm going to trust the law department because I've made it very clear that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12520)|
| 3:28:48| I'm a firm believer that state law supersedes local law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12528)|
| 3:28:52| However, I'm going to trust our law department that they have researched this and by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12532)|
| 3:28:57| the way the ordinance is worded and how we create the health board determines whether or not it has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12537)|
| 3:29:04| the specific powers given to it by TCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12544)|
| 3:29:06| But, you know, I respect all the comments my colleagues have made tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12546)|
| 3:29:11| Everybody makes good points in different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12551)|
| 3:29:14| But I'm going to go back to what Commissioner Ward said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12554)|
| 3:29:18| For me, this has ultimately boiled down to it's a constitutional issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12558)|
| 3:29:23| This is about the constitutionality of the way this is set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12563)|
| 3:29:26| This is not about mask mandates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12566)|
| 3:29:28| This is not about gathering limitations or whatever else, you know, the health board may have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12568)|
| 3:29:36| enacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12576)|
| 3:29:36| This is really about how things are supposed to work in a constitutional republic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12576)|
| 3:29:40| And for the board of health to be an advisory body to the person making these decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12580)|
| 3:29:48| is the way constitutional republics work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12588)|
| 3:29:50| For an unelected body to be the ones who are actually making this policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12590)|
| 3:29:57| as opposed to someone who is part of the mayor's team, the health department director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12597)|
| 3:30:03| the health officer is really an extension of the county government under the county mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12603)|
| 3:30:10| The people at least feel like that they have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12610)|
| 3:30:14| accountability, direct accountability to that person, the way that decision is being made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12614)|
| 3:30:19| You don't see it work that way anywhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12619)|
| 3:30:21| Obviously, in none of the 95 counties, none of the other four counties in Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12621)|
| 3:30:26| have an unelected board that is making these decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12626)|
| 3:30:30| Even at the state level, you don't see the health commission or the state health board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12630)|
| 3:30:34| making policies that supersede the governor's orders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12634)|
| 3:30:38| Because that isn't the way it's supposed to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12638)|
| 3:30:39| Because these are not just health decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12639)|
| 3:30:43| These are decisions that are affecting business, economics, commerce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12643)|
| 3:30:47| people's freedom to live their daily lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12647)|
| 3:30:50| And the people expect those types of decisions to be made by their government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12650)|
| 3:30:58| with advice from health experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12658)|
| 3:31:01| Absolutely and yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12661)|
| 3:31:03| But I think the time has come for these decisions to move to the health department director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12663)|
| 3:31:11| who is an extension of the government and therefore, in a sense, answerable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12671)|
| 3:31:16| to the people for these decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12676)|
| 3:31:19| Two extreme views have crept into this debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12679)|
| 3:31:23| Yes, our community is divided over this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12683)|
| 3:31:25| Our whole country is divided ideologically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12685)|
| 3:31:28| Welcome to the 21st century.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12688)|
| 3:31:30| That's life in America today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12690)|
| 3:31:33| But the two extreme views creep into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12693)|
| 3:31:36| And I'm not talking about the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12696)|
| 3:31:37| There have been some very articulate people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12697)|
| 3:31:40| There have been some very thoughtful people on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12700)|
| 3:31:42| Emails, people that have addressed commission have made great points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12702)|
| 3:31:47| But in the whole debate creeps into two extreme views.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12707)|
| 3:31:52| And one is, man, if we don't do something about the health board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12712)|
| 3:31:55| we're all going to be communists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12715)|
| 3:31:57| And we're not going to be able to go outside our house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12717)|
| 3:31:59| And we're not going to be able to this or that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12719)|
| 3:32:01| That's an extreme view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12721)|
| 3:32:02| I don't think that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12722)|
| 3:32:04| But the other extreme view is, oh, man, if you touch that health board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12724)|
| 3:32:08| we're all going to get COVID and we're all going to die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12728)|
| 3:32:10| Nobody's going to wear a mask anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12730)|
| 3:32:12| Nobody's going to do anything right anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12732)|
| 3:32:14| If you do it, we have to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12734)|
| 3:32:16| That's not true either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12736)|
| 3:32:18| I mean, guys, I respect the people on the board of health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12738)|
| 3:32:20| They are experts in their field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12740)|
| 3:32:23| But they're not your personal physician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12743)|
| 3:32:26| They're not looking out for your individual health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12746)|
| 3:32:29| They're not coming to your house to make sure you're safe from COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12749)|
| 3:32:32| They're just doing a job, an advisory job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12752)|
| 3:32:35| And I would respectfully, you know, in response to my colleagues say, in 1996,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12755)|
| 3:32:41| the health board was created to be an advisory body to the health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12761)|
| 3:32:46| fiscally and in other ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12766)|
| 3:32:48| No one foresaw these kind of powers, even though they may have been written into the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12768)|
| 3:32:53| I don't think anybody foresaw that being part of what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12773)|
| 3:32:56| But I mean, I wasn't on commission in 1996.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12776)|
| 3:32:59| And I don't even remember what the reasons for the ordinance were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12779)|
| 3:33:02| But I don't think it was this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12782)|
| 3:33:04| And so I'll be I will be supporting this, certainly at least on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12784)|
| 3:33:09| Thank you, Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12789)|
| 3:33:11| Commissioner Smith, I saw your hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12791)|
| 3:33:19| Sir, I'll defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12799)|
| 3:33:20| I'm just trying to soak in the wise words of Richie Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12800)|
| 3:33:26| Seeing no other hands, I have some questions I'd like to jump in with real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12806)|
| 3:33:33| First off, I was just looking it up while I was listening to the last comments by Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12813)|
| 3:33:37| Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12817)|
| 3:33:38| The Nashville Metro Health Board is set up exactly like we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12818)|
| 3:33:45| It says, and I quote from their website, the role of the Board of Health is to administer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12825)|
| 3:33:49| and control public health for the metro government of Nashville-Davidson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12829)|
| 3:33:53| They are appointed, and then they are confirmed by their legislative body exactly like ours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12833)|
| 3:33:58| are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12838)|
| 3:33:59| They are the they exercise all the administrative functions of Metro Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12839)|
| 3:34:03| So I'm just reading from that website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12843)|
| 3:34:05| But to say that we're the only ones doing this is seems to be inaccurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12845)|
| 3:34:12| I have a question for our law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12852)|
| 3:34:15| I believe it was October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12855)|
| 3:34:16| It may have been September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12856)|
| 3:34:17| But the last time we had a heavy debate on this, which I think was October, I asked a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12857)|
| 3:34:22| very direct question because this was when Commissioner Hill sort of got to the end of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12862)|
| 3:34:27| this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12867)|
| 3:34:27| And she said, look, the elephant in the room is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12867)|
| 3:34:31| And we had a big discussion, and I asked a very simple question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12871)|
| 3:34:37| Everything that I've read on state law says you can either have one or you cannot have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12877)|
| 3:34:43| one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12883)|
| 3:34:43| And I asked the law director, Mr. Book, I asked you, I said, my understanding is you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12883)|
| 3:34:48| either have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12888)|
| 3:34:50| And if you do, they're governed by how it is set up in state TCA code, or you don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12890)|
| 3:34:55| have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12895)|
| 3:34:56| And you either have one, and you abide by those rules, or you dissolve one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12896)|
| 3:34:59| And the answer was yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12899)|
| 3:35:01| That was the answer I received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12901)|
| 3:35:03| You're either pregnant or you're not pregnant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12903)|
| 3:35:05| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12905)|
| 3:35:06| I mean, one or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12906)|
| 3:35:08| And I read, I went back, and I just sort of walked back through because I have maintained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12908)|
| 3:35:12| from the beginning of this that if you have a state law, that supersedes a local law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12912)|
| 3:35:18| And that is our basic government 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12918)|
| 3:35:22| But if you have a state law, and it says something, then you go by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12922)|
| 3:35:26| And when I read this again, I'm pulled it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12926)|
| 3:35:28| This is TCA 68-601.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12928)|
| 3:35:32| It's really clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12932)|
| 3:35:34| In E, it says, in counties which fail to establish an active board of health, that would not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12934)|
| 3:35:42| be us, pursuant to the subsection A, the commissioner of health may establish a health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12942)|
| 3:35:48| advisory committee to function as provided in 68-802.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12948)|
| 3:35:54| However, the commissioner or commissioner's designated retains all the powers and duties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12954)|
| 3:35:59| of the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12959)|
| 3:36:01| Let me repeat that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12961)|
| 3:36:02| At the beginning, it says, in counties which fail to establish an active board of health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12962)|
| 3:36:06| So, if you have never established an active board of health, or you have dissolved your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12966)|
| 3:36:10| active board of health, then only the commissioner of health may establish the advisory board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12970)|
| 3:36:18| Not county commission, the commissioner of health can establish their own advisory board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12978)|
| 3:36:22| We have decided to have a board of health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12982)|
| 3:36:27| So, as such, the powers, the duties, the structure, the legality of it come from TCA 68-601.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12987)|
| 3:36:36| I think from the very beginning, I've said this is a state law issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=12996)|
| 3:36:40| The state says, if you have this thing, here's how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13000)|
| 3:36:44| If you decide not to have this thing, you can have an advisory board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13004)|
| 3:36:48| You can't do both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13008)|
| 3:36:50| The way it clearly reads in line E, and I asked that question and got the same answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13010)|
| 3:36:55| which was you have it or you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13015)|
| 3:36:57| So, this ordinance, I was, when it came out, I was expecting an ordinance to dissolve the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13017)|
| 3:37:04| Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13024)|
| 3:37:05| But it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13025)|
| 3:37:06| It's an amendment to having one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13026)|
| 3:37:08| And I don't think you can do that according to state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13028)|
| 3:37:11| So, help me understand why we can have it both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13031)|
| 3:37:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13035)|
| 3:37:16| Number one, if you will read the Tile Ward Ordinance, we repeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13036)|
| 3:37:24| We repeal 38-33.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13044)|
| 3:37:28| Boom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13048)|
| 3:37:28| It does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13048)|
| 3:37:29| It's repealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13049)|
| 3:37:30| So, we no longer have the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13050)|
| 3:37:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13053)|
| 3:37:33| So, this is a dissolution of the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13053)|
| 3:37:36| No, it's we repeal that part of 38-33.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13056)|
| 3:37:41| And then we do what Memphis did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13061)|
| 3:37:44| Memphis did that by resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13064)|
| 3:37:46| They didn't want a Board of Health like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13066)|
| 3:37:48| So, they passed a Board of Health resolution in October, which made it clearly only advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13068)|
| 3:37:56| So, what we did was, what this ordinance does is said, okay, we repeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13076)|
| 3:38:02| Do away with that 38-33, but we keep that same board in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13082)|
| 3:38:06| But by our power to make ordinance, we say it is now advisory to the Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13086)|
| 3:38:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13093)|
| 3:38:14| Okay, I'll take this a step at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13094)|
| 3:38:17| Well, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13097)|
| 3:38:20| You're trying to give me some legal advice, and I think you're not reading it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13100)|
| 3:38:25| 68-601 says that if you don't have one, then the commissioner may, in the commissioner's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13105)|
| 3:38:30| discretion, create an advisory board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13110)|
| 3:38:34| That's what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13114)|
| 3:38:35| The commissioner, in the commissioner's discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13115)|
| 3:38:38| Okay, but that's the Commissioner of Health, not the County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13118)|
| 3:38:41| Commissioner of Health may do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13121)|
| 3:38:43| Nothing says that we can't have a board, advisory Board of Health to advise the Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13123)|
| 3:38:50| Department on what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13130)|
| 3:38:52| Nothing prevents that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13132)|
| 3:38:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13133)|
| 3:38:55| Okay, okay, let me just take this piece out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13135)|
| 3:38:57| So, this resolution says we are dissolving the current setup that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13137)|
| 3:39:01| Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13141)|
| 3:39:02| The ordinance we have is dissolving the current.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13142)|
| 3:39:05| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13145)|
| 3:39:06| Is repealing the present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13146)|
| 3:39:08| Dissolving the current setup that we have, and we're establishing a new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13148)|
| 3:39:13| A and B and amending by adding in the sections that you see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13153)|
| 3:39:16| Okay, I'm trying to understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13156)|
| 3:39:20| Not giving you legal advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13160)|
| 3:39:21| I'm trying to understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13161)|
| 3:39:22| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13162)|
| 3:39:23| I'm trying to explain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13163)|
| 3:39:26| A question then for the sponsor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13166)|
| 3:39:28| You have another resolution earlier in the year to create a newly formed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13168)|
| 3:39:34| Advisory Board of Health and Economic Wellbeing to advise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13174)|
| 3:39:38| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13178)|
| 3:39:40| Based on everything I just heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13180)|
| 3:39:42| Your proposal is to now have another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13182)|
| 3:39:44| So you have two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13184)|
| 3:39:46| You have two parallel advisory boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13186)|
| 3:39:49| Two separate things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13189)|
| 3:39:50| The other one advises the mayor, not the county health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13190)|
| 3:39:55| And.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13195)|
| 3:39:56| This one, it does the mayor and the commission, and this one just does the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13196)|
| 3:40:00| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13200)|
| 3:40:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13201)|
| 3:40:04| Other hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13204)|
| 3:40:05| I see any other hands I see up right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13205)|
| 3:40:08| Could I also weigh in, Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13208)|
| 3:40:13| Just to clarify for the rest of the board on the law and the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13213)|
| 3:40:18| We absolutely have the right to repeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13218)|
| 3:40:20| And I think that Commissioner Dura talked about the 1996 when we established the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13220)|
| 3:40:28| Until October, or I'm sorry, until March or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13228)|
| 3:40:34| The Board of Health, according to Dr. Buchanan, had met only quarterly for one purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13234)|
| 3:40:40| And that was to do with statutory duty to advise on a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13240)|
| 3:40:45| So they'd never made policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13245)|
| 3:40:46| They never made any health policy for the health department from 1996 until February or March of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13246)|
| 3:40:56| Then we talk about the experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13256)|
| 3:40:57| I would submit that from what I've been over there in Dr. Buchanan's office and talked with her and her people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13257)|
| 3:41:04| She has experts in epidemiology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13264)|
| 3:41:07| She has all sorts of experts there to advise her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13267)|
| 3:41:11| With all due respect to the Board of Health, there are doctors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13271)|
| 3:41:14| There's a dentist and a veterinarian and general practitioner and a surgeon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13274)|
| 3:41:19| And they're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13279)|
| 3:41:20| There's nothing wrong with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13280)|
| 3:41:22| But they're not epidemiologists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13282)|
| 3:41:23| They're not virologists like Dr. Buchanan has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13283)|
| 3:41:26| So I think to say that relying on the Board of Health for expertise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13286)|
| 3:41:32| when Dr. Buchanan has that on her staff, is not the proper way to look at exactly what this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13292)|
| 3:41:43| Just wanted to make that clear that that's what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13303)|
| 3:41:45| And the Board of Health never made policy since 1996 until recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13305)|
| 3:41:54| Commissioner Lundy and Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13314)|
| 3:41:57| Commissioner Lundy first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13317)|
| 3:42:00| I just have one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13320)|
| 3:42:01| So if the House passes the Board of Health bill, I guess if it goes to the House and Senate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13321)|
| 3:42:13| what I'm reading is that the county mayor will make decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13333)|
| 3:42:18| So that does that dissolve this ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13338)|
| 3:42:22| I've lost you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13342)|
| 3:42:23| I don't think that executive order says that the mayor shall make the decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13343)|
| 3:42:28| She's talking about the House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13348)|
| 3:42:33| Well, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13353)|
| 3:42:34| I haven't read that bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13354)|
| 3:42:35| I don't know what the House is going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13355)|
| 3:42:37| That's up to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13357)|
| 3:42:38| I haven't read that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13358)|
| 3:42:40| I don't know what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13360)|
| 3:42:43| I haven't seen that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13363)|
| 3:42:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13365)|
| 3:42:46| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13366)|
| 3:42:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13369)|
| 3:42:51| Now, Mr. Mayor, are you still there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13371)|
| 3:42:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13377)|
| 3:42:58| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13378)|
| 3:42:59| I'm going to divulge one of our conversations about the health board, if that's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13379)|
| 3:43:06| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13386)|
| 3:43:07| When these questions come up, the mayor can fire Dr. B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13387)|
| 3:43:13| It's not that simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13393)|
| 3:43:15| I don't think the mayor has any intentions whatsoever in discussions with Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13395)|
| 3:43:21| He's not going to fire Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13401)|
| 3:43:23| She's awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13403)|
| 3:43:24| She's great at what she does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13404)|
| 3:43:26| That would be, I guess, the word asinine comes to mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13406)|
| 3:43:32| And hopefully, Mayor, I'm not putting you on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13412)|
| 3:43:35| I just wanted to let you know, let the people know that you and I have had some conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13415)|
| 3:43:42| Go ahead, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13422)|
| 3:43:44| I said I appreciate that, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13424)|
| 3:43:49| Mr. Law Director, I've told people, you can correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13429)|
| 3:43:54| I've told my citizens that Dr. Buchanan can only be fired for malfeasance, criminal actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13434)|
| 3:44:01| She just can't be fired right off the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13441)|
| 3:44:04| I don't like Dr. Buchanan, so I'm going to go fire her, Ken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13444)|
| 3:44:07| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13447)|
| 3:44:08| The statute says that the Director of Health shall be appointed by the commissioner in Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13448)|
| 3:44:19| with the concurrence of the mayor of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13459)|
| 3:44:21| So it's not that simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13461)|
| 3:44:23| The law director is appointed by the commissioner and has to meet the commissioner's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13463)|
| 3:44:28| standards before the commissioner even gives the okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13468)|
| 3:44:35| And then it's done in cooperation with the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13475)|
| 3:44:38| So it's not that simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13478)|
| 3:44:40| And he's not going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13480)|
| 3:44:41| I've heard him say too many times, with all due respect, Mayor, you're on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13481)|
| 3:44:45| How much he respects, as do I, Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13485)|
| 3:44:48| I want to say again that if this passes this month and next month, Dr. Buchanan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13488)|
| 3:44:59| no matter what the news media says, Dr. Buchanan will have 100 percent control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13499)|
| 3:45:05| of making any type of mandates, close the businesses down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13505)|
| 3:45:08| That is Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13508)|
| 3:45:10| That will be Dr. Buchanan's decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13510)|
| 3:45:13| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13513)|
| 3:45:14| And again, I do not believe in my heart of hearts that Mayor Jacobs has no intentions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13514)|
| 3:45:23| of trying to let Dr. Buchanan go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13523)|
| 3:45:25| I did not want to make this decision tonight until the spring or summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13525)|
| 3:45:31| But this board has gone too far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13531)|
| 3:45:32| So, number one, Dr. Buchanan, you're awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13532)|
| 3:45:36| You're not, I don't think you're going to be fired at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13536)|
| 3:45:40| I wouldn't want your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13540)|
| 3:45:41| And number two is that let's all do the golden rule and we'll get along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13541)|
| 3:45:52| And we're going to make it through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13552)|
| 3:45:54| And hopefully in 10 years from now, we're going to look back and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13554)|
| 3:45:58| y'all remember the year 2020?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13558)|
| 3:46:00| And we're going to say, no, we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13560)|
| 3:46:04| Commissioner Hill, excuse me, Commissioner Smith and then Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13564)|
| 3:46:08| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13568)|
| 3:46:12| I'll defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13572)|
| 3:46:13| I just wanted to make sure you had Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13573)|
| 3:46:16| I've seen her trying to raise her hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13576)|
| 3:46:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13577)|
| 3:46:18| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13578)|
| 3:46:19| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13579)|
| 3:46:25| I so appreciate what everyone has said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13585)|
| 3:46:30| Commissioner Beeler, sometimes you continue to just amaze me with your eloquence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13590)|
| 3:46:36| and things that you say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13596)|
| 3:46:37| Commissioner Durant, your point is certainly well taken about distribution of powers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13597)|
| 3:46:46| and who, in fact, can make decisions about any given topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13606)|
| 3:46:54| I still think that this elephant is still sitting in this room because when we really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13614)|
| 3:47:02| because when we really look at what the people are upset about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13622)|
| 3:47:14| a huge part of it, at least the emails that I've gotten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13634)|
| 3:47:18| have to do with the regulations that have been placed on the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13638)|
| 3:47:25| Commissioner Ward, you have advocated tirelessly for businesses, especially small businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13645)|
| 3:47:36| I'm not real sure that if we have one person making the decision that boards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13656)|
| 3:47:44| I mean, that businesses have to close early or businesses can have so many people in at one time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13664)|
| 3:47:52| that people that feel the way they do, they're not going to like that any better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13672)|
| 3:48:02| coming from one person than they are from an entire board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13682)|
| 3:48:09| The end result is still the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13689)|
| 3:48:13| So that's very concerning to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13693)|
| 3:48:17| I, to my knowledge, I believe this is a correct statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13697)|
| 3:48:25| Dr. Buchanan has voted with and supported every decision so far that the Board of Health has made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13705)|
| 3:48:38| So to think that taking the power away from an unelected board and giving the power to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13718)|
| 3:48:49| one person who is also unelected is going to fix this, I genuinely believe, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13729)|
| 3:49:00| not only is it not going to fix it, but it is going to cause, in my opinion, even deeper divides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13740)|
| 3:49:15| as people are so polarized on one side or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13755)|
| 3:49:20| That's very, very concerning to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13760)|
| 3:49:24| I mean, right now, there's a whole lot of people not happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13764)|
| 3:49:29| No matter which way this decision goes, in the end, there's still going to be a whole lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13769)|
| 3:49:37| that are not happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13777)|
| 3:49:40| So I just caution all of us, and I'm talking to myself too, that as we think through this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13780)|
| 3:49:50| and think about making such a huge change, which I think I said early on, in the middle of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13790)|
| 3:50:00| this crisis that we are still sitting in, and in fact, in some ways, taking even more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13800)|
| 3:50:09| power away from the people, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13809)|
| 3:50:14| I mean, at least, I feel like now, and again, I don't know where I'm coming down on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13814)|
| 3:50:21| I'm just kind of really talking out loud, but right now, our existing Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13821)|
| 3:50:28| not only has medical people on it, but it actually does have a school superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13828)|
| 3:50:33| It actually does have a county mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13833)|
| 3:50:35| In many ways, it's much more representative of the people than a single person would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13835)|
| 3:50:47| And I don't think that anyone on this commission would insinuate for a minute, I wouldn't think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13847)|
| 3:50:55| that our Board of Health has not acted in what they felt like was the best interest of public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13855)|
| 3:51:03| health, which is the same thing that certainly Dr. Buchanan would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13863)|
| 3:51:10| So, I just really want to caution people as we move forward with this to think about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13870)|
| 3:51:20| ramifications and also to ask yourselves, is this really going to fix really the biggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13880)|
| 3:51:31| issues that we're dealing with, which, I mean, people can talk about it's masked or not masked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13891)|
| 3:51:37| but truly, I think for the most part, these five core actions, most of us can live with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13897)|
| 3:51:46| You might not like it, but you can live with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13906)|
| 3:51:48| But is it going to really fix these additional restrictions that have been put on our economy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13908)|
| 3:51:56| been put on people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13916)|
| 3:52:03| Because if Dr. Buchanan makes that same decision, I don't think it's going to be accepted any better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13923)|
| 3:52:10| coming out of her than it will be out of the Board of Health by the same group of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13930)|
| 3:52:17| that are already unhappy about it all to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13937)|
| 3:52:21| So, that's just my heart in this manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13941)|
| 3:52:27| I appreciate the forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13947)|
| 3:52:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13950)|
| 3:52:31| Thank you, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13951)|
| 3:52:32| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13952)|
| 3:52:34| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13954)|
| 3:52:35| So, I kind of understand what you're saying, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13955)|
| 3:52:38| But at the same time, I don't think any of us can predict what Dr. Buchanan is going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13958)|
| 3:52:44| say or do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13964)|
| 3:52:45| But I do know this, whenever we do this, it's going to open up an avenue for her to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13965)|
| 3:52:51| to talk to the members of the Board of Health and not have to worry about violating specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13971)|
| 3:52:56| things or laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13976)|
| 3:52:57| She's going to be able to open herself up to them to be able to speak to them throughout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13977)|
| 3:53:01| specific times and not have to have an open meeting and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13981)|
| 3:53:07| This virus is changing rapidly, sometimes increasing, sometimes decreasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13987)|
| 3:53:11| Sometimes we talk about the vaccine coming out and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13991)|
| 3:53:15| But if you've paid attention over the past few months, which I feel like everybody on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=13995)|
| 3:53:20| the County Commission has, what we've seen is different aspects being talked about and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14000)|
| 3:53:24| talked around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14004)|
| 3:53:26| We've talked about the levels of anxiety, depression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14006)|
| 3:53:30| We've talked about suicide rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14010)|
| 3:53:32| We've talked about homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14012)|
| 3:53:33| We've talked about small businesses and how this is affecting us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14013)|
| 3:53:36| So, we got together a committee that can talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14016)|
| 3:53:40| And we're saying they're going to help point the mayor in a specific direction whenever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14020)|
| 3:53:45| this thing is hopefully over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14025)|
| 3:53:47| We're going to use it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14027)|
| 3:53:48| We're going to use it later and for years to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14028)|
| 3:53:50| So, now what we're talking about tonight and voting on is the opportunity to have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14030)|
| 3:53:58| lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14038)|
| 3:53:59| I mean, Chairman Jay spoke, it was a couple months ago, and talked about a totally different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14039)|
| 3:54:04| committee that we were never taking advantage of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14044)|
| 3:54:07| One of the things that I admire about him was he was talking about the opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14047)|
| 3:54:11| that we haven't been taking to talk to these different leaders on these committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14051)|
| 3:54:16| And to my knowledge, there's still some of those committees that haven't been used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14056)|
| 3:54:20| It's going to be amazing for us to be able to bring them all together without violating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14060)|
| 3:54:26| any sunshine or anything like that and have them take the opportunity to speak with Dr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14066)|
| 3:54:32| Buchanan to help lead guide and direct us in the right path, the right way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14072)|
| 3:54:36| And I, for one, am voting for this because I look forward to the aspect of we might find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14076)|
| 3:54:42| a new direction through this that we haven't been able to do in the past because we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14082)|
| 3:54:46| kind of been throttled back because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14086)|
| 3:54:50| I think that the direction now is more important than ever, given the Board of Health is, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14090)|
| 3:54:57| see the direction they want to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14097)|
| 3:54:58| They say, no, we're not going to focus on, you know, crippling our small businesses and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14098)|
| 3:55:03| things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14103)|
| 3:55:04| But then we turn right around today, like Commissioner Daley was just talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14104)|
| 3:55:10| and we see where they're talking about wanting to re-implement the closing of restaurants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14110)|
| 3:55:15| gyms, et cetera, from Executive Order Number 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14115)|
| 3:55:18| We see where they are wanting to go outside of county limits and they're wanting to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14118)|
| 3:55:21| to surrounding counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14121)|
| 3:55:22| Can you imagine the lawsuits we're going to get from these surrounding counties if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14122)|
| 3:55:25| do try to do something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14125)|
| 3:55:27| I mean, we'd probably have to raise taxes to be able to fight everything off with our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14127)|
| 3:55:30| legal bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14130)|
| 3:55:32| So where I'm coming to this is I think that this is an opportunity for us to come together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14132)|
| 3:55:38| as a county commission and point it in the right direction and give Dr. B all the resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14138)|
| 3:55:44| she deserves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14144)|
| 3:55:45| If she wants to talk to the people on the Board of Health after this is dissolved, she| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14145)|
| 3:55:49| can have a daily conference with them like she used to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14149)|
| 3:55:52| And we can just kind of go on and put our best foot forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14152)|
| 3:55:55| And like Commissioner Bussler stated, there's going to be vaccines coming out and hopefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14155)|
| 3:56:00| this curve will be flattened and we can see some light at the end of the tunnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14160)|
| 3:56:04| So that's why I'm voting yes on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14164)|
| 3:56:06| And I feel like I really want to echo Director Buch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14166)|
| 3:56:11| You and I went over to Dr. Buchanan's office a couple months ago together and had a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14171)|
| 3:56:16| long sit-down talk with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14176)|
| 3:56:18| She's got an amazing staff over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14178)|
| 3:56:21| And I want to thank you, Director Buch, and I want to thank Dr. Buchanan for all of your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14181)|
| 3:56:25| efforts you've put through in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14185)|
| 3:56:27| And I really look forward to the direction that we're going to be going as a team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14187)|
| 3:56:30| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14190)|
| 3:56:32| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14192)|
| 3:56:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14195)|
| 3:56:37| There was a mention of the state legislation that's, and I just kind of wanted to give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14197)|
| 3:56:45| you a quick update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14205)|
| 3:56:46| Representative Jason Zachary has filed House Bill 0007, and it now has a Senate sponsor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14206)|
| 3:56:58| which is Senator Mike Bell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14218)|
| 3:57:01| And that Senate bill is number 0015, if anybody wants to review those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14221)|
| 3:57:09| Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14229)|
| 3:57:11| Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14231)|
| 3:57:19| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14239)|
| 3:57:20| So, I was just reviewing our charter, Section 1, Chapter 38, Article 2, Sections 38 through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14240)|
| 3:57:30| 33 that is listed in this ordinance that says, County Board of Health is hereby amended by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14250)|
| 3:57:37| repealing subsections A and B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14257)|
| 3:57:39| And subsections A and B state are actually the ones that give us, there is here, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14259)|
| 3:57:48| Section A, Section 38-33A, there is hereby created a County Board of Health that shall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14268)|
| 3:57:56| have all the powers and duties as required and provided for by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14276)|
| 3:58:01| Part B, the director of the Department of Health shall report to and work in concert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14281)|
| 3:58:05| with the County Board of Health, in addition to reporting to and working with the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14285)|
| 3:58:09| executive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14289)|
| 3:58:10| Now, if I'm understanding this ordinance correctly, where it says it is hereby amended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14290)|
| 3:58:16| by repealing subsections A and B in their entirety and amending to read as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14296)|
| 3:58:22| So, just as a point of clarification, that means we are getting rid of the Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14302)|
| 3:58:29| as it is written in the state code to, with giving them the power to create mandates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14309)|
| 3:58:38| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14318)|
| 3:58:43| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14323)|
| 3:58:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14324)|
| 3:58:46| So, basically, we're doing away with the code, the state code created by elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14326)|
| 3:58:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14336)|
| 3:58:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14339)|
| 3:59:00| Well, that, so therein lies my confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14340)|
| 3:59:04| Can you clarify that for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14344)|
| 3:59:07| The establishment of a Board of Health is totally discretionary by the 92 counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14347)|
| 3:59:17| Several of them have established it, like us, and I think Hamilton County has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14357)|
| 3:59:22| but they don't establish policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14362)|
| 3:59:26| So, no, we have the total authority to either adopt that Board of Health as set out in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14366)|
| 3:59:34| statute in those two sections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14374)|
| 3:59:36| We have the same power to get rid of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14376)|
| 3:59:39| We have the same power to repeal it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14379)|
| 3:59:42| Right. So, I just want to make sure that I'm understanding that this ordinance is getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14382)|
| 3:59:46| rid of the Board of Health and creating, therefore, an advisory Board of Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14386)|
| 3:59:49| but it just happens to include the same people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14389)|
| 3:59:52| The same as the Shelby County did, exactly the same as Shelby County did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14392)|
| 3:59:58| And is what, Shelby County did what I just said, where they got rid of the Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14398)|
| 4:00:07| that existed and created just an advisory board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14407)|
| 4:00:13| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14413)|
| 4:00:13| That just happened to be made up of the same people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14413)|
| 4:00:16| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14416)|
| 4:00:18| Their resolution reads the composition, reads exactly the way the composition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14418)|
| 4:00:24| or substantially the same as the composition as set out in the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14424)|
| 4:00:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14431)|
| 4:00:34| We're not alone in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14434)|
| 4:00:39| Commissioner Durrett, did you have additional questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14439)|
| 4:00:43| I don't have any other questions now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14443)|
| 4:00:45| Commissioner Lundy, I see your light on again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14445)|
| 4:00:49| I guess I want to piggyback on Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14449)|
| 4:00:52| Are you saying the same people as far as the same people as in other counties are the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14452)|
| 4:00:58| people that we have now? Because if you're saying the same people we have now is excluding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14458)|
| 4:01:04| the city mayor on this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14464)|
| 4:01:06| That's correct. That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14466)|
| 4:01:10| Well, what I'm talking about with Shelby County was the statute outlines the various| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14470)|
| 4:01:23| entities like the local medical society will reference one, the local dental society,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14483)|
| 4:01:30| the local veterinary society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14490)|
| 4:01:32| And that's what they adopted the way it was in the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14492)|
| 4:01:35| What this ordinance does, and this was very important to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14495)|
| 4:01:40| Commissioner Ward is that you kept those same people in there because they're hardworking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14500)|
| 4:01:45| people. They have good opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14505)|
| 4:01:47| And he wanted to keep that in there as an advisory thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14507)|
| 4:01:51| So, yeah, including the city mayor will be on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14511)|
| 4:01:58| I have a quick question about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14518)|
| 4:02:01| Would you have to, if this was dissolved, or excuse me, repealed, and this new entity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14521)|
| 4:02:08| that even if it was the exact same was reconstituted, would you then have to start over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14528)|
| 4:02:16| As soon as you, if this were to pass, as soon as you do that, the current, everybody that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14536)|
| 4:02:21| on the current Board of Health disappears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14541)|
| 4:02:24| Would you have to reconstitute, reappoint, reestablish, reconfirm by commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14544)|
| 4:02:31| and start the whole press over to get, even if you got the same people, would you go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14551)|
| 4:02:35| the same governmental process in which to appoint people to this new board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14555)|
| 4:02:40| Well, because if you pass this ordinance, within the ordinance, it says that the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14560)|
| 4:02:46| people that are on the Board of Health are going to be on this advisory Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14566)|
| 4:02:51| So, you've accomplished all of that without having to go through a bunch of steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14571)|
| 4:02:56| And that was very important to Commissioner Ward when he was, he and I were discussing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14576)|
| 4:03:03| He didn't want to go through all of that, what you suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14583)|
| 4:03:06| And I don't think you have to, because this ordinance takes care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14586)|
| 4:03:10| And can I try that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14590)|
| 4:03:14| If the current Board of Health, if this were to pass, and the current Board of Health said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14594)|
| 4:03:18| no, thanks, I don't want to be on your new Board of Health, you would have to start all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14598)|
| 4:03:23| If somebody said they didn't want to do it, then you would fill that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14603)|
| 4:03:27| position like you normally would. I mean, that's all there would be to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14607)|
| 4:03:32| I saw Dr. Buchanan pop in with her hand up. Did you wish to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14612)|
| 4:03:37| Yeah. So, I'm a little bit confused because I heard the city mayor, and the city mayor is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14617)|
| 4:03:41| part of the current construct of the Board of Health based on TCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14621)|
| 4:03:48| Thank you, Dr. Buchanan. That was the point I was going to try to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14628)|
| 4:03:53| It is. Nothing to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14633)|
| 4:04:00| I also don't see it in the ordinance. Anything about the city mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14640)|
| 4:04:03| What I said, I was going by what somebody said. What would that mean that the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14643)|
| 4:04:08| I assumed without looking back at it, because of a comment that somebody made, does that mean that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14648)|
| 4:04:14| the city mayor would remain on the Board? So, I assumed that the city mayor was on the Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14654)|
| 4:04:20| That's why I answered it that way. I didn't mean to. I just didn't research it. So, I misspoke on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14660)|
| 4:04:27| that. But that was the basis on which I made that comment. Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14667)|
| 4:04:35| Well, I just wanted to clarify that. Thank you, Dr. Buchanan. I hope you're doing well, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14675)|
| 4:04:44| We've talked and talked and talked about this, and I want to address a couple of points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14684)|
| 4:04:49| I need to let my finger move here. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14689)|
| 4:04:57| I'll mute down here so that I can use my hands to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14697)|
| 4:05:03| To Commissioner Hill's point, yes, this does not solve the problem that some people have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14703)|
| 4:05:11| We are limited by the state to which direction we can go and how we can resolve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14711)|
| 4:05:19| You know, I came in here tonight really trying to do something I normally don't do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14719)|
| 4:05:25| and that was try to find the political middle ground, to try to make as many people happy as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14725)|
| 4:05:30| I possibly could. And my initial thought was pass it on first reading, postpone it 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14730)|
| 4:05:39| That way people see that we're trying to do something. And I'd also seen, quite honestly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14739)|
| 4:05:45| from the Board of Health, the last couple of meetings, a lot of things that I felt very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14745)|
| 4:05:50| positive about. Dr. Hart, I believe her name is, the lady that's the professor at UT Nursing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14750)|
| 4:05:58| when she talked about respect for people who can't or choose not to wear a mask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14758)|
| 4:06:03| I thought that's great. Dr. Brown, who was a guest speaker from Covenant, I'm going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14763)|
| 4:06:09| paraphrase him, but the simplicity of this is, are those five core actions can do more good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14769)|
| 4:06:17| than any kind of mandate. You know, we've reached a point where we all need to try to come together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14777)|
| 4:06:23| to do what's best for people. We all have to make some compromises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14783)|
| 4:06:30| But then I look at, as Commissioner Daley said, at the Board of Health's agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14790)|
| 4:06:37| and they're wanting the governor to reinstate Order 17, which takes us back to March| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14797)|
| 4:06:45| 17th or 22nd, with basically everything closed down. In addition to that, they want the governor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14805)|
| 4:06:54| to do an executive order, giving them power, not over just the county in which they have power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14814)|
| 4:07:00| currently, but the surrounding counties. And to me, I've reached a point that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14820)|
| 4:07:08| have to do what we were elected to do, and being the only body that has any control over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14828)|
| 4:07:14| the Board of Health, I think our next step is to pass this on first reading. That's all I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14834)|
| 4:07:20| guys. CHAIR BAILET Thank you, Commissioner Smith. Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14840)|
| 4:07:25| Bussler and then Daley. And at that point, I believe most everybody's spoken twice. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14845)|
| 4:07:30| we'll kind of head towards final comments. The motion is to move forward to next week. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14850)|
| 4:07:35| there's not a vote to approve or deny this week. Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14855)|
| 4:07:40| COMMISSIONER BUSSLER I was going to just make the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14860)|
| 4:07:43| that we call for the question, but I'll let Commissioner Daley speak. That's what I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14863)|
| 4:07:48| going to call. CHAIR BAILET No. Is there any other? If we do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14868)|
| 4:07:54| we're going to vote on that as a roll call and then go back to where we are. But I'm not seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14874)|
| 4:07:57| other comments. So, if it's okay, I sort of will look at everybody and everybody seems like we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14877)|
| 4:08:03| done commenting for the night. So, if it's okay with you, I'll move to the vote instead of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14883)|
| 4:08:08| call to the vote and then the vote again, if that's okay. So, the motion on the floor was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14888)|
| 4:08:16| first by Commissioner Ward and a second by Commissioner Beeler is to move forward to next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14896)|
| 4:08:19| week without recommendation and continue the discussion and bring this up at our commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-201214?start=14899)|
