| 0:02:18| Good evening, council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=138)|
| 0:02:20| It's a pleasure to be here before you this evening to address this important topic that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=140)|
| 0:02:24| we've been working on and you all have been supporting and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=144)|
| 0:02:28| the whole community cares a lot about this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=148)|
| 0:02:30| So as you all know, Knoxville is vibrant and growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=150)|
| 0:02:34| We are fortunate to live in a city that people want to move to, that has a bright and promising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=154)|
| 0:02:38| future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=158)|
| 0:02:39| However, growth can be positive but it also presents some challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=159)|
| 0:02:44| So as you agree, I want to welcome our newcoming people to Knoxville while also at the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=164)|
| 0:02:51| time making sure our current Knoxville residents don't get squeezed out of their homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=171)|
| 0:02:56| So how do we do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=176)|
| 0:02:57| Well, first, we recognize that the housing crisis is real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=177)|
| 0:03:01| You will hear tonight that we need to build between 1,200 and 1,600 new homes per year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=181)|
| 0:03:07| just to keep up with the projected growth in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=187)|
| 0:03:11| So simply put, we must do more to make sure Knoxville is attainable and affordable for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=191)|
| 0:03:17| And that's really important, not just for some people at a certain income level, but for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=197)|
| 0:03:21| everybody at all income levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=201)|
| 0:03:23| And you are well aware of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=203)|
| 0:03:25| In 2021, with the support of this council, we launched the Affordable Housing Fund, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=205)|
| 0:03:30| committed via ordinance a minimum of $5 million a year for 10 years towards affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=210)|
| 0:03:36| And as you all know, I'm very pleased that while $5 million was a good floor, we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=216)|
| 0:03:43| exceeded that goal every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=223)|
| 0:03:45| And in my four years and counting as mayor, we have invested more than $40 million towards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=225)|
| 0:03:51| affordable housing in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=231)|
| 0:03:53| So that is really positive and much more than the floor that we committed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=233)|
| 0:03:58| The other good news is that $40 million has leveraged over $600 million in private investments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=238)|
| 0:04:04| resulting in the creation of thousands of new homes, including 2,300 affordable homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=244)|
| 0:04:10| So we have made substantial progress, but more is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=250)|
| 0:04:13| And tonight, we're going to walk you through an update of our strategic plan and talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=253)|
| 0:04:18| innovative solutions we are working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=258)|
| 0:04:21| You will hear about our housing ecosystem, our vision, our priorities, and how we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=261)|
| 0:04:25| using data to support and inform our strategic decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=265)|
| 0:04:29| So let me be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=269)|
| 0:04:30| We are addressing the housing crisis, and we will continue to use every available lever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=270)|
| 0:04:36| to make housing attainable for everyone in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=276)|
| 0:04:39| So now, Vice Mayor, I'm going to conclude my remarks and then invite, when you're ready,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=279)|
| 0:04:45| Kevin DuBose, our Director of Housing and Neighbor Development, is going to lead council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=285)|
| 0:04:49| off on this important presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=289)|
| 0:04:51| I appreciate your time and attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=291)|
| 0:04:53| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=293)|
| 0:04:55| Over to you, Director DuBose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=295)|
| 0:04:57| Thank you, Vice Mayor Smith and council, for the opportunity to talk to you about what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=297)|
| 0:05:05| we're doing to address the housing need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=305)|
| 0:05:08| Before I get started, I'd like to recognize all of the members on my team, the Housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=308)|
| 0:05:15| and Neighborhood Development Department, if you would just wave your hands so council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=315)|
| 0:05:20| knows who you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=320)|
| 0:05:22| I'd like to, secondly, really just describe the challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=322)|
| 0:05:29| You know, when we first started looking at the housing strategy, what's been done, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=329)|
| 0:05:35| we need to do moving forward, I strictly saw it as an affordable housing issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=335)|
| 0:05:44| And I've since learned that there are two groups that we really need to be concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=344)|
| 0:05:51| about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=351)|
| 0:05:54| One, traditionally dependent on subsidized housing, and another group that are the working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=354)|
| 0:06:07| poor, almost, I hate to use that word, but working but unable to earn enough to keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=367)|
| 0:06:14| up with the rising rents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=374)|
| 0:06:17| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=377)|
| 0:06:19| Affordable housing has a connotation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=379)|
| 0:06:22| It traditionally means housing for those earning 60% of the AMI and below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=382)|
| 0:06:30| Workforce housing is that term that usually describes those earning between 60% and 100%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=390)|
| 0:06:40| of the AMI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=400)|
| 0:06:41| And attainable housing is sort of the new language that we're using to describe the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=401)|
| 0:06:50| needs of both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=410)|
| 0:06:52| Okay, next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=412)|
| 0:06:55| Why attainable housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-240215?start=415)|
