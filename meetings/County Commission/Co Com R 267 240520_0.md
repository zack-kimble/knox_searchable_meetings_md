| 0:01:38| All right, seeing none, we'll move forward with our devotional. The floor is Commissioner Lundy's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=98)|
| 0:01:44| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=104)|
| 0:01:46| Lately, I have been seeing a lot of people on hospice care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=106)|
| 0:01:51| I don't know if anybody know, but my doctor agrees in physical therapy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=111)|
| 0:01:55| So I've been a physical therapist for almost 19 years and in probably the past seven years I've been into the hospice realm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=115)|
| 0:02:03| But lately they have been calling therapy. And so I'm probably have at least four patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=123)|
| 0:02:10| And it's been very, I can say weary, but very eye opening when you talk to people who are they know their days are numbered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=130)|
| 0:02:20| A lot of them are bed bound and just kind of process in life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=140)|
| 0:02:26| And I have had opportunities to have deep discussions with them of, you know, how would they live their life differently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=146)|
| 0:02:32| What what do they want to do, especially as the other end is coming?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=152)|
| 0:02:39| And it made me reflect on writing something called the inner battle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=159)|
| 0:02:45| It's easy to become consumed by the external conflicts that we see in our world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=165)|
| 0:02:51| The wars, the strife, the division, all these demand our attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=171)|
| 0:02:57| Let us not forget the most profound and crucial battle we face is within the very depths of our souls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=177)|
| 0:03:05| The inner struggle is one that caused us to align with the divine power of God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=185)|
| 0:03:11| And doing so, we align our hearts with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=191)|
| 0:03:14| It's eternal truth of our creator, which is rooted in love, mercy and justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=194)|
| 0:03:21| As we continue to walk this path called life, we must remember not to be consumed by fear, anger and anxiety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=201)|
| 0:03:31| The scripture reminds us in Philippians four verses six through seven to bring all our anxieties to God in prayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=211)|
| 0:03:40| There lies our peace, a peace that transcends all understanding and guards our hearts in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=220)|
| 0:03:48| Our actions, the visible manifestations of this inner war must reflect the fruits of the spirit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=228)|
| 0:03:54| Love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=234)|
| 0:04:04| These are the hallmarks of a victorious life, a life that stands as a testament of the transformative power of God's love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=244)|
| 0:04:13| Let us focus on this inner battle. Let us utilize the divine weapons of prayer, faith and love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=253)|
| 0:04:20| By doing so, we not only find victory within ourselves, but also become beacons of hope in light in a world that so desperately need a both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=260)|
| 0:04:32| If we can bow our heads for prayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=272)|
| 0:04:35| God, I thank you for moments like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=275)|

| 0:04:59| Let us become a people that's on one accord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=299)|

| 0:05:08| Whatever battles that we are facing, we know that your love will transform it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=308)|
| 0:05:15| Continue to lead us and guide us and forgive us when we fall short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=315)|
| 0:05:21| We are so grateful for your wisdom, your knowledge and your understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=321)|
| 0:05:25| And most of all, your love. In Jesus name, I pray. Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=325)|
| 0:05:29| Amen. Thank you, Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=329)|
| 0:05:32| And now for our pledge and Commissioner Frazier, please rise if you're able with a proper salute to our flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=332)|
| 0:05:40| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=340)|
| 0:05:48| one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=348)|

| 0:07:20| Thank you, Madam Chair. Due to the interest from the public with some phone calls and emails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=440)|
| 0:07:25| could we on items number 56 and 57, could we have the clerk's office conduct a roll call vote on those two items, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=445)|
| 0:07:36| Do commissioners have any objections with roll call on item 56 or 57?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=456)|

| 0:11:56| Oh, even though it was approved last week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=716)|
| 0:11:58| Yeah, because it would be on consent if we didn't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=718)|
| 0:12:00| So, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=720)|

| 0:27:44| it means a lot to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=1664)|
| 0:27:45| It means that my neighbors are going to get quality medical care from people that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=1665)|
| 0:27:50| know and they care about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=1670)|

| 0:28:02| They initially evaluate the patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| They provide that initial intervention that can sometimes be the difference of them making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=1684)|

| 0:28:30| My dad was a fireman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=1710)|

| 0:28:39| There are hands and feet out in the community, and we couldn't do our job without them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=1719)|

| 0:28:48| because they're out on the roads, out in communities, going into people's homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=1728)|

| 0:29:03| got each other's back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=1743)|

| 0:29:08| best in the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| And that's what makes it easier because I know that I've got help on either side of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=1750)|
| 0:29:13| me whenever I go to step up to any call I go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=1753)|
| 0:29:17| It's rewarding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=1757)|

| 0:29:32| rewarding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=1772)|
| 0:29:33| I just love helping people, and it's kind of what God led me to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=1773)|

| 0:30:11| I felt like I was called to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=1811)|
| 0:30:13| But most importantly, most of it is just, we all come together for a common goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=1813)|
| 0:30:18| It don't matter what uniform we wear, what we do, what department we go to, our common| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=1818)|

| 0:33:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2017)|
| 0:33:44| It doesn't like being put on the spot here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2024)|
| 0:34:02| We really appreciate Commission and Mayor Jacobs for recognizing individuals every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2042)|
| 0:34:07| that are out there putting their lives on the line, to include firefighters, EMS professionals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2047)|
| 0:34:13| rescue personnel, law enforcement folks, 30 years in the business, and the atmosphere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2053)|
| 0:34:20| and environment certainly isn't getting any easier for these folks to do their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2060)|
| 0:34:25| So we really appreciate recognition when it's offered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2065)|
| 0:34:29| We don't get it very often, but that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2069)|
| 0:34:32| None of these folks did this for the money or for the praise, I can assure you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2072)|
| 0:34:37| But we certainly appreciate, like I said, the recognition and your time and effort and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2077)|
| 0:34:43| just showing a level of appreciation for the job that these folks do every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2083)|
| 0:34:46| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2086)|
| 0:34:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2087)|
| 0:34:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2088)|
| 0:35:00| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2100)|
| 0:35:01| And that video was wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| That was quite moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2103)|
| 0:35:05| Kudos to everyone that had any part of pulling all of that together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2105)|
| 0:35:10| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2110)|
| 0:35:15| Next agenda item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2115)|
| 0:35:18| Next item is public forum for agenda items only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2118)|
| 0:35:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2122)|
| 0:35:23| And we have two speakers that have signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2123)|
| 0:35:27| The first one is Sherry Garrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2127)|
| 0:35:33| Ms. Garrett, if you'd give your name and county of residence, and you have three minutes to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2133)|
| 0:35:37| speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2137)|
| 0:35:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2144)|
| 0:35:45| My name is Sherry Garrett, and I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2145)|
| 0:35:48| First of all, I would like to thank each and every one of you for your service on the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2148)|
| 0:35:51| I believe each and every one of you is doing an excellent job representing your districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2151)|
| 0:35:57| But when has this commission decided it must determine how each district is represented?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2157)|
| 0:36:01| When has this commission decided they should have a say in how another commissioner votes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2161)|
| 0:36:06| As has always been, voters determine the representation of each and every district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2166)|
| 0:36:09| If a voter is unhappy with the representation, they have an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2169)|
| 0:36:13| They can either run against them in the next election or vote them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2173)|
| 0:36:18| This resolution and ordinance to change the beer board before you appears to be one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| those situations where some commissioners are unhappy with the way another district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2182)|
| 0:36:26| not their own, is represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2186)|
| 0:36:29| After listening to the Rules Committee in last week's work session, this change is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2189)|
| 0:36:32| address the religious conviction of some of the commissioners in granting beer licenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| while they do vote on restrictions and fines for illegal actions by some of those who would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2195)|
| 0:36:40| hold those licenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2200)|
| 0:36:41| Yet, I have not seen any harm done to any constituent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2201)|
| 0:36:45| Has anyone been denied a permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| Has anyone been punished unjustly for their infractions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2207)|
| 0:36:51| I heard last week that the beer board chair received six phone calls from constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2211)|
| 0:36:54| who were unhappy that their commissioner would vote on their fine, yet not vote to grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2214)|
| 0:36:58| their license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2218)|
| 0:36:59| Were those six unhappy they were levied fines and feel they were punished unjustly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2219)|
| 0:37:04| While the intent for this change may be honorable in giving those who do not wish to serve on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2224)|
| 0:37:08| the beer board an out, this change removes representation from the public, even with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| an at-large commissioner on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| It makes it appear that religious freedoms of some commissioners are being targeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2234)|
| 0:37:17| There are many reasons why the beer board could be chosen to change to a committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2237)|
| 0:37:24| but commissioners' religious convictions should not be one of those reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2244)|
| 0:37:27| If the constituents are upset with their commissioner and how they are represented, they should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2247)|
| 0:37:33| be encouraged to reach out to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| In the event their commissioner is unresponsive or unavailable, they have two other commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| to reach out to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| I am asking that each and every one of you vote no to this resolution and ordinance change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2260)|
| 0:37:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2264)|
| 0:37:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2269)|
| 0:37:50| The next speaker is Greg Mills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2270)|
| 0:38:01| Mr. Mills, if you would give your name and county of residence, you have three minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2281)|
| 0:38:04| to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2284)|
| 0:38:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2285)|
| 0:38:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2286)|
| 0:38:07| I am Greg Mills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2287)|
| 0:38:08| I am Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2288)|
| 0:38:09| I want to speak about this Resolution 211 tonight, this $50,000 survey by Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2289)|
| 0:38:15| Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2295)|
| 0:38:17| They say they want to survey key stakeholders, but I don't see where anyone in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2297)|
| 0:38:21| not you, the school system, or anybody, actually defined who these key stakeholders are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2301)|
| 0:38:26| Indeed, the vendor on page 4 and 11 of the proposal uses two different definitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2306)|
| 0:38:31| So you are spending $50,000 for a survey you don't even know who is answering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2311)|
| 0:38:36| So that's, to me, a big waste of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2316)|
| 0:38:40| And even on page 8, they go further, they say they are using a United Nations methodology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2320)|
| 0:38:45| for their survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2325)|
| 0:38:46| So the community could include people from Timbuktu, the way you defined it, who knows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2326)|
| 0:38:51| or people from, you know, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., and New York, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2331)|
| 0:38:56| So I would hope you would defer this until the definition of key stakeholders can get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2336)|
| 0:39:01| cleaned up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| Maybe you've already, I don't know, or else it's kind of a useless, just waste of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2343)|
| 0:39:08| You don't know who's answering it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2348)|
| 0:39:11| And the other thing I would hope, this gives me the opportunity to say, I hope you're wise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2351)|
| 0:39:17| getting wise to these kind of games of what's going on in, you know, other parts of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2357)|
| 0:39:21| world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2361)|
| 0:39:22| Because what we saw when you were doing your normal business in the fall of 2019 is groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2362)|
| 0:39:29| were planning the pandemic, you know, preparedness, and what do we get out of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2369)|
| 0:39:34| People being told to shove COVID patients into nursing homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2374)|
| 0:39:39| So get ahead of the nonsense this time and pass up, you know, right now they're working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2379)|
| 0:39:44| on programmable digital currencies, which only work in some places and not everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2384)|
| 0:39:50| So it's basically communism or corporate fascism on the demand curve instead of the supply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2390)|
| 0:39:57| curve like the Soviet Union did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| So also pass a simple, you know, ordinance that doesn't require or that would ban the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2399)|
| 0:40:05| exclusive use of programmable digital currencies, and I think it will stop the next round of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2405)|
| 0:40:09| nonsense that appears to be heading our way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2409)|
| 0:40:12| So two things I'd ask for you tonight is, one, reject this resolution until the definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2412)|
| 0:40:17| of key stakeholders can be cleaned up, and also require that definition to include taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2417)|
| 0:40:24| I'll paraphrase, I caught the end of your previous meeting, so I'll paraphrase my words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2424)|
| 0:40:28| from what I heard, not the speaker's, but basically your taxpayer sounds like they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2428)|
| 0:40:32| starting to run out of money, so they need to have a voice in this survey as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2432)|
| 0:40:36| And the other thing, like I said, pass an ordinance that would not allow exclusively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2436)|
| 0:40:42| programmable digital currency to be used in Knox County by your businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2442)|
| 0:40:45| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2445)|
| 0:40:48| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2448)|
| 0:40:52| Next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=2452)|

| 0:56:04| and I remember as a a citizen that I would sometimes come before Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3364)|

| 0:56:15| or my ask as a citizen and so because I'm hearing that this structure would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3375)|
| 0:56:19| not include public forum and I was going to ask Director Moyers and because it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3379)|
| 0:56:28| we're considering changing it to optional and because no votes or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3388)|
| 0:56:33| decisions or actions are taken how does that impact public forum? Well there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3393)|
| 0:56:41| actually a statute that requires public forum on all public meetings but it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3401)|
| 0:56:46| makes exception for meetings that have no actionable items and as this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3406)|

| 0:57:03| there is a concern about fewer opportunities for public forum you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3423)|
| 0:57:09| add a public forum session section to the zoning session I mean right now we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3429)|
| 0:57:14| had a public forum for zonings I think but I mean you could certainly add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3434)|
| 0:57:20| actually the state law would require you to have a public forum meeting at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3440)|
| 0:57:24| your zoning agenda so people could speak then if you wanted to open it up to any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3444)|
| 0:57:29| topic people could come during zonings and and speak what to whatever topic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3449)|
| 0:57:34| they wished and in a week you would have your regular agenda meeting so if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3454)|
| 0:57:38| somebody wanted to speak to something that was on the regular agenda they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3458)|
| 0:57:42| could come to the zoning meeting you could put it at the beginning of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3462)|

| 0:57:59| a public forum at this one-hour review might be problematic because all of your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3479)|
| 0:58:04| time might be taken up with public forum nothing says you couldn't add that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3484)|
| 0:58:07| section to your zoning agenda and give people two opportunities to come in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3487)|

| 0:58:16| add public forum to the agenda review if we see that I mean you could but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3496)|
| 0:58:23| would just remind you that as we've pointed out you've got an out and if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3503)|
| 0:58:28| do public forum in the manner that that we do now with everybody getting three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3508)|
| 0:58:33| minutes and you haven't you know a hot topic your entire review session might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3513)|

| 0:58:44| like this agenda review I think you are required to for the zoning session what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3524)|
| 0:58:49| what you can determine for zoning is whether you want to limit that to items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3529)|
| 0:58:54| on the agenda or just whatever or have two different public forum sessions like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3534)|

| 0:59:21| think public forum should be at the end there should be additional one at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3561)|
| 0:59:25| end of zoning's because at five o'clock zoning meeting starts and the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3565)|
| 0:59:30| that are there for zoning should be heard because that's their time after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3570)|
| 0:59:33| that we should have a public forum on the agenda any but he wants to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3573)|
| 0:59:38| about anything similar to what we do now is we have agenda items you can talk to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3578)|

| 1:00:24| don't think it should be optional I think there's too many lazy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3624)|
| 1:00:28| commissioners as it is not trying to calling about individually but I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3628)|
| 1:00:31| they should show up and do the time and put it in it's in the middle of day I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3631)|
| 1:00:35| think every head of every department should be there and this way if the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3635)|

| 1:00:53| putting something on our public forum getting comments on it making anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3653)|
| 1:00:57| aware and noticed but I like this a lot I think if we can make a couple tweaks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3657)|
| 1:01:04| to it it would be great and we're not losing a lot we're just kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3664)|
| 1:01:08| reshuffling the deck and making it more streamlined but those are my opinions on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3668)|
| 1:01:14| it for right now Thank You Commissioner Beeler Thank You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3674)|

| 1:01:27| thing that it's not mandatory now so you know that the work session is it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3687)|
| 1:01:34| not a voting meeting what you don't understand what I'm saying it it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3694)|
| 1:01:42| somewhat voluntary for Commissioners to attend the work session we all do it and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3702)|
| 1:01:46| my hope is we would continue to do it if if you make it completely non-voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3706)|
| 1:01:52| meeting so I think this accomplishes two really important things now I agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3712)|
| 1:02:00| with Commissioner Ward and and Commissioner Daley as well in the sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3720)|
| 1:02:05| that I don't think it's anybody's intent to try to diminish the public's input on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3725)|
| 1:02:12| on these things I don't think anybody's trying to you know muzzle the public and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3732)|
| 1:02:18| provide less opportunity that's not the intent there are two important things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3738)|
| 1:02:23| this does it gives zoning its own night and and that's something that I really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3743)|
| 1:02:28| felt like ought to happen for a while move zoning to the opposite Monday of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3748)|
| 1:02:33| the Commission meeting because you guys know the problem with that now and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3753)|
| 1:02:37| know well I don't have to say it you know it and the second thing it does is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3757)|
| 1:02:43| it essentially moves the work session or the equivalency of the work session from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3763)|
| 1:02:47| 5 o'clock to 3 o'clock and it makes it a non-voting meeting is that good or bad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3767)|
| 1:02:55| I think it's necessary if you're going to move zoning to 5 o'clock on the third| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3775)|
| 1:03:01| Monday which is where I think it should be can this be tweaked to maybe put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3781)|
| 1:03:07| beer board at a more optimal time can it be tweaked to allow the public to not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3787)|
| 1:03:12| feel like their voices are being silenced I think it could so I support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3792)|
| 1:03:19| the spirit of it I think it's sufficient so thank you thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3799)|

| 1:03:43| we're limiting the public input to us you know for several years we've tried| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3823)|
| 1:03:52| to discuss holding our meetings different days different times and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3832)|
| 1:03:56| suggestions have come up you know we've talked about moving the work session to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3836)|
| 1:04:01| an earlier hour we even talked about taking Commission from the five o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3841)|

| 1:04:10| easier on the staff so we can we can do those things you know I guess my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3850)|
| 1:04:18| question is is is what's wrong with the work session I think one of the big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3858)|
| 1:04:24| advantages is that if Commissioner Daly or Commissioner Jay is having a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3864)|
| 1:04:32| department head give us an overview of what's going on I may pick up something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3872)|
| 1:04:37| that I hadn't even thought about or have additional questions and I think we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3877)|
| 1:04:42| would lose some of that because you're trying to jam a whole agenda in in less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3882)|
| 1:04:47| than an hour the other thing is is you know does this need to happen you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3887)|

| 1:05:07| as it's posted just because I I don't see a problem with the work session if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3907)|
| 1:05:12| you want to change the time that's fine but we do get a lot of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3912)|

| 1:05:40| going to come up on the agenda and what's going to happen is you know one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3940)|

| 1:06:34| understanding is things will get added to the agenda as they do now the chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=3994)|
| 1:06:40| herself and at suggestion of other commissioners will take things off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=4000)|

| 1:06:56| non-consent to consent is when you vote to approve something at work session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=4016)|
| 1:07:02| then it'll go on to the consent agenda general but if you look at the past that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240520?start=4022)|
