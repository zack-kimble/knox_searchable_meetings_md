| 0:00:31| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=31)|
| 0:00:32| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=32)|
| 0:00:33| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=33)|
| 0:00:34| And Commissioner Biggs is out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=34)|
| 0:00:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=35)|
| 0:00:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=36)|
| 0:00:37| For those of you who are here, the way these meetings work, we will call on the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=37)|
| 0:00:40| as well as the Knoxville-Knox County Planning to give an overview of each agenda item that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=40)|
| 0:00:46| is before us, and then we'll engage in a debate, engage in a debate and a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=46)|
| 0:00:52| However, in order to clarify our agenda, I do want to call on Mr. King regarding item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=52)|
| 0:00:58| 42.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=58)|
| 0:00:59| Mr. Chairman, Members of the Commission, John King, 3604 Blow-Dry, Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=59)|
| 0:01:12| I seek assault recognition for the purpose of asking for a postponement for 90 days of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=72)|
| 0:01:22| item number 42 on your agenda, which is a rezoning of property off of Beverly Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=82)|
| 0:01:31| And that postponement affords us an opportunity to do what we have been telling people we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=91)|
| 0:01:38| would do, and that is we were telling them that after this rezoning was done, we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=98)|
| 0:01:47| be willing to meet with the city engineers and discuss issues with regard to the traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=107)|
| 0:01:53| situation to see if there was a way to mitigate problems there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=113)|
| 0:01:59| This delay, this postponement, gives us the chance to go ahead and meet with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=119)|
| 0:02:04| now and try to get that resolved and know where we're headed with them before this matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=124)|
| 0:02:12| comes up for a vote on the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=132)|
| 0:02:17| So I'd ask for a 90-day postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=137)|
| 0:02:21| I don't like to ask for a 90-day postponement, but I have dealt with city engineering in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=141)|
| 0:02:26| the past, and sometimes things don't move as quickly or as fast as you would hope they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=146)|
| 0:02:32| would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=152)|
| 0:02:33| At least that way we would have plenty of time to make that effort and undertake that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=153)|
| 0:02:38| task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=158)|
| 0:02:39| So I would ask for a 90-day postponement of that item on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=159)|
| 0:02:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=165)|
| 0:02:46| And in keeping with the program of the Chair, the postponement will be granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=166)|
| 0:02:52| I do have two lights on of commissioners that want to weigh in on this, Michelle Carringer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=172)|
| 0:02:56| and Brad Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=176)|
| 0:02:57| Commissioner Carringer, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=177)|
| 0:02:59| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=179)|
| 0:03:01| Yes, I'd like to weigh in on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=181)|
| 0:03:03| I'd like to ask Mr. Taylor to come to the podium, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=183)|
| 0:03:12| I am the commissioner that represents this district, and we have already had a withdrawal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=192)|
| 0:03:17| about a year and a half ago on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=197)|
| 0:03:22| The citizens in District 2 have paid to have a bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=202)|
| 0:03:27| You see all these mean people that have come out in this weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=207)|
| 0:03:31| We have been going through this, and I would like to ask the attorney for the constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=211)|
| 0:03:38| that oppose this to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=218)|
| 0:03:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=222)|
| 0:03:43| I'm Charles Taylor, attorney for the opponents of this redevelopment, and we strongly oppose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=223)|
| 0:03:48| the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=228)|
| 0:03:50| As the commissioner indicated, we've gone to a great expense and trouble to be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=230)|
| 0:03:55| tonight, and if my neighbors could stand up and be recognized, I'd like you to see how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=235)|
| 0:04:00| many people showed up tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=240)|
| 0:04:08| This is not the first time we've shown up en masse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=248)|
| 0:04:13| This thing has been going on for two years, and from the very beginning, my neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=253)|
| 0:04:17| and I have been here to deal with it at every meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=257)|
| 0:04:21| Back in May of 2018, over 100 residents met with a developer to talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=261)|
| 0:04:27| In June of 2018, when it came before this commission, we showed up en masse again, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=267)|
| 0:04:32| when the developer realized he wasn't going to get the vote he needed, he withdrew it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=272)|
| 0:04:37| at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=277)|
| 0:04:38| Here again, we're doing the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=278)|
| 0:04:41| Just because the developer realizes that he's not going to get what he's requesting, he's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=281)|
| 0:04:46| trying to postpone it in the hope that we'll go away or at least we'll lose our enthusiasm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=286)|
| 0:04:50| for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=290)|
| 0:04:51| Again, my clients, it's not fair that we've been dealing with this for two years, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=291)|
| 0:04:56| at every opportunity to have it heard and on the merits, you know, something takes place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=296)|
| 0:05:01| to try to postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=301)|
| 0:05:03| So we respectfully ask that you go ahead and consider it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=303)|
| 0:05:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=306)|
| 0:05:07| I'd like to echo all we preach about is good government up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=307)|
| 0:05:19| Good government is taking care of our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=319)|
| 0:05:22| It's not right to have something on the agenda and have all these people come out at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=322)|
| 0:05:29| time of the hour and then it not to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=329)|
| 0:05:34| More time for the city, I realize that the city is not even being contacted on this and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=334)|
| 0:05:40| Mr. Gannard has had plenty of time to get with the city, so I very humbly ask my commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=340)|
| 0:05:46| to please deny this postponement of 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=346)|
| 0:05:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=350)|
| 0:05:51| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=351)|
| 0:05:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=352)|
| 0:05:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=353)|
| 0:05:54| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=354)|
| 0:05:55| Well, I was going to speak to Mr. King and the 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=355)|
| 0:06:00| I went and took a look at the property and, you know, not only am I concerned about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=360)|
| 0:06:06| egress and ingress of the property, you know, in our district we've got Harold Road Stormwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=366)|
| 0:06:14| Park that does a great job of facilitating and helping keep the water in the area, slowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=374)|
| 0:06:22| the floodwaters down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=382)|
| 0:06:24| Since they've instilled that, I don't think Harold Road's been underwater but twice in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=384)|
| 0:06:27| the last seven or eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=387)|
| 0:06:30| And so in that 90 days, if it's granted, I would hope that you would, I would want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=390)|
| 0:06:34| ask that you have conversations with county as to what they were going to do or you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=394)|
| 0:06:39| going to do on that property that slows the water down like they've done in Harold Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=399)|
| 0:06:43| Park, if that's in the discussion, because really that's, I mean, that's the key element| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=403)|
| 0:06:50| here is for everybody is what's it do downstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=410)|
| 0:06:54| Now it's possible to slow down rain flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=414)|
| 0:06:56| I've seen it happen on Harold Road Park, but until there's a plan and a commitment or a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=416)|
| 0:07:01| plan and a desire to go that route, I'd like for you to look into that more in that 90| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=421)|
| 0:07:05| days as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=425)|
| 0:07:06| Very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=426)|
| 0:07:08| We'll be happy to do that, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=428)|
| 0:07:11| And we attempted to have a meeting with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=431)|
| 0:07:18| It wasn't very well attended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=438)|
| 0:07:20| By the way, I want to make a point of order just for ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=440)|
| 0:07:23| Mr. King, I called on you just because, you know, if this is not going to happen, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=443)|
| 0:07:29| okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=449)|
| 0:07:30| I wanted to find out, you know, right before he transitioned, I heard that you all were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=450)|
| 0:07:35| planning on postponing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=455)|
| 0:07:38| And considering how many folks that we had here, you know, out of fairness to them, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=458)|
| 0:07:42| wanted to kind of clarify that that was the absolute case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=462)|
| 0:07:45| And then I'll reference probably with a quick question to the law director based on precedent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=465)|
| 0:07:51| of, you know, how we handle this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=471)|
| 0:07:53| Ultimately, we have to handle all zoning matters in a consistent manner, because at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=473)|
| 0:07:59| the merits, the pros and cons of this, that the resolution is not actually on the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=479)|
| 0:08:05| for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=485)|
| 0:08:06| You know, the only thing that the chair has allowed is really just to find out a clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=486)|
| 0:08:13| on your intent to postpone it, and then to get a clarification from the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=493)|
| 0:08:19| on, you know, just verifying our processes on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=499)|
| 0:08:25| So with that said, previously, I recognize, with that question for you, Mr. King, I recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=505)|
| 0:08:31| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=511)|
| 0:08:32| Her light is on, but I do have to, in accordance with Robert's rules, recognize the other commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=512)|
| 0:08:36| who have also spoken on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=516)|
| 0:08:39| So I believe that was Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=519)|
| 0:08:43| Go ahead, Commissioner Gill, and then I'll be back to Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=523)|
| 0:08:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, because that was my procedural question, the one you just posed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=526)|
| 0:08:50| about what you've already, that was the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=530)|
| 0:08:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=533)|
| 0:08:54| So procedurally, you validated his intent, but we're not even at the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=534)|
| 0:08:59| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=539)|
| 0:09:00| We're not even at the agenda, but out of obligation for all these folks, I know there was a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=540)|
| 0:09:04| items down, and I didn't want us to go that far if that's their intent to postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=544)|
| 0:09:10| However, my question about that clarification did trigger some lights, and I'm here to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=550)|
| 0:09:16| for you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=556)|
| 0:09:17| I want to make sure that we get heard as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=557)|
| 0:09:20| So Daniel, I'm going to come to you, but I do want to recognize Commissioner Bussler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=560)|
| 0:09:23| then I'll be going to Daniel Sanders from the Law Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=563)|
| 0:09:26| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=566)|
| 0:09:29| About 38 years ago, this property came up before MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=569)|
| 0:09:33| I was on MPC at that time, and we made a suggestion for the community to see what could be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=573)|
| 0:09:42| to lessen the flooding out there, and we asked that study to be done, and it dropped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=582)|
| 0:09:49| And that was over 38 years ago, and the same issues are coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=589)|
| 0:09:54| I hope that you can reach an agreement with someone to take care of the problem out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=594)|
| 0:10:00| because if you don't, 38 years from this time down the road, it'll come up again about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=600)|
| 0:10:06| flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=606)|
| 0:10:07| And there's things that you can do to lessen that flooding, and if you've got somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=607)|
| 0:10:12| that wants to work with you all on the roads, the city-owned, I think the city controls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=612)|
| 0:10:18| the roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=618)|
| 0:10:20| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=620)|
| 0:10:21| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=621)|
| 0:10:22| But now, I'm just asking, please work together to take care of that problem, because 38 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=622)|
| 0:10:28| ago, if we'd worked together, we might have not been in here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=628)|
| 0:10:32| So just remember that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=632)|
| 0:10:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=633)|
| 0:10:34| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=634)|
| 0:10:35| I want to direct my question now to Daniel Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=635)|
| 0:10:37| When we have a, this has been before us before, it was postponed, and based on rules of engagement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=637)|
| 0:10:45| here at this body, I want to get your take on moving forward on addressing this request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=645)|
| 0:10:53| for postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=653)|
| 0:10:57| The request for postponement is at the discretion of the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=657)|
| 0:11:03| So at this point, it's not an automatic request in a grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=663)|
| 0:11:09| It's been made at the meeting, he's present, and it's up to the pleasure of the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=669)|
| 0:11:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=676)|
| 0:11:18| So with that said, what I'm going to do as chair, I'm going to ask for a motion to accept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=678)|
| 0:11:25| the request for a, Mr. Law Director, I'm going to ask for clarification, would a proper motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=685)|
| 0:11:32| for this body to rule on that, would it be to accept the request for deferral?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=692)|
| 0:11:38| Is that the proper motion, and we would vote on that, and then the next vote would be on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=698)|
| 0:11:42| the motion that is before us, because we've had a request come to us to have this deferred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=702)|
| 0:11:47| for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=707)|
| 0:11:49| Would the proper vote be to have a vote first on the merits of the request for a deferment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=709)|
| 0:11:57| for 90 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=717)|
| 0:11:58| If that passes, then that would put us to where we could actually then get back to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=718)|
| 0:12:03| agenda, although I could probably move this one up to the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=723)|
| 0:12:07| And then move on to vote of the actual merits or pros or cons of the actual request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=727)|
| 0:12:14| So there's been a request to the body to grant a deferral for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=734)|
| 0:12:21| In order for the body to act, sometimes the deferrals are granted without objection, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=741)|
| 0:12:26| I don't think this is a matter of objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=746)|
| 0:12:29| So if there is the desire among any of the members to grant the deferral, there needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=749)|
| 0:12:36| to be a motion, a second, and an affirmative vote of the majority of the membership that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=756)|
| 0:12:40| we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=760)|
| 0:12:42| So the motion would be, to clarify, someone would need to make a motion to accept the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=762)|
| 0:12:48| deferral with a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=768)|
| 0:12:51| Or to grant the deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=771)|
| 0:12:53| To grant the deferral, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=773)|
| 0:12:54| But it's not necessary that you make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=774)|
| 0:12:58| If there's not a motion and not a second, this is not an agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=778)|
| 0:13:04| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=784)|
| 0:13:05| I'm just, in fairness to the body, I want to make sure that we give this due diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=785)|
| 0:13:10| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=790)|
| 0:13:11| So if you have a motion and it's seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=791)|
| 0:13:14| With the proper motion, actually, to be clear, to deny the postponement rather than to accept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=794)|
| 0:13:19| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=799)|
| 0:13:20| Would that be, or can you make a motion on a?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=800)|
| 0:13:21| Mr. Chairman, can I make a point of order?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=801)|
| 0:13:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=803)|
| 0:13:24| You don't have any kind of action before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=804)|
| 0:13:27| You asked if there was objection, there's objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=807)|
| 0:13:29| I feel like it, I mean, I have more questions than answers on whether or not we delay it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=809)|
| 0:13:34| or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=814)|
| 0:13:35| But you don't have an action before the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=815)|
| 0:13:38| There's objection to the automatic postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=818)|
| 0:13:40| I think you should go down the agenda and let it run its course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=820)|
| 0:13:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=824)|
| 0:13:45| That's what we'll do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=826)|
| 0:13:47| So we have, Mr. King, you've expressed that you all would like to have a deferment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=827)|
| 0:13:51| We will get to that when we get to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=831)|
| 0:13:53| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=833)|
| 0:13:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=834)|
| 0:13:55| You've not been recognized, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=835)|
| 0:13:56| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=836)|
| 0:13:57| We're going to move on with the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=837)|
| 0:13:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=838)|
| 0:13:59| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=839)|

| 0:19:09| Thank you to the applicant, John King for the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1149)|
| 0:19:10| All of the applications are considered to be transformative programs initally projected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1150)|
| 0:19:11| prior to the funding announcement from the Appropriationsкs and solicitation foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1151)|
| 0:19:12| Since thus plan was to finch out the criminal justice department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1152)|
| 0:19:34| I appreciate the hard work and effort put in by the staff and I appreciate the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1174)|
| 0:19:42| I would note in response to some of the things the opposing counsel said and some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1182)|
| 0:19:50| others about fair is fair or this is not fair, I would remind everybody that in addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1190)|
| 0:19:59| to the involvement of time on the neighborhood's part, there's also involvement of time and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1199)|
| 0:20:06| money on the part of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1206)|
| 0:20:10| So it's not just all one-sided in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1210)|
| 0:20:15| Having said all that, Mr. Chairman, applicant at this time withdraws its application for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1215)|
| 0:20:22| rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1222)|
| 0:20:23| Thank you, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1223)|
| 0:20:31| For the record, the applicant has withdrawn it and I will ask for clarification to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1231)|
| 0:20:38| law department when an applicant, this is for the public and anybody who may be watching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1238)|
| 0:20:42| at home, Mr. Sanders, could you clarify what happens when an application is withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1242)|
| 0:20:50| Upon the withdrawal of an application, there is no further matter for the commission to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1250)|
| 0:20:53| consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1253)|
| 0:20:54| I mean, and I'm talking about a timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1254)|
| 0:21:00| If the applicant wants to develop the property for uses that are already permitted within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1260)|
| 0:21:05| the zoning district, they need to apply to the Metropolitan Planning Commission to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1265)|
| 0:21:10| a rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1270)|
| 0:21:13| And it's a one-year timeline on that, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1273)|
| 0:21:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| If it's the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1277)|
| 0:21:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1279)|
| 0:21:20| It would have to be substantially different than the new application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1280)|
| 0:21:25| Unless the new application is substantially different, there is a time limit of one year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1285)|
| 0:21:31| before a reapplication can be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1291)|
| 0:21:33| It would have to be a determination by the planning staff or the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1293)|
| 0:21:37| that the application is substantially different in order for it to be received prior to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1297)|
| 0:21:42| one-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1302)|
| 0:21:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1303)|
| 0:21:44| Thank you, Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1304)|
| 0:21:45| Yes, Mr. Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1305)|
| 0:21:46| My question is for Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1306)|
| 0:21:47| I know we don't have any action on this anymore, but under current zoning, we have seen a potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1307)|
| 0:21:53| plan of apartments and some lot industrial along the floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1313)|
| 0:21:58| Is that possible in the current zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1318)|
| 0:22:00| That's possible under the current zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1320)|
| 0:22:02| The density of the apartment development, residential development, would be determined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1322)|
| 0:22:07| both by the RB zoning and the underlying sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1327)|
| 0:22:10| But the apartments on the ridge and the industrial and the flatter floodplain area is permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1330)|
| 0:22:16| by the existing zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1336)|
| 0:22:17| Without rezoning for this commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1337)|
| 0:22:19| Without rezoning and without a public review of site plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1339)|
| 0:22:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1343)|
| 0:22:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1345)|
| 0:22:26| Is there any other comments on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1348)|
| 0:22:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1349)|
| 0:22:30| Madam Clerk, next item, which should be item 39.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1350)|
| 0:22:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1354)|

| 0:22:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1359)|
| 0:22:40| I just think we just need to appreciate the opposition that showed up and just make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1360)|
| 0:22:44| there are no outstanding questions before we proceed from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1364)|
| 0:22:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1368)|

| 0:22:53| It's moving along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1373)|

| 0:22:55| Move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1375)|

| 0:23:09| Be a little quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1389)|
| 0:23:11| That's an interesting turn of events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=1391)|

| 0:42:56| to go back to Daniel real quick for just other clarification. Daniel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2576)|
| 0:43:00| what was this other section that you lean the microphone so we can hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2580)|
| 0:43:05| Subsection F may apply here it's up to you to interpret the rules. It essentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2585)|
| 0:43:11| says that if the applicant isn't present. Can you lean up? I apologize I can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2591)|
| 0:43:17| ever tell I don't have enough practice of this to tell when people can hear me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2597)|
| 0:43:20| or not. But subsection F essentially says that when the applicant is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2600)|
| 0:43:26| present when they at when the item is first called and it be pushed the heels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2606)|
| 0:43:32| of the agenda if they're not present the second time when it's called the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2612)|
| 0:43:36| second time and then it's automatically deferred. This has been deferred a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2616)|
| 0:43:41| times. I don't know if any of those were for failure to appear but and whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2621)|
| 0:43:48| that whether the applicant was here at the beginning of the meeting or at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2628)|
| 0:43:53| time the item was called it's up to Commission to interpret its rules here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2633)|
| 0:44:00| Well what I'd like to do is maybe handle this we just had one kind of similar to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2640)|
| 0:44:06| this earlier which sort of set a precedent when we had something at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2646)|
| 0:44:09| a verbally and I'm not seeing a email to back it up but I'll tell you John Valiant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2649)|
| 0:44:14| told me before this meeting started that it was his intent to defer it so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2654)|
| 0:44:20| but I don't have a time stamp and I don't have an email from him even though| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2660)|
| 0:44:23| I gave him my email so with the proper way based on how we handled the Beverly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2663)|
| 0:44:29| Road. The Beverly Road one was a bit different because the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2669)|
| 0:44:35| was here. Okay all right but I like say there's there's some gray area here and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2675)|
| 0:44:42| your rules. Mr. Chairman. Yeah go ahead I'll hear you. You've got your light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2682)|
| 0:44:50| He had his one deferral. He did not request he's not here to request a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2690)|
| 0:44:58| postponement or another deferral. He knew that he was supposed to be here and he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2698)|
| 0:45:07| did this needs to be heard. My only question is if we do and I have a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2707)|
| 0:45:11| on the floor. Daniel if we do proceed to vote to hear this is that going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2711)|
| 0:45:19| jeopardize us as far of course I can make the motion to withdraw completely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2719)|
| 0:45:24| because he's not here. It's just a second actually his third time here and he's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2724)|
| 0:45:28| not here. I could make the motion to withdraw the whole application. This is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2728)|
| 0:45:35| his first failure to appear. Yeah this would be. I don't like it either but it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2735)|
| 0:45:41| his first place. You withdraw. Mr. Daly slides to the floor. Daniel. I am not aware of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2741)|
| 0:45:50| whether this applicant has failed to appear the first time. If he had failed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2750)|
| 0:45:56| appear. He did not. He asked in writing to defer till this month. Okay. In writing. Just a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2756)|
| 0:46:03| second Mr. J. All right Mr. J have you got a question about that? I just wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2763)|
| 0:46:08| it says here this may help move things along. It says here in section F that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2768)|
| 0:46:13| attendance of the zoning session by the applicant or representative for a zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2773)|
| 0:46:17| or plan amendment should be required for Commission action. If the applicant is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2777)|
| 0:46:20| not present when the item is first read it shall automatically be placed at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2780)|
| 0:46:25| end of the agenda. If the item applicant is not present when the item is reached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2785)|
| 0:46:30| again the agenda should be placed on the Commission agenda for the following| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2790)|
| 0:46:33| month. So it's been read no one is here. It automatically gets sent to the end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2793)|
| 0:46:38| of our agenda so we should move to the next item. If they are not here at when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2798)|
| 0:46:43| we read it again it says shall be placed on the Commission agenda for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2803)|
| 0:46:48| following month. The item shall be placed on the agenda for the following month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| for the applicants failure to attend only once automatically. If the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2810)|
| 0:46:55| applicant fails to attend the subsequent zoning session the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2815)|
| 0:46:58| applicant shall be deemed withdrawn unless Commission votes otherwise. So the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2818)|
| 0:47:03| proper rule is to send it to the end of the agenda move on with zoning. If| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2823)|
| 0:47:07| they're not here again the rule says it's sent to next month automatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2827)|
| 0:47:11| There's not really a vote yes or no according to the rules. Do you interpret that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2831)|
| 0:47:15| at the same way? I would interpret it in the same same way. I drew your attention to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2835)|
| 0:47:19| rule F. Commissioner Daley still has the floor. Thank you for that insight as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2839)|

| 0:47:46| Valiant talked to you correct? Correct. And he inferred to you that he wanted it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2866)|
| 0:47:52| he inferred that he wanted it to be deferred. Did you give him any positive or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2872)|
| 0:47:57| negative things? I told him to send it to me in email. I had a written of it. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2877)|

| 0:48:46| told me. So all right so let's move on with the agenda and stay stay right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2926)|

| 0:49:28| All right thank you Madam Clerk. Mr. Andrews I've got a question for after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2968)|
| 0:49:34| Well I don't know if we should hear this until we hear the amendment or I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2974)|

| 0:49:42| then we'll move to Mr. Mullins. I'll try to wrap all the items up in one. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2982)|
| 0:49:50| Planning Commission heard a request for rezoning of this property to to a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2990)|
| 0:49:55| commercial. That request the recommendation on that request was for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2995)|
| 0:49:59| denial. At your meeting in September you got the appeal of that recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=2999)|
| 0:50:10| denial was on your agenda. You deferred it to this meeting and instructed planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=3010)|
| 0:50:15| staff to look at amending the the thank you this needs to be longer to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=3015)|
| 0:50:27| amending the standards in the neighborhood commercial zoning district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=3027)|
| 0:50:31| to identify vehicle repair as a use on review. Staff did that presented that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=3031)|
| 0:50:37| amendment to the Planning Commission. The amendment had several conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=3037)|
| 0:50:41| that to try to address the issues surrounding vehicle repair. Length of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=3041)|
| 0:50:46| time that a vehicle could be on site. Screening location of vehicles on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=3046)|
| 0:50:52| site. The setbacks of the facility from neighborhood zoning districts. Noise no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=3052)|
| 0:51:00| not noise but the overnight storage of vehicles the outdoor storage of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=3060)|
| 0:51:04| materials and equipment. The Planning Commission unanimously recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=3064)|
| 0:51:09| denial of that zoning amendment for due to concerns of the impact of vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=3069)|
| 0:51:16| repair on adjacent neighborhoods. Neighborhood commercial districts are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=3076)|
| 0:51:19| surrounded by residential neighborhoods. The Planning Commission unanimously felt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=3079)|
| 0:51:23| that vehicle repair was not an appropriate service to be located in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=3083)|
| 0:51:30| residential area. Subsequent to that denial the applicant for the initial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=3090)|
| 0:51:37| rezoning appeal the denial of the zoning amendment and that's where we are this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=3097)|

| 0:51:59| Planning Commission and I guess it's a it's an issue of the blanket covering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=3119)|

| 0:55:11| without the ordinance change right but what I'm saying is is one of our options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=3311)|
| 0:55:17| to just send this back for sector plan change this is one option I think a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=3317)|
| 0:55:21| better option or option that would be recommended by staff by staff to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=3321)|
| 0:55:30| by amending the sector plan to amend the zoning ordinance to allow I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=3330)|

| 0:55:58| appropriate than others and the Planning Commission could deny that use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=3358)|
| 0:56:01| where it's not appropriate but the sector plan amendment we're putting a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=3361)|
| 0:56:06| sector plan designation in an area where it is not appropriate okay so what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=3366)|
| 0:56:16| MPC if we are moving forward to recommendation is to deny the appeal and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=3376)|

| 1:04:20| long conversation with them outside and explained to them what our concept is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=3860)|
| 1:04:25| and we haven't heard from them since they are still opposed and then that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=3865)|
| 1:04:31| something that's important because that was the the property owner adjacent to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=3871)|
| 1:04:34| them if we look at the rezoning we're looking at a 50-foot peripheral it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=3874)|

| 1:12:39| on the side of Commissioner Schoonmaker we just interpret the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=4359)|
| 1:12:45| commercial as being very restrictive and limited primarily to serve the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=4365)|
| 1:12:51| residents in the immediate area so personal services we feel would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=4371)|

| 1:14:06| debates was is a five-day limit or a 30-day limit on time on storage and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=4446)|

| 1:14:17| talking about that change to the neighborhood commercial and the thing in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=4457)|
| 1:14:20| front of us is actually the zoning appeal but I do want to get back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=4460)|
| 1:14:23| Commissioner Anders mr. Hill so in essence under the current neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=4463)|
| 1:14:30| commercial zoning you can store five forklifts out there on a trailer all day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=4470)|
| 1:14:33| long yes and there's and but to look at and and I'm okay and I don't know if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=4473)|
| 1:14:39| it's feasible or not but you know all all on car cars parked in the rear of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=4479)|
| 1:14:45| the building have to be screened with with a fence or something like that but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=4485)|
| 1:14:50| I don't understand how a United Rentals right there would fit but a a car lot or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=4490)|
| 1:15:00| a car repair shop would not fit I agree wholeheartedly with you you know I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=4500)|
| 1:15:06| we probably ought to revisit some of those uses you know fueling stations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=4506)|
| 1:15:12| when you think of fueling stations you know for years you saw the little two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=4512)|
| 1:15:16| pump one two pump Texacos out there that wasn't that intrusive and you didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=4516)|
| 1:15:23| have a lot you know as long as you don't have a lot of outdoor storage but I agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=4523)|
| 1:15:27| with you I think that's that's an inappropriate use for neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=4527)|
| 1:15:30| commercial it's permitted so we would have to basically approve that and and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=4530)|
| 1:15:39| so I think all the things that you described though the the place on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=4539)|
| 1:15:43| Kingston Park and I mean those are in commercial zones not neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=4543)|
| 1:15:46| commercial those are surrounded by commercial that's correct and that's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=4546)|
| 1:15:50| lack of codes enforcement not a lack of proper zoning that's exactly my point in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=4550)|
| 1:15:55| in the most obvious and intense abuses we can't even enforce it and so are we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=4555)|
| 1:16:01| going to now apply it to neighborhood commercial when we know we can't even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=4561)|
| 1:16:05| enforce it in the most intense areas of our city or county that's the only point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=4565)|
| 1:16:11| I want to make okay thank you I mean I guess my question is I mean do you are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=4571)|
| 1:16:18| we on the ordinance are we on the rezoning that that's just it I kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=4578)|
| 1:16:21| want to get the item before us is actually the appeal specifically and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=4581)|
| 1:16:26| want to try and get us I get it everything is related and I think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=4586)|
| 1:16:30| important for everybody to have all that on the table but we do need to get down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=4590)|
| 1:16:34| to the appeal specifically in order to come to a conclusion one way or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=4594)|
| 1:16:40| other I know this is all related so let's discuss this I want to get the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=4600)|
| 1:16:45| discussion back specifically to the appeal and maybe evolve away from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=4605)|
| 1:16:51| discussion on neighborhood commercial or at least just try to figure out a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=4611)|
| 1:16:54| solution that we're gonna move forward you know hearing everything I'm weighing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=4614)|
| 1:16:57| in not as chair but as Hugh you know I've heard so much about potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=4617)|
| 1:17:02| diluting a neighborhood commercial yeah I kind of go back to we've really given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=4622)|
| 1:17:07| this due diligence I mean but is it right for us to maybe to grant the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=4627)|
| 1:17:11| appeal but then put a whole lot of restrictions on this I mean I wonder if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=4631)|
| 1:17:15| that's and that way we've we've kept neighborhood commercial intact as it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=4635)|

| 1:32:41| Thank you, Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5561)|
| 1:32:48| Dannerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5568)|
| 1:32:59| Yes, there will be areas that need further attention and the stakeholder group is committed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5579)|
| 1:33:05| to identifying those areas and working through them as this ordinance is put into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5585)|
| 1:33:11| However, we feel that the ordinance as currently written and presented to you is a great starting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5591)|
| 1:33:18| point and we urge you to pass the ordinance on second reading as it currently stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5598)|
| 1:33:26| Again, thank you for considering the public interest and allowing us to be a part of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5606)|
| 1:33:35| Thank you, Ms. Starbuck. Mr. Baylor, are you still on the floor? Are you set up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5615)|
| 1:33:39| Okay, all right. I think we have Commissioner Anderson, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5619)|
| 1:33:44| After the discussion that we've had tonight and speaking with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5624)|
| 1:33:50| and looking at those areas, I guess, more along the line, Daniel, if we pass this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5630)|
| 1:33:56| so we passed it as amended that did not include rural areas and if we passed it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5636)|
| 1:34:06| according to Commissioner Smith, would that be a significant change and would it be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5646)|
| 1:34:13| first reading again? It'd be back to first reading. If it wasn't when it came off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5653)|
| 1:34:16| why would it be when it goes back on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5656)|
| 1:34:21| There's a process and an analysis that you go through when you determine whether an amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5661)|
| 1:34:27| is a significant change. Can you speak into the microphone? I apologize. I still need to practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5667)|
| 1:34:31| a little bit to talk directly into the microphone and other people have had that problem too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5671)|
| 1:34:35| but I apologize. The courts direct the lawyers and the commission to go through an analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5675)|
| 1:34:44| when an amendment to a zoning ordinance amendment gets made. One of the steps in the analysis is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5684)|
| 1:34:53| determine whether the amendment would have changed Metropolitan Planning Commission's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5693)|
| 1:34:59| recommendation with respect to the zoning ordinance. I would wonder if one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5699)|
| 1:35:07| commissioners wants to pose the question whether MPC would have made a different recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5707)|
| 1:35:13| with consideration to the amendment. I'd consider that question posed just because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5713)|
| 1:35:24| the draft that went to the Planning Commission had it excluding the rural area. The Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5724)|
| 1:35:30| Commission discussed that and voted to approve the ordinance amendment as presented to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5730)|
| 1:35:38| with the revision to include all of the county and not to exclude the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5738)|
| 1:35:44| So, based on their action, my feeling is that they considered this and made their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5744)|
| 1:35:51| recommendation to include the entire application of the approval process to the entire county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5751)|
| 1:35:59| including the rural area, and considered and discussed that issue explicitly during their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5759)|
| 1:36:04| review of the request of the amendment. I don't know if that's an answer, at least once it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5764)|
| 1:36:14| not clear. The question posed to you, would that make it a change? Would it be a non-substantial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5774)|
| 1:36:21| change or a substantial change to determine if that's added? Does that mean is this on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5781)|
| 1:36:26| one or first rating, back to first rating or to second rating? If you could clarify based on what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5786)|
| 1:36:31| Mr. Green said, Daniel. So, it was passed the last time on first reading as amended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5791)|
| 1:36:38| so that would be a first reading. With consideration for that from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5798)|
| 1:36:46| Right, but one of the analysis that you go through to determine whether it's a substantial change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5806)|
| 1:36:53| is to ask MPC whether the change from first to second reading, if MPC would have made a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5813)|
| 1:37:02| different recommendation with the change, that is an indication that MPC would have made a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5822)|
| 1:37:07| different recommendation and the result would be a determination that it would be a substantial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5827)|
| 1:37:14| change, which would put you back to first reading. So, you want to add, if the Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5834)|
| 1:37:22| wants to add rules. I want to add back in what MPC wanted in it to begin with. I'm not sure how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5842)|
| 1:37:26| that's a significant change to the MPC. You passed an ordinance on first reading. You want to make a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5846)|
| 1:37:33| change between first and second reading. The analysis is to go through the, whether there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5853)|
| 1:37:38| a substantial change, and that analysis includes a question to MPC whether MPC would have made a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5858)|
| 1:37:45| different recommendation. I understand that MPC considered that, but you passed on first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5865)|
| 1:37:54| the ordinance amendment without the rule area in there, and now you want to add it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5874)|
| 1:38:02| All right. MPC is indicating that's a substantial change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5882)|
| 1:38:06| It's not substantial from what the Planning Commission brought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5886)|
| 1:38:12| Well, the analysis is, you're going through the steps. The amendment without the rule area was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5892)|
| 1:38:22| presented to Metropolitan Planning Commission. That's correct. That's correct. That's how it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5902)|
| 1:38:27| left staff. That's correct. And that was the amendment considered by the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5907)|
| 1:38:35| and Planning Commission added the rule area to it. That's correct. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5915)|
| 1:38:41| And it recommended approval of the amendment, including the rule area. That's correct. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5921)|
| 1:38:46| Then, County Commission adopted on first reading the amendment without rule area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5926)|
| 1:38:53| Okay. This indicates to me that Planning Commission would consider that a substantial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5933)|
| 1:39:00| change because it considered the amendment after the rule area. It itself added the rule area in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5940)|
| 1:39:06| there. Now, we've gone back to without the rule area, which is something that Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5946)|
| 1:39:11| did not recommend, and the analysis between first reading at County Commission and second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5951)|
| 1:39:17| reading at County Commission is whether the first reading and the second reading match one another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5957)|
| 1:39:25| substantially. And that analysis indicates that they do not, if you want to add the rule area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5965)|
| 1:39:33| back in there. All right. Thank you, Daniel. I'm going to move on to see, Brad, we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5973)|
| 1:39:40| were you on? And then I think, okay, got it. All right. Back to Commissioner. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5980)|
| 1:39:44| Beeler, your light's off. Commissioner Daly. Yeah. Just to anyone else in the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5984)|
| 1:39:49| I know Corinne was always, Corinne, you there? You want to speak on this or we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5989)|
| 1:39:55| looks like we may be going back to a first reading, so that'll be another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5995)|
| 1:39:59| opportunity for public input. I think, all right, what I'd like to do, it sounds kind of like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=5999)|
| 1:40:07| we're talking public forum related to this. I know we had one person, a few folks who signed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6007)|
| 1:40:11| up in the beginning who wanted to speak at public forum around this particular item. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6011)|
| 1:40:16| Starbuck, you've already spoken on this, but I do want to acknowledge if there's anybody else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6016)|
| 1:40:22| who would like to speak in the context of public forum on this matter, because there were some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6022)|
| 1:40:27| that had signed up before the commission meeting started, and I told them that I would wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6027)|
| 1:40:31| until this item was heard. So, I'll move on. Okay. Ma'am, if you could go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6031)|
| 1:40:39| No. Yeah. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6039)|
| 1:40:41| bottom line is, yes, if you want to speak on this item, I'll grant it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6041)|
| 1:40:47| I have a question. While that's happening, Commissioner Gill, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6047)|
| 1:40:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I need to see if I can seek clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6052)|
| 1:40:56| If the rule language has always been in the ordinance, how is it a substantial change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6056)|
| 1:41:03| if we follow through on that process and simply want to add it back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6063)|
| 1:41:07| Okay. Because it was always there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6067)|
| 1:41:16| Okay. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6076)|
| 1:41:17| Right. Metropolitan Planning Commission did recommend the language for the rural area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6077)|
| 1:41:27| to be included in the ordinance. You adopted it on first reading without that language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6087)|
| 1:41:33| Okay. And so, the way that this came through in Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6093)|
| 1:41:41| that indicates that Metropolitan Planning Commission would see this as a substantial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6101)|
| 1:41:45| change. It came to them without it. They added it. They recommended it with it in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6105)|
| 1:41:50| And I'll tell you, I'll support this another way. Another part of the analysis is the notice that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6110)|
| 1:41:54| goes out in between first and second reading has to give people an idea of whether their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6114)|
| 1:42:03| property is going to be affected by this ordinance. What parts of the county are going to be affected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6123)|
| 1:42:08| by this ordinance. It came through first reading. The rural areas were not going to be affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6128)|
| 1:42:14| If you want to add that back in, we need to give notice and let people in the county know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6134)|
| 1:42:18| whether their property is going to be affected by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6138)|
| 1:42:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6141)|
| 1:42:22| Is that clear, Commissioner Gill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6142)|
| 1:42:24| All right. Back to Ms. Starbuck. Ms. Montgomery, did you want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6144)|
| 1:42:32| Okay. All right. Ms. Starbuck, you'd already spoken on this, but I just want to see if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6152)|
| 1:42:35| there's anybody else before I come back to you. All right. Any other commissioners on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6155)|
| 1:42:40| All right. Ms. Starbuck, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6160)|
| 1:42:42| Thank you, Commissioner. I just wanted to ask, you know, this is on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6162)|
| 1:42:48| There was a public forum and, you know, everybody that spoke at the public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6168)|
| 1:42:53| was in favor of leaving the amendment as it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6173)|
| 1:42:57| Understand that Commissioner Smith has made a substitute motion, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6177)|
| 1:43:02| if you voted on the original motion, if you, you know, if the substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6182)|
| 1:43:07| failed and you voted on the original motion, would it not be second reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6187)|
| 1:43:12| Yes. To clarify that, to clarify your question, there's a substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6192)|
| 1:43:16| on the floor. If that substitute motion fails, then we're back to the original motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6196)|
| 1:43:21| which would be on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6201)|
| 1:43:22| Okay. Thank you. And I would just like to add that, you know, it was passed on first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6202)|
| 1:43:32| with the understanding that we would try it first in the planned growth areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6212)|
| 1:43:37| and then should there, should it work out great and there weren't any problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6217)|
| 1:43:43| that we would later go to the rural areas and consider, you know, using this tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6223)|
| 1:43:50| With regard to talking about the intersections of, you know, making big road changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6230)|
| 1:43:55| my understanding is that there's not anything until 2034 that's even going to come up on road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6235)|
| 1:44:01| changes. So it seems like there's a lot of time between now and then to make sure that we've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6241)|
| 1:44:06| this big change in ordinance correct before we go out into the rural areas and possibly make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6246)|
| 1:44:13| a mistake that can't be recovered from. Thank you. All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6253)|
| 1:44:16| Mr. Starbuck, when you say 2034, you're talking about TPO? Okay, that's state and highway roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6256)|
| 1:44:28| that's not local roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6268)|
| 1:44:31| We have those in the budget now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6271)|
| 1:44:33| All right, Ms. Starbuck, I can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6273)|
| 1:44:34| I said, so those are in the budget now, these big road changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6274)|
| 1:44:39| No, they're not in our five-year capital plan right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6279)|
| 1:44:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6282)|
| 1:44:43| I don't believe Mr. Snowden, are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6283)|
| 1:44:47| No, sir, but there'll be a request from my office coming your way very soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6287)|
| 1:44:53| All right. Very good. Thank you. All right. Let's, we have a substitute motion that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6293)|
| 1:44:58| made by Commissioner Smith. And who was the second on that? I want to, I know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6298)|
| 1:45:02| was that Commissioner Anders or who? You've made a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6302)|
| 1:45:08| All right, I wasn't sure who made the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6308)|
| 1:45:12| Okay. Well, I recognize Commissioner Jay with the second of the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6312)|
| 1:45:19| This is all something that will require a roll call. And I want to restate what we're voting on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6319)|
| 1:45:25| back to what I just said earlier. We're voting on the substitute motion. The substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6325)|
| 1:45:29| is to add back in the rural areas into this proposal. So if you, if this passes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6329)|
| 1:45:38| then this resets back. This counts as first reading on it with the rule back added in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6338)|
| 1:45:44| Hope that's clear, madam. And if it doesn't, then we're back to the original resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6344)|
| 1:45:50| Madam Clerk, you ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6350)|
| 1:45:52| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6352)|
| 1:45:53| May I just address, in this reading, there's also a change in the slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6353)|
| 1:45:58| So where are we going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6358)|
| 1:45:59| Ma'am, if you could please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6359)|
| 1:46:01| I'm sorry, Corinne Rivetti, 6925 Sevierville Pike, Knoxville, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6361)|
| 1:46:08| So I understand in this first reading, there had been also that change from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6368)|
| 1:46:14| originally it was 20, then it was put back to 50. And in the first read, it's at a 20% slope change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6374)|
| 1:46:21| So in this substitute motion, I'm not hearing anything addressing the grading issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6381)|
| 1:46:31| I'll ask, I'll look to Mr. Green. I mean, I look at Mr. Smith for clarification on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6391)|
| 1:46:39| Randy, have you got a question on that or a clarification?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6399)|
| 1:46:41| We had changed the slope. And from my perspective...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6401)|
| 1:46:45| I think it's exactly the same as it was when we passed it. I don't think there's been a change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6405)|
| 1:46:49| between this and the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6409)|
| 1:46:51| We would be leaving that at 20%. And you're only asking for the change in terms of including rural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6411)|
| 1:46:57| in this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6417)|
| 1:46:59| That's the way, that's the only thing I'm changing from what we passed last time to now is the rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6419)|
| 1:47:04| The other...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6424)|
| 1:47:04| Okay, I just wanted clarification on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6424)|
| 1:47:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6427)|
| 1:47:08| Thank you. All right. So once again, if you vote for this, you're voting for the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6428)|
| 1:47:15| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6435)|
| 1:47:16| Commissioner Nystrom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6436)|
| 1:47:18| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6438)|
| 1:47:19| Commissioner Nystrom votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6439)|
| 1:47:23| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6443)|
| 1:47:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6445)|
| 1:47:25| Commissioner Schoonmaker votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6445)|
| 1:47:27| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6447)|
| 1:47:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6449)|
| 1:47:29| Commissioner Anders votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6449)|
| 1:47:31| Commissioner Bessler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6451)|
| 1:47:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6452)|
| 1:47:33| Commissioner Bessler votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6453)|
| 1:47:34| Commissioner Beeler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6454)|
| 1:47:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6456)|
| 1:47:36| Commissioner Beeler votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6456)|
| 1:47:38| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6458)|
| 1:47:39| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6459)|
| 1:47:39| Commissioner Daly votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6459)|
| 1:47:41| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6461)|
| 1:47:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6462)|
| 1:47:43| Commissioner Jay votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6463)|
| 1:47:44| Commissioner Bix is out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6464)|
| 1:47:46| Commissioner Gill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6466)|
| 1:47:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6467)|
| 1:47:48| Commissioner Gill votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6468)|
| 1:47:49| Commissioner Kerringer is out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6469)|
| 1:47:51| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6471)|
| 1:47:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6472)|
| 1:47:53| Commissioner Smith votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6473)|
| 1:47:55| The substitute motion does not pass, so we are now back at the original second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6475)|
| 1:48:12| Is there any additional discussion on the second reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6492)|
| 1:48:15| Otherwise, we will proceed to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6495)|
| 1:48:18| And to clarify, Madam Clerk, that motion on the first one, who was the first and second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6498)|
| 1:48:26| Beeler and Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6506)|
| 1:48:28| That was Beeler and?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6508)|
| 1:48:31| Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6511)|
| 1:48:31| Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6511)|
| 1:48:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6512)|
| 1:48:32| So the motion was made by Beeler and seconded by Daly for the second reading on this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6512)|
| 1:48:38| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6518)|
| 1:48:43| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6523)|

| 1:48:54| Commissioner Beeler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6534)|
| 1:48:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267200127zoning?start=6535)|
