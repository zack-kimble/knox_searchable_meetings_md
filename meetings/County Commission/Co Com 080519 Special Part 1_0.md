| 0:00:41| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=41)|
| 0:00:42| All commissioners are present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=42)|
| 0:00:47| Is our law director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=47)|
| 0:00:53| Are you our law director today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=53)|
| 0:01:05| I don't have a set agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=65)|
| 0:01:08| We have two audits that we have on the agenda for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=68)|
| 0:01:16| Do we want to take both of them at the same time or one at a time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=76)|
| 0:01:22| Does anybody have any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=82)|
| 0:01:22| One at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=82)|
| 0:01:23| I would say so, too, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=83)|
| 0:01:25| One at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=85)|
| 0:01:26| We're going to get confused because they are sort of intertwined, but I'd say one at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=86)|
| 0:01:34| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=94)|
| 0:01:36| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=96)|
| 0:01:37| When the law director gets here, I have a question about the travel audit as a separate entity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=97)|
| 0:01:42| but I really need for the law director to be here to ask that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=102)|
| 0:01:45| There he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=105)|
| 0:01:46| Here he comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=106)|
| 0:01:48| He's looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=108)|
| 0:02:05| My question, Mr. Law Director, is with regards to the travel audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=125)|
| 0:02:09| And I believe it was a question that Commissioner Moore had raised a couple of months ago with regards to action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=129)|
| 0:02:14| that the commission had taken with regards to the travel audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=134)|
| 0:02:17| The commission had appropriated and approved funding for the travel allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=137)|
| 0:02:23| And I'm wondering, in light of that, has commission taken action with regards to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=143)|
| 0:02:30| or do we need to hear anything further on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=150)|
| 0:02:35| It may be that we need to hear about it, hear Mr. Wall's presentation, see if there's anything new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=155)|
| 0:02:43| The commission obviously took action in January of this year regarding the mayor's $20,000 account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=163)|
| 0:02:56| which has gone by several different names over the last several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=176)|
| 0:03:00| But the commission took action, and that action was to leave that account as it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=180)|
| 0:03:08| There was a little over $8,000 in that account, if I'm recalling correctly, in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=188)|
| 0:03:17| And the commission voted to leave those funds as they were, which sent a message, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=197)|
| 0:03:30| that it was the intent of the county commission for the mayor to both have those funds as well as to have a vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=210)|
| 0:03:44| All of that was discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=224)|
| 0:03:46| It was discussed at that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=226)|
| 0:03:48| But it may be that Mr. Walls has other information that he wishes to share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=228)|
| 0:03:54| But, you know, as far as I'm concerned, whenever I look at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=234)|
| 0:03:58| and I look at county commission's intent on what that account was all about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=238)|
| 0:04:05| I think commission in January, through the 11 members that we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=245)|
| 0:04:10| expressed what its intent was not only then but perhaps even when the budget was adopted last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=250)|
| 0:04:20| We talked about how the previous mayors had treated a similar account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=260)|
| 0:04:32| And I've had this discussion with Mr. Walls over the last week about how Mr. Shumpert had operated a similar account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=272)|
| 0:04:43| I believe he had an account of $12,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=283)|
| 0:04:47| If he used eight of that or ten of that, the other four or two would be income, and it would be treated as such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=287)|
| 0:04:58| And Mr. Walls has provided that documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=298)|
| 0:05:01| So that appears to have been the practice over the years for that particular item, unless there's something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=301)|
| 0:05:13| There may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=313)|
| 0:05:14| So I guess my follow-up question to that would be we have an item on the agenda with regards to travel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=314)|
| 0:05:19| on whether unlawful acts have occurred and if restitution should be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=319)|
| 0:05:22| Are you ready to issue an opinion on that, or do you want to wait until Mr. Walls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=322)|
| 0:05:28| I'd rather see if there's something new that we haven't heard regarding the travel account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=328)|
| 0:05:43| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=343)|
| 0:05:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=346)|
| 0:05:47| I think it would be helpful for the new commissioners to, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=347)|
| 0:05:53| be told about where these accounts were because this administration he had a car, plus he had $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=353)|
| 0:06:02| And, you know, you keep going back saying the other county executives had them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=362)|
| 0:06:05| but then he had a different account for $50,000 that he could buy tables| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=365)|
| 0:06:10| and whatever he wanted to out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=370)|
| 0:06:13| So there are several different accounts that the administration has that the previous administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=373)|
| 0:06:22| executives did not have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=382)|
| 0:06:24| You know, Mr. Schemper may have had $12,000, but this mayor had $70,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=384)|
| 0:06:28| So I think it's for the new commissioners, instead of acting like it's all in one pot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=388)|
| 0:06:33| the other county executives had it is kind of misleading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=393)|
| 0:06:39| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=399)|
| 0:06:40| Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=400)|
| 0:06:41| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=401)|
| 0:06:42| Is that accurate to say that this mayor had $70,000 in accounts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=402)|
| 0:06:46| He's got one account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=406)|
| 0:06:47| He had a PCAR account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=407)|
| 0:06:48| No, no, outside of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=408)|
| 0:06:50| It went under grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=410)|
| 0:06:52| And under the grants he had $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=412)|
| 0:06:56| And then plus he got the $20,000 in his check every two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=416)|
| 0:07:01| Now, Dwight, I mean, you may fill us in on that, but I think it's helpful for the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=421)|
| 0:07:07| Just to be analogous on your analogy here, the commission has a discretionary account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=427)|
| 0:07:14| and that is funded at $114,000 per year, and the mayor's is funded at $50,000 per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=434)|
| 0:07:20| And I think those two are most closely resemble each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=440)|
| 0:07:23| And I think what Commissioner Moore is bringing in is something that is not germane to this debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=443)|
| 0:07:29| Well, we are going to start on the proceedings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=449)|
| 0:07:31| I think I hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=451)|
| 0:07:33| We're going to do each one separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=453)|
| 0:07:37| And we'll have time for questions and answers, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=457)|
| 0:07:41| I'm going to call on Mr. Walls to give a summary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=461)|
| 0:07:45| I'm not going to interrupt him until after the summary is completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=465)|
| 0:07:50| Then we can have our question and answer period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=470)|
| 0:07:54| Mr. Walls, name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=474)|
| 0:07:57| Richard Walls, Room 319, City County Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=477)|
| 0:08:00| I'm the Knox County Auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=480)|
| 0:08:03| I'd like to begin today by thanking Mr. Walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=483)|
| 0:08:07| Hold on one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=487)|
| 0:08:09| Yeah, we're going to swear everybody in today who's going to speak before this body in this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=489)|
| 0:08:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=497)|
| 0:08:18| We'll start with you, Mr. Walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=498)|
| 0:08:20| If you'll raise your right hand, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=500)|
| 0:08:21| No, we'll get them in turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=501)|
| 0:08:24| All right, Mr. Walls, do you swear or affirm that through your testimony here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=504)|
| 0:08:28| you will tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=508)|
| 0:08:32| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=512)|
| 0:08:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=513)|
| 0:08:36| I'd like to begin today by saying a word of thanks to my staff, Wanda and Shane, my interns, Curtis and Jonathan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=516)|
| 0:08:45| the state comptroller's office, the law department, and the county commission that have helped during this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=525)|
| 0:08:53| It's been a long road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=533)|
| 0:08:55| However, it was important that we were accurate and thorough in our work and the final product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=535)|
| 0:09:02| Okay, what we have given you is a notebook, and it's organized in four sections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=542)|
| 0:09:09| The first two sections are summaries of the allowance report and the PCARD reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=549)|
| 0:09:16| The last two sections are actual full-length versions of both reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=556)|
| 0:09:23| What we're going to focus on today are the summary sections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=563)|
| 0:09:27| and what you'll see on the front of each section is a flow chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=567)|
| 0:09:31| We did it this way in order to be brief, allow time for discussion and questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=571)|
| 0:09:39| and we chose this method to simplify our findings and to expedite today's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=579)|
| 0:09:45| Okay, please go ahead and turn to the first flow chart behind the allowance summary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=585)|
| 0:09:52| and I'll explain to you how the flow chart works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=592)|
| 0:09:57| Okay, in both cases, in the allowance report and the PCARD reports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=597)|
| 0:10:05| we had laws and regulations, policies and procedures that are meant to control the day-to-day operations of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=605)|
| 0:10:12| This is what is represented in column A, what should exist, how things should have happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=612)|
| 0:10:21| Okay, column B represents what does exist or simply how things were done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=621)|
| 0:10:28| As you might expect, when things are not done the way they're supposed to be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=628)|
| 0:10:33| as represented in column A, this results in an issue and a finding in our report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=633)|
| 0:10:40| Okay, column C contains exhibits that illustrates documents that help explain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=640)|
| 0:10:48| or support the issues and findings in our report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=648)|
| 0:10:52| Okay, also today through our presentation, we may have some specialized accounting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=652)|
| 0:10:57| or auditing terms that you may not be familiar with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=657)|
| 0:11:02| and what we'll do at that time is to explain these to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=662)|
| 0:11:07| Okay, let's go ahead and start with the allowance summary flow chart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=667)|
| 0:11:12| and we'll first proceed down column A, what should exist, and then move to column B, what does exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=672)|
| 0:11:19| Okay, row one, column A, salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=679)|
| 0:11:22| Okay, after someone is elected or hired, their salary is set according to Knox County's compensation plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=682)|
| 0:11:30| or in the mayor's case, approved by the county commission according to the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=690)|
| 0:11:35| Under the compensation plan, each employee has a specific grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=695)|
| 0:11:39| and step with an associated salary amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=699)|
| 0:11:43| Okay, let's move down to row two, column A, budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=703)|
| 0:11:47| The next step is when each employee's salary is set forth in the county budget according to the Knox County Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=707)|
| 0:11:54| section 2-553.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=714)|
| 0:11:57| So in each budget, there's actually a listing of each person's salary that is to be paid during that year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=717)|
| 0:12:06| Okay, row three, column A, we have payroll procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=726)|
| 0:12:11| When you have changes in salary or compensation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=731)|
| 0:12:14| this is communicated to the payroll department through a payroll authorization change form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=734)|
| 0:12:21| We actually put an example of that at exhibit four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=741)|
| 0:12:25| Okay, row four, column A, general ledger, financial statement accounting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=745)|
| 0:12:32| For those of you who are not familiar with the term general ledger, as I was reminded Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=752)|
| 0:12:39| that's not the man that leads the troops into battle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=759)|
| 0:12:42| That's actually an accounting term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=762)|
| 0:12:45| And the general ledger is the main accounting record where transactions are posted to the accounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=765)|
| 0:12:53| The collection of accounts is then summarized into financial statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=773)|
| 0:12:58| Each account is the unit to record and summarize the accounting transactions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=778)|
| 0:13:03| In other words, the general ledger is a collection of accounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=783)|
| 0:13:07| When summarized is how the financial statements are produced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=787)|
| 0:13:11| Okay, in Knox County's general ledger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=791)|
| 0:13:14| salary transactions are posted to account number 9-1-1-0, full-time regular pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=794)|
| 0:13:23| Okay, let's move on down to row five, column A, IRS regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=803)|
| 0:13:30| This is where the IRS has specific regulations, how salaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=810)|
| 0:13:33| and allowances are to be recorded on W-2s and then reported on your personal tax return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=813)|
| 0:13:42| Okay, here we're going to talk about a few IRS terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=822)|
| 0:13:45| The first is an accountable plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=825)|
| 0:13:49| In an accountable plan, the expense must have a business connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=829)|
| 0:13:54| and also a receipt must be furnished to the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=834)|
| 0:14:00| In this instance, on the accountable plan, since you're accounting for it with receipts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=840)|
| 0:14:07| this does not go on your W-2 form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=847)|
| 0:14:10| Now, on the flip side, you have a non-accountable plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=850)|
| 0:14:14| In this case, the employee does not turn in receipts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=854)|
| 0:14:18| The amount of the allowance is directly reported on their W-2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=858)|
| 0:14:22| and if there's any tax deduction on the person's personal return,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=862)|
| 0:14:28| then they must report that with receipts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=868)|
| 0:14:30| In other words, an accountable plan, you furnish receipts to the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=870)|
| 0:14:35| and it's not reported on your W-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=875)|
| 0:14:38| On the non-accountable plan, the employee maintains the receipts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=878)|
| 0:14:44| and if there's any tax deduction, it's on their personal return| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=884)|
| 0:14:49| and therefore it is on their W-2 form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=889)|
| 0:14:51| Okay, let's go ahead and proceed to column B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=891)|
| 0:14:55| This is actually what did happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=895)|
| 0:14:58| Okay, row one, column B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=898)|
| 0:15:00| Now, this will compare to what should have happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=900)|
| 0:15:03| The mayor and certain staff members were given arbitrary increases by way of classifying them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=903)|
| 0:15:08| as allowances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=908)|
| 0:15:10| This was actually confirmed in writing by the memo that you see at Exhibit 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=910)|
| 0:15:16| We feel these increases or supplements were disguised and were improper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=916)|
| 0:15:22| All of these individuals actually were furnished a county vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=922)|
| 0:15:27| and therefore in addition, Section 2.2 of the Knox County Code indicates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=927)|
| 0:15:33| an official cannot receive a vehicle and an allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=933)|
| 0:15:38| Okay, let's move down to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=938)|
| 0:15:40| Okay, now, just to make sure that everybody, we're all on the same wavelength.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=940)|
| 0:15:44| Okay, that's for an elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=944)|
| 0:15:46| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=946)|
| 0:15:47| Okay, so we only have one elected official in that group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=947)|
| 0:15:50| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=950)|
| 0:15:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=951)|
| 0:15:52| Okay, looking at row two, column B, budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=952)|
| 0:15:56| Salary amounts in the compensation plan were the amounts presented in the budget to county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=956)|
| 0:16:03| The allowance amounts or increases were budgeted in the auto allowance account for Ragsdale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=963)|
| 0:16:09| and Cook, however, they were not budgeted for Arms, Vandevate, or Werner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=969)|
| 0:16:14| And if you care, you can look at Exhibit 8 and see this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=974)|
| 0:16:19| Row three, column B, payroll procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=979)|
| 0:16:23| The proper authorization form was sent to the payroll department for Todd Cook as shown in Exhibit 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=983)|
| 0:16:31| Ragsdale, Arms, Vandevate, and Werner supplements were actually sent to the payroll department by e-mails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=991)|
| 0:16:37| This is shown in Exhibit 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=997)|
| 0:16:41| Okay, moving to row four, column B, general ledger, financial statement accounting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1001)|
| 0:16:48| The supplement transactions or increases were posted to the general ledger account number 9250, auto allowance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1008)|
| 0:16:58| as you can see in Exhibit 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1018)|
| 0:17:00| As noted earlier, salary would have been posted to the general ledger account full-time, regular pay, account 9110.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1020)|
| 0:17:11| Also, there was an adjusting journal entry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1031)|
| 0:17:14| And again, this is an accounting term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1034)|
| 0:17:17| When you make an adjusting entry, that's the mechanism for changing or correcting an account balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1037)|
| 0:17:24| If you look at Exhibit 9, I'm sorry, Exhibit 10, you will find an adjusting journal entry made after we begin our work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1044)|
| 0:17:35| that transfers auto allowances to salary for Arms and Vandevate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1055)|
| 0:17:41| This same type of journal entry was not made for Ragsdale, Werner, or Cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1061)|
| 0:17:48| Okay, moving on to row five, column B, IRS regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1068)|
| 0:17:53| Amounts paid for Cook and Vandevate were properly and timely reported on the annual W-2s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1073)|
| 0:17:59| However, the amounts for Ragsdale, Arms, and Werner were not originally reported on their W-2s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1079)|
| 0:18:06| Later, payroll tax returns and W-2s were amended while our work was going on last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1086)|
| 0:18:13| As we mentioned earlier, under the accountable plan, receipts are required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1093)|
| 0:18:20| Ragsdale partially complied with this requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1100)|
| 0:18:24| In earlier years, as demonstrated in Exhibit 5, Arms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1104)|
| 0:18:28| and Werner did not comply with the receipt requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1108)|
| 0:18:32| That concludes my remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1112)|
| 0:18:35| And does anyone have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1115)|
| 0:18:38| Before you have any questions, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1118)|
| 0:18:46| I don't have any other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| Just a quick question from your column.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| Excuse me, over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1132)|
| 0:18:53| From your column about criteria, what should exist, is that from generally accepted accounting procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1133)|
| 0:19:00| or what is the derivation of the what should exist criteria?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1140)|
| 0:19:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1146)|
| 0:19:07| Those mostly are Knox County policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1147)|
| 0:19:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1150)|
| 0:19:11| As far as the and some are actually the mayor's salary is actually set by the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1151)|
| 0:19:17| The commission approves that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1157)|
| 0:19:20| The budget setting forth salary amounts is actually in the Knox County Code, Section 2-553.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1160)|
| 0:19:30| The others, payroll procedures, is part of Knox County policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1170)|
| 0:19:36| The general ledger financial statement accounting really is accounting policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1176)|
| 0:19:42| and, you know, how generally accepted accounting principles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1182)|
| 0:19:49| And then, of course, the fifth row is IRS regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1189)|
| 0:19:55| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1195)|
| 0:19:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1198)|
| 0:19:59| Mr. Walsh, they're relating this to the travel pay that Tommy Shumpert got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1199)|
| 0:20:04| and it's basically the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1204)|
| 0:20:07| I believe that's the way I interpret it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1207)|
| 0:20:09| I was checking here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1209)|
| 0:20:10| Tommy Shumpert from 1-5-01 to 12-21-01, he spent $11,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1210)|
| 0:20:22| Now, what concerns me is he has this year and he draws different amounts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1222)|
| 0:20:27| and some pay periods he doesn't even draw anything and maybe even for some months he doesn't draw anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1227)|
| 0:20:32| And it looks like he's been turning receipts on his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1232)|
| 0:20:35| Would you say that was correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1235)|
| 0:20:36| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1236)|
| 0:20:37| From what we understand, Mr. Shumpert did turn in receipts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1237)|
| 0:20:41| That's what I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1241)|
| 0:20:42| Different amounts and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1242)|
| 0:20:43| Well, now, I believe that county commission's intent when they voted for a travel allowance was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1243)|
| 0:20:50| for the same thing Mr. Shumpert had to pay his, their expenses on it when they were out of town and traveling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1250)|
| 0:20:56| I believe that's what they voted for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| Now, Mr. Shumpert did not have a P card, did he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1258)|
| 0:21:03| That I'm not sure of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1263)|
| 0:21:05| I don't see anywhere he's used it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1265)|
| 0:21:08| And another thing here on this, I noticed that Mr. Ragsdale, Mayor Ragsdale there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1268)|
| 0:21:15| to begin with he was using this travel allowance and paying things out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1275)|
| 0:21:22| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1282)|
| 0:21:23| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1283)|
| 0:21:25| And then it seemed like the P cards come along and then he realized that he could just charge these things on the P card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1285)|
| 0:21:33| And he's taken approximately $86,000 tax-free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1293)|
| 0:21:38| Now, they did apply, I understand, for amended W-2s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1298)|
| 0:21:42| But he took that money until they were called home tax-free,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1302)|
| 0:21:46| $86,000 that the county commission had voted to give him for travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1306)|
| 0:21:51| That was the intent of county commission, in my opinion, since Mr. Shumpert had to use his four expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1311)|
| 0:22:01| Okay, definitely he was, Ragsdale was turning in receipts early on, but that did cease over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1321)|
| 0:22:09| Did he not take approximately $86,000 of travel pay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1329)|
| 0:22:13| I believe he turned in about $9,000 in receipts out of the 86.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1333)|
| 0:22:18| Out of the 86, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1338)|
| 0:22:19| Well, the rest of it, there was no W-2 as income or anything, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1339)|
| 0:22:23| Not originally, but it was amended later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1343)|
| 0:22:26| When was it amended, the 29th of June?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| I believe it was the late part of June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1348)|
| 0:22:30| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1350)|
| 0:22:31| After they were exposed on June 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1351)|
| 0:22:33| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1353)|
| 0:22:38| There's a couple more things here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1358)|
| 0:22:40| Well, I guess I need to ask these to Mr. Ragsdale or somebody else a little later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1360)|
| 0:22:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1365)|
| 0:22:46| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1366)|
| 0:22:48| I just had a question to make it absolutely clear in my mind what the travel allowance was supposed to be for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1368)|
| 0:22:57| You said earlier that elected officials were not supposed to receive a vehicle and a travel allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1377)|
| 0:23:05| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1385)|
| 0:23:06| Or an auto allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1386)|
| 0:23:07| Or an auto allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1387)|
| 0:23:10| If they received a vehicle, were they to use the auto allowance to pay for gasoline and upkeep of the vehicle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1390)|
| 0:23:18| Or what was the auto allowance actually supposed to be used for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1398)|
| 0:23:22| The auto allowance was actually set up if you did not have a county vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1402)|
| 0:23:27| And there's quite a few people in the county that do have an auto allowance but do not have a county vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1407)|
| 0:23:34| And so your maintenance and fuel and that sort of thing would be budgeted into your budget to cover your expenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1414)|
| 0:23:44| with your county vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1424)|
| 0:23:47| So if you had a county vehicle and you received an auto allowance, what was that money supposed to be used for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1427)|
| 0:23:59| An auto allowance is designed for a person who does not have a county vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1439)|
| 0:24:08| I guess what I'm asking, though, is if you have a county vehicle and you have an auto allowance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1448)|
| 0:24:12| what is that auto allowance supposed to be used for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1452)|
| 0:24:15| You shouldn't have both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1455)|
| 0:24:16| That's what started all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1456)|
| 0:24:20| You should only have a county vehicle or an auto allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1460)|
| 0:24:24| Not both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| Now, if you don't have a county vehicle and you receive the auto allowance, what is that money supposed to be used for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1466)|
| 0:24:33| That would be to cover your expenses for your personal vehicle use in county work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1473)|
| 0:24:39| Now, for instance, my office, we don't have a county vehicle or an auto allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1479)|
| 0:24:45| We, therefore, turn in mileage, actual mileage, and reimbursed at the IRS rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1485)|
| 0:24:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1494)|
| 0:24:57| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1497)|
| 0:24:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1498)|
| 0:24:59| Mr. Wallace, you worked hard on this, and thank you to you and your staff for the many hours you've put into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1499)|
| 0:25:04| On the travel, you have four findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1504)|
| 0:25:07| Of those findings, which did management concur?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1507)|
| 0:25:13| Could you tell us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1513)|
| 0:25:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1526)|
| 0:25:27| Our first finding was salary improperly reported as travel, miscellaneous reimbursement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1527)|
| 0:25:37| We, they more or less did not concur with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1537)|
| 0:25:48| And noncompliance with Knox County Compensation Plan finding two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1548)|
| 0:26:03| We did not concur with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1563)|
| 0:26:08| Improper reporting on the W-2 to the IRS, number three, they concurred with and corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1568)|
| 0:26:18| Number four, payroll procedures they concurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1578)|
| 0:26:27| Do you have anything else that you're going to report on the travel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1587)|
| 0:26:30| No, but I can answer any more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1590)|
| 0:26:34| Mr. Wallace, what's the procedure if you do have a car?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1594)|
| 0:26:37| How do they pay for the gas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| What account does that come out of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1599)|
| 0:26:43| Some actually have pilot cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1603)|
| 0:26:48| Then some gas is charged on P cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1608)|
| 0:26:52| Is that the proper procedure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1612)|
| 0:26:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1613)|
| 0:26:55| Some gas is at the service center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1615)|
| 0:26:57| Some gas can be obtained at the service center also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1617)|
| 0:27:02| Do you have another question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1622)|
| 0:27:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1623)|
| 0:27:04| Mr. Wallace, going back to Tommy Shumpert, out of the payroll department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1624)|
| 0:27:09| the $12,000 that he got was listed as travel pay, not auto allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1629)|
| 0:27:19| Now, that's how it was recorded in the payroll, yes, as travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1639)|
| 0:27:24| Mayor Ragsdale was reported as auto allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1647)|
| 0:27:28| On the general ledger, it was recorded in auto allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1648)|
| 0:27:33| On the payroll, it was recorded as miscellaneous reimbursement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1653)|
| 0:27:37| I just want to find that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1657)|
| 0:27:42| I believe you said in your report here that any elected official that got an auto allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1662)|
| 0:27:48| Now, that's like commission here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| We're not furnished a car, so we get an auto allowance of $300 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1671)|
| 0:27:57| That applies to all elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1677)|
| 0:27:58| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1680)|
| 0:28:03| You would have to say that this $20,000 is way out of line when you're getting a vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1683)|
| 0:28:09| Would that not be correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1689)|
| 0:28:11| Now, if it's an auto allowance, yes, it would be out of line, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1691)|
| 0:28:15| You know, they said it was an auto allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1695)|
| 0:28:17| I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1697)|
| 0:28:23| Commissioner Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1703)|
| 0:28:24| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1704)|
| 0:28:27| Richard, who authorized the purchase of a vehicle with an auto allowance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1707)|
| 0:28:33| Who would have had to sign off on getting a vehicle if you already had an auto allowance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1713)|
| 0:28:41| That would be a good question for the mayor's office and the finance department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1721)|
| 0:28:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1726)|
| 0:28:49| Let's assume that it came from that office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1729)|
| 0:28:55| Who should have caught that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1735)|
| 0:28:57| I mean, obviously, we're supposed to have checks and balances in all groups of an organization of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1737)|
| 0:29:04| So who should have caught that, that that was against the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1744)|
| 0:29:09| that was against the rules of the commission, against the rules of county government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1749)|
| 0:29:13| How should that have been caught?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1753)|
| 0:29:16| I can't tell you exactly how it should have been caught.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| I can tell you how it was caught.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1759)|
| 0:29:21| And while we were reviewing the budget last year, we noticed auto allowances being paid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1761)|
| 0:29:29| so we asked for a listing of who was getting the auto allowances and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1769)|
| 0:29:35| started discovering people that also had vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1775)|
| 0:29:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| Commissioner Howman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1783)|
| 0:29:44| Is it appropriate now for me to ask a question of Mr. Troyer, or should we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1784)|
| 0:29:50| I'm looking to you for guidance, sir, on how you want me to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1790)|
| 0:29:53| I'm going to take them one at a time, one person at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1793)|
| 0:29:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1797)|
| 0:29:58| So, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1798)|
| 0:29:59| I'll wait until after they've talked to Mr. Walsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1799)|
| 0:30:03| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| What is the difference between an auto allowance and a travel allowance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1805)|
| 0:30:09| And what is the travel allowance supposed to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1809)|
| 0:30:12| And what was the amount of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1812)|
| 0:30:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1818)|
| 0:30:19| It's probably a difference in terminology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1819)|
| 0:30:23| On the payroll, we ran into two different terms as far as deductions on checks or additions to checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1823)|
| 0:30:33| The first was miscellaneous reimbursement, which we found were not reported on W-2s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1833)|
| 0:30:40| The second we found was travel, and we found that this amount would be reported on a W-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1840)|
| 0:30:47| But both amounts were posted to the auto allowance on the general ledger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1847)|
| 0:30:53| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1853)|
| 0:30:55| So in the budget, there is not a line for travel allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1855)|
| 0:30:58| I mean, auto allowance and travel allowance really are the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1858)|
| 0:31:02| Well, I don't know that they're the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| There's only one account on the general ledger, and it's auto allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1864)|
| 0:31:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1868)|
| 0:31:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1869)|
| 0:31:14| Seeing no other likes, thank you, Mr. Wiles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| I'd like to call the mayor, Mike Ragsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1877)|
| 0:31:29| Mr. Mayor, raise your right hand, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| Do you swear or affirm that through your testimony here today you'll tell the truth, the whole truth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1891)|
| 0:31:35| and nothing but the truth, so help you God?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| I will, and I'm delighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1897)|
| 0:31:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1898)|
| 0:31:41| I'd like to respond, if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| I didn't see any likes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1903)|
| 0:31:44| I was going to say, well, no one has anything to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| I've got something I'd like to say, if I might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1906)|
| 0:31:50| What you've heard has been a misrepresentation, in my mind, of what occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1910)|
| 0:31:55| Let's be very clear about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| Crystal clear, in fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| Did Dwight Kessel have an expense allowance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1919)|
| 0:32:02| Without question, he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| Did he have a county car also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1924)|
| 0:32:06| Without question, he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1926)|
| 0:32:08| Did Tommy Shumpert have an expense allowance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1928)|
| 0:32:11| Certainly, he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1931)|
| 0:32:13| Did he also have a county car?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1933)|
| 0:32:14| Without question, he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1934)|
| 0:32:17| Gentlemen, this has been going on for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| You voted on it, those of you who are here, in several budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1939)|
| 0:32:22| Your predecessors voted on it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1942)|
| 0:32:25| Let's make no mistake about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1945)|
| 0:32:26| A majority of commissioners discussed this issue, as the law director mentioned, in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1946)|
| 0:32:31| And it was voted for again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1951)|
| 0:32:34| That's where we find ourselves here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1954)|
| 0:32:36| Now, in terms of the appropriate jargon that was used, there's been some errors there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1956)|
| 0:32:42| But in terms of what's happened, there's been no errors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| This has been the same thing that has been going on for over a decade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1965)|
| 0:32:49| In fact, probably multiple decades in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1969)|
| 0:32:52| The way it was presented is not the way it's actually been used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1972)|
| 0:32:55| Has everything been reported to the IRS?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1975)|
| 0:32:58| Without question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1978)|
| 0:33:00| And I'll be delighted to respond to any questions that any of you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1980)|
| 0:33:06| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1986)|
| 0:33:09| Mayor, there's nobody denying that Tommy Shumpert or Dwight Kessel did not get in a car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1989)|
| 0:33:17| And this $12,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=1997)|
| 0:33:20| But they used it to pay expenses, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2000)|
| 0:33:23| Your $20,000 a year, you only used $9,000 of all the years you've been in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2003)|
| 0:33:30| And you used the P card to pay your expenses with, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2010)|
| 0:33:33| Now, there is a difference there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| Sir, you're completely incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2015)|
| 0:33:36| Oh, I am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2016)|
| 0:33:37| Yes, completely incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| Would you like for me to explain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| Yes, I'd like for you to explain how you spent $9,000 out of the travel allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2021)|
| 0:33:45| I spent many more thousand dollars than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| But I claimed it as a personal deduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| If you'd like for Mr. Troyer to explain how this process works, he's the person you'll be delighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2029)|
| 0:33:54| I discussed it with him completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2034)|
| 0:33:56| My donations to charities and other things out of this account have been many more thousand than nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2036)|
| 0:34:02| Wait a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2042)|
| 0:34:03| Let me finish, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2043)|
| 0:34:04| Many more thousand than nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2044)|
| 0:34:06| There are two ways you can handle this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2046)|
| 0:34:07| I chose to handle it one way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| They chose to handle it another way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| Both are legal, completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2051)|
| 0:34:14| And what you're saying is this $20,000, you gave it to charities like your other $50,000 in your discretionary funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2054)|
| 0:34:23| Is that correct, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2063)|
| 0:34:24| I deducted it for expenses associated with the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| Now, let's talk about the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| Wait just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| No, let me finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2070)|
| 0:34:31| You asked me a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2071)|
| 0:34:32| What you were talking about is the other $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2072)|
| 0:34:35| Where did that go last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2075)|
| 0:34:36| Let me give you a couple of examples of where it did go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| We had an opportunity after the budget was passed for a grant at Beaumont Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2079)|
| 0:34:45| We had two people who stepped up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2085)|
| 0:34:47| It was a $30,000 plus grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2087)|
| 0:34:49| I think it was $36,000 to the best I can recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| We raised $24,000 from two foundations, but we were $12,000 short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2092)|
| 0:34:57| $12,000 of the $50,000 went to Ed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2097)|
| 0:35:00| Many of you came to see me about projects at Gresham School and a skate park in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2100)|
| 0:35:05| Donations were made to that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2105)|
| 0:35:07| As you look around this room, I don't think I can recall a single district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2107)|
| 0:35:11| where someone didn't get something out of that account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2111)|
| 0:35:15| Could be wrong, but I can't recall a single district that didn't get something out of that account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2115)|
| 0:35:20| Prior to last year, it was more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| It was a lot more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2122)|
| 0:35:23| And we did much more things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| We did field house projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2125)|
| 0:35:26| We did other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2126)|
| 0:35:27| But it's all accounted for and it's all there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2127)|
| 0:35:31| Mayor, you say you did this with the $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2131)|
| 0:35:36| You wrote checks for that, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| Out of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2138)|
| 0:35:39| Out of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2139)|
| 0:35:41| Have you produced a check for this $20,000 where you wrote some checks to these people out of this $20,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2141)|
| 0:35:46| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| Are they available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2148)|
| 0:35:49| They're available at the IRS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| The IRS?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2151)|
| 0:35:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| Why is it available at the IRS, sir, when you didn't even report it on your W-2 form?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2154)|
| 0:35:58| It is reported on my W-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| When, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2160)|
| 0:36:01| June the 29th of 07.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2161)|
| 0:36:03| Mr. Pinkston, let's be very clear about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2163)|
| 0:36:05| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2165)|
| 0:36:06| Let's be very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2166)|
| 0:36:07| I'm trying to be very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2167)|
| 0:36:08| No, you're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2168)|
| 0:36:09| We all know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2169)|
| 0:36:10| One at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2170)|
| 0:36:11| We all know the path you're going down and we all know what it's about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| We all know your intentions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2173)|
| 0:36:14| We all know what's behind your little motives and your games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2174)|
| 0:36:17| And I'm not playing them anymore with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2177)|
| 0:36:19| I'll respond to questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2179)|
| 0:36:20| But this was voted on the last time in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2180)|
| 0:36:23| It was voted on many more times before that with other county executives and mayors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2183)|
| 0:36:28| We know what you're up to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2188)|
| 0:36:29| You're not fooling anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2189)|
| 0:36:32| Well, I must be fooling myself because the only intent I have, sir, if you've done the county wrong, the citizens of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2192)|
| 0:36:38| I think you need to pay this money back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| Now, it's evident that you turned in receipts for approximately $9,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2200)|
| 0:36:46| But weren't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2206)|
| 0:36:47| Were the receipts for the other or were the checks been wrote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| Now, you say you reported to the IRS, but you reported to them as income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2209)|
| 0:36:53| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2213)|
| 0:36:54| I took the deduction, sir, when I reported it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2214)|
| 0:36:58| But still, the money went to your pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2220)|
| 0:37:01| You're not showing me a check that you wrote for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| If you'd like to come upstairs, I'll be delighted to show you a lot of checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2223)|
| 0:37:05| I would appreciate it if you'd send somebody upstairs to get them, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2225)|
| 0:37:08| No, just you and me because they're public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| They're not public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2230)|
| 0:37:11| But let's be clear, Mr. Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2231)|
| 0:37:12| They're not public record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2232)|
| 0:37:13| You can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2233)|
| 0:37:14| Let's be clear, Mr. Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2234)|
| 0:37:15| They're not public record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2235)|
| 0:37:16| Any of Knox County's money that you wrote the checks for is not public record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| No, no, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2238)|
| 0:37:19| That's not what you're – that's not – you didn't listen, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2239)|
| 0:37:20| What I'm telling you is the checks I write for my personal account are not public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2240)|
| 0:37:24| But let's be very clear about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2244)|
| 0:37:25| No, but you said they're your personal account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2247)|
| 0:37:28| I take the money and then I write checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2248)|
| 0:37:30| But let's be very clear about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| Mr. Vandivate used this term a couple of months ago with you, and I think it's very appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2252)|
| 0:37:36| You can't have it both ways, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| When you look at your wife with the Knox County Sheriff's Department, she received illegal overtime pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2258)|
| 0:37:43| You didn't seem to want to question that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| You didn't seem to want to deal into that, Mr. Pinkston, because you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2265)|
| 0:37:48| That hits a little too close to home for you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| Sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2270)|
| 0:37:51| And that – no, I'm going to finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2271)|
| 0:37:52| Okay, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2272)|
| 0:37:53| No, you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2273)|
| 0:37:54| On a border, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2274)|
| 0:37:55| And –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2275)|
| 0:37:56| Let him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2276)|
| 0:37:57| One at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2277)|
| 0:37:58| You want to come up here and question my integrity about – I've never been convicted of a crime between the two of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2278)|
| 0:38:04| There's only one of us that's been convicted of a crime, and that's you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2287)|
| 0:38:08| I'm not on trial for perjury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2288)|
| 0:38:10| Mike, we're not getting into personal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| Mayor, Mr. Mayor, I want you to show me where my wife received illegal overtime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2292)|
| 0:38:18| We'll be delighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2298)|
| 0:38:19| You've got your accountant right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2299)|
| 0:38:20| Yeah, we've asked you several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2300)|
| 0:38:22| We're not talking about your wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2302)|
| 0:38:24| We're talking about –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2304)|
| 0:38:25| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2305)|
| 0:38:26| Mr. Chairman, I have to interrupt everyone here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2306)|
| 0:38:29| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2309)|
| 0:38:30| This is how this always ends up, with someone saying that we did something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| We stick it to –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| But right now, we need to discuss what we've got before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2316)|
| 0:38:40| And then, at a later date, if we need to discuss what the commission has done, we need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2320)|
| 0:38:45| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| You still have your light on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2328)|
| 0:38:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2331)|
| 0:38:52| I've just got one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2332)|
| 0:38:53| Thank you, Mr. Mayor, for coming today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2333)|
| 0:38:54| I'm delighted to be here, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| Looking at Exhibit 1, one of three, is what it's listed at the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2336)|
| 0:39:01| It's got Mike Arms, Dwight Vandervecht, John Warner, Todd Cook, Cynthia Finch, Larry Franks, and Mark Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2341)|
| 0:39:10| Now, out of those people, who has a drive-home county vehicle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2350)|
| 0:39:17| Could you read the list one more time, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2357)|
| 0:39:18| Mike Arms, Dwight Vandervecht, John Warner, Todd Cook, Cynthia Finch, Larry Franks, and Mark Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2358)|
| 0:39:26| To the best of my knowledge, the first four you read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2366)|
| 0:39:29| Mike Arms, Dwight Vandervecht, John Warner, and Todd Cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2369)|
| 0:39:36| You're saying they have drive-home vehicles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2376)|
| 0:39:38| To the best of my knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2380)|
| 0:39:41| If you look at what is next to it, which I don't know if you have the copy, like Mike Arms is $461.54 per pay period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2381)|
| 0:39:52| If you jump down to Cynthia Finch, the number is $461.54, which is the same as Mike Arms, Dwight Vandervecht, and John Warner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2392)|
| 0:40:09| So all of them being senior directors, why was she receiving the same thing as John Warner, Dwight Vandervecht, and Mike Arms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2409)|
| 0:40:22| when they had county vehicles and she did not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2422)|
| 0:40:25| Not every director will make the same amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2425)|
| 0:40:29| But if you're looking at an auto allowance, and I guess that's what you called it at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2429)|
| 0:40:35| that it would appear that you were giving them each $461.54 for their vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2435)|
| 0:40:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2441)|
| 0:40:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2443)|
| 0:40:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2444)|
| 0:40:47| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2447)|
| 0:40:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2450)|
| 0:40:50| I guess, Mr. Law Director, I would ask you to, now that Mr. Walls has done his report, have you heard anything new?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2450)|
| 0:41:00| I would ask you if you would give us your opinion regarding the travel audit and whether you think illegal or, pardon me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2460)|
| 0:41:08| the resolution says unlawful acts have occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2468)|
| 0:41:12| One thing I haven't heard is, for everyone's benefit, is an explanation of how the account names were changed over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2472)|
| 0:41:26| Mayor, could you address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2486)|
| 0:41:29| Mr. Law Director, and I'll ask Mr. Troyer to help me with this, but to the best of my ability or best of my knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2489)|
| 0:41:34| we changed software systems and didn't have the same accounts as you used to, so it was clustered under auto allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2494)|
| 0:41:41| I don't know how it was classified with Mr. Kussel or Mr. Schompert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2501)|
| 0:41:45| I don't even remember how it was classified when I first started this job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2505)|
| 0:41:49| But that was how it ended up being classified when we went to a new system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2509)|
| 0:41:52| John, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2512)|
| 0:41:54| Yeah, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2514)|
| 0:41:55| I mean, in Mr. Wallace's packet, you've got a memo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2515)|
| 0:41:58| Hey, John, if you would come up and take the mic, you're probably the best one to answer this anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2518)|
| 0:42:05| Please raise your right hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2525)|
| 0:42:09| Do you swear or affirm through your testimony here today that you'll tell the truth, the whole truth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2529)|
| 0:42:13| and nothing but the truth, so help you God?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2533)|
| 0:42:15| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2535)|
| 0:42:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2536)|
| 0:42:17| Okay, take the commission through the different changes to how this account was labeled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2537)|
| 0:42:25| When I look back at Mr. Schompert's records for some history of how this has been treated over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2545)|
| 0:42:32| I see there's a travel item and I see there's a miscellaneous reimbursement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2552)|
| 0:42:37| I see that he had some receipts and then for the dollars that remained, that was converted to income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2557)|
| 0:42:49| How did it start in 2002 under Mayor Ragsdale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2569)|
| 0:42:57| Okay, just for a bit of history, this particular, we can just start with just the mayor's amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2577)|
| 0:43:05| And it's going under several different names, and that includes an expense allowance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2585)|
| 0:43:09| expense reimbursement, travel allowance, auto allowance, miscellaneous expense reimbursement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2589)|
| 0:43:16| and miscellaneous reimbursement and miscellaneous expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2596)|
| 0:43:19| So it's had a variety of names, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2599)|
| 0:43:22| I think what's most relevant, Mr. Vanovate wrote a letter to the commission in May of 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2602)|
| 0:43:29| and I think it's relevant here today that it was just part of their salary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2609)|
| 0:43:35| and I think that's the best description of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2615)|
| 0:43:41| Let's exhibit one of three to the travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2621)|
| 0:43:55| Why did the, and I've seen the response of the administration to the travel audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2635)|
| 0:44:07| for the commissioners here, why this account, why the label changed over the years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2647)|
| 0:44:16| Most recently, and the most recent changes, we've tried to be the best description we can now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2656)|
| 0:44:21| but we did, as the mayor said, change software.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2661)|
| 0:44:25| What we try to do is have fewer categories and broader descriptions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2665)|
| 0:44:31| and in the course of changing through software systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2671)|
| 0:44:35| that that description as an auto allowance was used more broadly than it should have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2675)|
| 0:44:42| We should have taken out the special case and said, hey, wait, this is an expense allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2682)|
| 0:44:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2687)|
| 0:44:48| When I look at it in a number of ways, I see your fingerprints all over this account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2688)|
| 0:44:58| What I want to know from you is whether you have treated this account differently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2698)|
| 0:45:05| than it was treated for Tommy Shumpert as county executive, as county mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2705)|
| 0:45:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2712)|
| 0:45:13| Let's talk about the IRS allows two different methodologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2713)|
| 0:45:16| There's a document, one that you would document and one that you don't document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2716)|
| 0:45:22| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| The mayor has changed from the documentation plan to the non-documentation plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2724)|
| 0:45:29| which was different than Mr. Shumpert or Mr. Kessel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2729)|
| 0:45:33| but I think, you know, that's really between the mayor and the IRS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2733)|
| 0:45:37| The mayor started out with documentation, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2737)|
| 0:45:40| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2740)|
| 0:45:41| So it started out exactly the same way as Tommy Shumpert's ended, with documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2741)|
| 0:45:52| Excuse me while I turn off my phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2752)|
| 0:45:55| But, yes, that is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| That's what I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| Now, what we do have is that in the end, the mayor has reported all income to the IRS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2759)|
| 0:46:06| and we have amended all W-2s, and we have gotten response back from the IRS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2766)|
| 0:46:12| that our reporting has been acceptable and the changes were accepted by the IRS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2772)|
| 0:46:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2777)|
| 0:46:19| Why was this changed from an accountable plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2779)|
| 0:46:23| Is that what it was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2783)|
| 0:46:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2784)|
| 0:46:25| It's an accountable plan to a non-accountable plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2785)|
| 0:46:26| Why was it changed from an accountable to a non-accountable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2786)|
| 0:46:30| Accountable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2790)|
| 0:46:31| Accountable to a non-accountable, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| Or a documented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2793)|
| 0:46:34| One of the reasons was this, because people were coming and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2794)|
| 0:46:37| well, you gave money to this charity, but you didn't give it to my charity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2797)|
| 0:46:40| You sent flowers to John's grandmother's funeral,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2800)|
| 0:46:44| but you didn't send them to my grandmother's funeral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2804)|
| 0:46:46| I felt like it was just a better way of handling it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2806)|
| 0:46:48| But I checked with Mr. Troyer to make certain that we were in complete compliance before I did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2808)|
| 0:46:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2812)|
| 0:46:57| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2817)|
| 0:46:58| So I think, you know, just from a budgetary standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2818)|
| 0:47:02| I think that that's the most relevant, and that's what we should be talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2822)|
| 0:47:07| I think that this mayor is similar to Mr. Shumpert and Mr. Kessel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2827)|
| 0:47:13| and they need to be treated the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2833)|
| 0:47:17| Well, and I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2837)|
| 0:47:20| But what wasn't explained and what may have led us to this point was how this account was labeled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2840)|
| 0:47:27| and how it was changed over the last several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2847)|
| 0:47:31| When I look at this audit and these accounts, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2851)|
| 0:47:38| I don't see that it was used, ultimately used, in an improper way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2858)|
| 0:47:46| And to come to that conclusion, I also look and see what commission's intent was when they passed the last budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2866)|
| 0:47:52| And I think evidence of that was what occurred at the January meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2872)|
| 0:47:57| There was a resolution brought before the Kentnox County Commission to take the remainder of that $20,000 account away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2877)|
| 0:48:07| And I believe it was brought by Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2887)|
| 0:48:12| It received four votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2892)|
| 0:48:17| I believe that indicates an expression of the intent of this commission when it passed the budget last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2897)|
| 0:48:25| and its intent in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2905)|
| 0:48:27| So I don't know how anyone could sit here and say that this was illegal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2907)|
| 0:48:39| that the mayor's treatment of that account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2919)|
| 0:48:43| which was very similar to the treatment by the past two county executives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2923)|
| 0:48:51| both of whom I've had the privilege of advising over the last 18 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2931)|
| 0:48:57| Never about this, but how it was treated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2937)|
| 0:49:03| So there's my answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2943)|
| 0:49:06| Commissioner Lupo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2946)|
| 0:49:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2948)|
| 0:49:09| John, you said that there was two procedures that the IRS allows to treat this type of account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2949)|
| 0:49:18| Does the county charter or county policy allow for this account to be used that way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2958)|
| 0:49:27| Yeah, I think there's no prohibition to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2967)|
| 0:49:30| You know, this is really between the mayor and the IRS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2970)|
| 0:49:33| and the IRS allows the two different plans and the mayor chooses one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2973)|
| 0:49:38| But do you see how, like Commissioner Pinkston brings up the fact that when it got labeled as travel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2978)|
| 0:49:48| or auto allowance when he already has a vehicle, how that has created this, if nothing else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2988)|
| 0:49:56| let's say misunderstanding of what that money is and what that money is intended for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=2996)|
| 0:50:03| Yes, I agree 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3003)|
| 0:50:05| I think you're exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3005)|
| 0:50:07| My understanding is that when we change software systems, we put it under a broad category| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3007)|
| 0:50:11| and we should have had a more narrow category for just the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3011)|
| 0:50:14| And, yes, I think that was a source of much of this misunderstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3014)|
| 0:50:19| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3019)|
| 0:50:20| But, again, in your professional opinion, and you are under oath,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3020)|
| 0:50:25| you feel that this mayor has treated this account the way the previous mayors have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3025)|
| 0:50:36| or their county executives at the time and followed not only the IRS but county policy and procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3036)|
| 0:50:43| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3043)|
| 0:50:44| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3044)|
| 0:50:45| The mayor has opted under two different IRS allowances, and he's made one choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3045)|
| 0:50:52| He changed during his term, and he's made a different choice now, and he's complete with the IRS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3052)|
| 0:50:59| And how about with the other employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3059)|
| 0:51:04| There were several corrected W-2s for the other employees, and they've all been corrected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3064)|
| 0:51:09| and they've all 100% reported to the IRS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3069)|
| 0:51:17| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3077)|
| 0:51:20| I still want to get the terminology straight since there's so many of these being floated around right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3080)|
| 0:51:26| There's a $50,000 fund that could be called a discretionary fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3086)|
| 0:51:33| where the money is pretty much to be used as the mayor sees fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3093)|
| 0:51:37| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3097)|
| 0:51:38| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3098)|
| 0:51:39| And that's different than this, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3099)|
| 0:51:41| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3101)|
| 0:51:42| And that's the one when you were talking about some of the charities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3102)|
| 0:51:45| That was coming out of that $50,000 discretionary fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3105)|
| 0:51:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3108)|
| 0:51:49| Then we have this $20,000 fund that on the general ledger is the account 9250,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3109)|
| 0:51:56| and that's called the auto allowance, but sometimes we call that the travel allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3116)|
| 0:52:00| That's the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3120)|
| 0:52:02| And I think the best description of that is an expense allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3122)|
| 0:52:06| Okay, that was my next question because I'm looking at Page 1 of Exhibit 1, Page 1 of 3 of Exhibit 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3126)|
| 0:52:14| They talk up here about the salary supplements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3134)|
| 0:52:20| Now, are the salary supplements the same thing as the vehicle allowance or travel allowance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3140)|
| 0:52:25| Was that on the general ledger accounted for by the same accounting number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3145)|
| 0:52:29| Very, very similar, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3149)|
| 0:52:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3151)|
| 0:52:32| Well, just to get back in, are the salary supplements the same thing as the travel allowance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3152)|
| 0:52:39| I think that's the best description, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| It's just a different way to describe the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3161)|
| 0:52:44| Different words of describing the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| So what we're really saying then is that the auto allowance isn't an auto allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3166)|
| 0:52:50| It's a salary supplement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3170)|
| 0:52:51| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3171)|
| 0:52:54| Because I wasn't here when we had the budget hearings on these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3174)|
| 0:52:57| Was this approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3177)|
| 0:52:59| I could ask this of any of the commissioners, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3179)|
| 0:53:01| Was this approved as a salary supplement or was it called an auto allowance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3181)|
| 0:53:06| Or how was that accounted for in the last budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3186)|
| 0:53:09| Back in your packet, Mr. Walls has provided a memo from Mr. Vandervate dated May the 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3189)|
| 0:53:18| It was, I think, three weeks later really describing the expense allowance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3198)|
| 0:53:25| and how it would be treated in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3205)|
| 0:53:28| And the commission voted on the budget three weeks later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3208)|
| 0:53:32| And so the commission had full knowledge of this and adopted the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3212)|
| 0:53:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3217)|
| 0:53:38| And that's the letter dated May 24th, 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3218)|
| 0:53:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| I'm not sure the explanation was for the really the vehicle allowance or travel allowance was in reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3224)|
| 0:53:49| I'm using those words, realities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3229)|
| 0:53:53| They're just part of the overall compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3233)|
| 0:53:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3235)|
| 0:53:59| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3239)|
| 0:54:03| Maybe I misunderstood you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3243)|
| 0:54:04| Would you go over that again about what you said three weeks later we voted for the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3244)|
| 0:54:08| I'm not sure on the date, but I think it was June the 14th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3248)|
| 0:54:13| But we were talking about when we voted on that budget, it wasn't, this part was not in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3253)|
| 0:54:19| This was in the previous budget, wasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3259)|
| 0:54:24| May the 24th, we were talking about the 06-07 budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3264)|
| 0:54:29| And the proposal for the 07-08 included it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3269)|
| 0:54:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3272)|
| 0:54:33| Same as 06-07.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3273)|
| 0:54:34| We've got a little spin in here, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3274)|
| 0:54:35| You correct me if I'm wrong on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3275)|
| 0:54:38| I think it says they are treated as such for tax purposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3278)|
| 0:54:44| and they are appropriately reflected on end-of-year tax documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3284)|
| 0:54:49| Now, sir, that's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3289)|
| 0:54:51| This is dated May the 24th and they didn't change it and put it on the W-2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3291)|
| 0:54:55| amended W-2 forms to June the 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3295)|
| 0:54:58| Some of the W-2 forms were amended after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3298)|
| 0:55:01| This is why it vandibates there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3301)|
| 0:55:02| Also, the auditor, and I want you to, I want everybody to take into consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3302)|
| 0:55:08| it isn't just our auditor, it's also the state comptroller's auditor that they're sitting here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3308)|
| 0:55:12| They're agreeing that the, let's see here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3312)|
| 0:55:16| reporting of salary as travel and miscellaneous reimbursements is not within the mayor's authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3316)|
| 0:55:24| Would you not agree with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3324)|
| 0:55:26| I disagree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3326)|
| 0:55:27| You disagree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3327)|
| 0:55:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3328)|
| 0:55:29| Now, the law director said this had your fingerprints all over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3329)|
| 0:55:33| You were the one that set this travel allowance up, wasn't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3333)|
| 0:55:36| Auto allowance or travel allowance, whatever you want to call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3336)|
| 0:55:39| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3339)|
| 0:55:40| You're the one that created that journal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3340)|
| 0:55:44| Which journal do you speak of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3344)|
| 0:55:46| Travel allowance or auto allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3346)|
| 0:55:50| You set that journal up for these people to get this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3350)|
| 0:55:53| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| In some instances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3355)|
| 0:55:56| I think that Mr. Wall's documentation will show the source of the direction, the instructions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3356)|
| 0:56:04| You set the journal up according to your boss at the time, John Warner, on May the 24th said you set the journal up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3364)|
| 0:56:14| It was not him, but you set the journal up in the auto allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3374)|
| 0:56:20| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3380)|
| 0:56:22| So as far as executing how people got paid, I mean, that is part of what I'm supposed to do, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3382)|
| 0:56:28| So you arrived at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3388)|
| 0:56:29| Well, you're a CPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3389)|
| 0:56:32| Do you think that it's proper if you were filling out my income tax for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3392)|
| 0:56:38| and this company furnished me a car in an auto allowance or salary reimbursement, not to report that on my W-2s?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3398)|
| 0:56:49| All of these amounts have been reported on W-2s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3409)|
| 0:56:51| Sir, they were reported June the 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3411)|
| 0:56:53| This had gone on for several years, hadn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3413)|
| 0:56:55| So, yes, we did amended returns for many of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3415)|
| 0:56:59| You went back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3419)|
| 0:57:00| I don't know how far you went back, but John Warner and some of these people, and I don't know if they had a car at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3420)|
| 0:57:04| were drawing these travel allowances as far as 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3424)|
| 0:57:08| We've gotten confirmation from the IRS about our reporting and they've confirmed it and accepted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3428)|
| 0:57:14| You're a CPA knowing these people had these cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3434)|
| 0:57:16| Why did you set this up knowing it was illegal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3436)|
| 0:57:20| I think the law director has given an opinion about the legality of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3440)|
| 0:57:26| Well, you don't think they should have paid tax on it, that's what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3446)|
| 0:57:30| I'm not saying maybe the law director is saying they couldn't have gotten the money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3450)|
| 0:57:33| but what you set up was a ledger, a journal where they were not paying income tax on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3453)|
| 0:57:39| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3459)|
| 0:57:43| To begin with, some of these and not all of them, and so we can't be consistent across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3463)|
| 0:57:48| Everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3468)|
| 0:57:49| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3469)|
| 0:57:50| Excuse me, Mr. Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3470)|
| 0:57:51| Commissioner Pinkston, I think he's answered the question the best he's going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3471)|
| 0:57:55| Do you have any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3475)|
| 0:58:01| Some of these were set up just as a piece of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3481)|
| 0:58:03| Some of these were set up as an accountable plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| Our expectation was that they would account for the expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3485)|
| 0:58:08| And later, subsequently, we found out that they would choose the non-accountable plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3488)|
| 0:58:13| and their W-2s were amended appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3493)|
| 0:58:18| John, Section 22C of the Knox County Code is only applicable to the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3498)|
| 0:58:24| The application section for the county mayor is 2.2B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3504)|
| 0:58:28| That allows for an elected official to receive a reimbursement allowance only if they are not assigned a county vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3508)|
| 0:58:37| Do you agree with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3517)|
| 0:58:38| I understand that that's in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3518)|
| 0:58:40| What also is I think Commissioner Briggs brought up, it's this mislabeling of the payments that caused the confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3520)|
| 0:58:49| So I think Commissioner Leuthold brought that up as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3529)|
| 0:58:52| It's the label was more of the problem than anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3532)|
| 0:58:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3537)|
| 0:58:58| The $50,000 now that we brought up, is that an accountable or unaccountable fund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3538)|
| 0:59:03| It's neither.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3543)|
| 0:59:05| $50,000 is just like the commissioners have a discretionary fund where each commissioner has $6,000 to give to whatever cause they choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3545)|
| 0:59:13| And the mayor, which was approved in the budget by the county commission, has $50,000 to do so, to do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3553)|
| 0:59:21| You've heard the mayor say that he gave this $20,000 away to charities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3561)|
| 0:59:25| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3565)|
| 0:59:27| It's his business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3567)|
| 0:59:28| I mean, you said that he gave it away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3568)|
| 0:59:30| It's the mayor's business on a non-accountable plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3570)|
| 0:59:33| He reports his deductions to the IRS and reports it as income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3573)|
| 0:59:38| Why was not that $20,000 just put in with the $50,000 to make a $70,000 discretionary fund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3578)|
| 0:59:44| The $50,000 the county writes the check, the $20,000 the mayor writes the check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3584)|
| 0:59:48| There's a big difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3588)|
| 0:59:50| Commissioner Pinkston, I'm going to go to some others and I will come back to you if you have some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3590)|
| 0:59:56| Commissioner Moore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3596)|
| 1:00:01| I'm looking at Exhibit 8, one of three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3601)|
| 1:00:07| And I don't know how far it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3607)|
| 1:00:09| It's in the first tab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3609)|
| 1:00:20| Seven pages from the end of the first tab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3620)|
| 1:00:28| This is what commission looked at when we passed the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3628)|
| 1:00:34| And if you see down here it says grant donations, $50,000, auto allowance out of account 9250, $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3634)|
| 1:00:51| So I would think if you're looking at that page and you approve this budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3651)|
| 1:00:57| you wouldn't think or I didn't think that this $20,000 was going to someone that had an auto| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3657)|
| 1:01:05| and their gas being furnished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3665)|
| 1:01:11| John, can you tell us, did Mr. Shumpert have a $70,000 expense account?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3671)|
| 1:01:20| I think once again you're confusing the two different accounts and you're combining the two different accounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3680)|
| 1:01:25| I think the $50,000 account that the mayor has that's been approved in the budget by this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3685)|
| 1:01:33| the $50,000 is just like the county commissioner's discretionary fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3693)|
| 1:01:37| but the county commissioners each have $6,000 to spend as they choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3697)|
| 1:01:41| Now, the $20,000 is just like Mr. Kessel and Mr. Shumpert had in just different amounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3701)|
| 1:01:47| Let me make it perfectly clear that whatever county commission gives out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3707)|
| 1:01:53| the public knows exactly what it goes for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3713)|
| 1:01:58| They can go check our records for anything that we do, our travel, our community grants, recipients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3718)|
| 1:02:06| And you're saying that you believe that the mayor ought to have $20,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3726)|
| 1:02:12| that he can give away in secret of taxpayer money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3732)|
| 1:02:16| No, I believe that that's part of and included in his salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3736)|
| 1:02:19| and that none of these commissioners of what they give out of their salary, you should have to report that to the public either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3739)|
| 1:02:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3746)|
| 1:02:27| If you're looking at Exhibit A, one of three, and you were looking to approve this budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3747)|
| 1:02:32| what would you think the auto allowance stood for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3752)|
| 1:02:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3755)|
| 1:02:36| Except you as a county commissioner would know that through history that is a very similar amount as the previous three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3756)|
| 1:02:44| It's the last three years in a row where $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3764)|
| 1:02:46| But what would you think, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3766)|
| 1:02:47| I mean, we're looking at a budget of $600 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3767)|
| 1:02:49| And we just scroll down through this administration's budget and you see an auto allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3769)|
| 1:02:55| My golly, I mean, I could not imagine voting for a budget that someone had a car| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3775)|
| 1:03:04| and then we were going to give them $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3784)|
| 1:03:07| Now, you can sit there and say that we should have known or it's just history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3787)|
| 1:03:13| and this is the way we've always done things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3793)|
| 1:03:16| But I'm telling you as a county commissioner sitting on this board for Knox County taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3796)|
| 1:03:22| that I would have never voted for someone getting $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3802)|
| 1:03:34| So I understand that you disagree with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3814)|
| 1:03:37| I understand that you made a motion to not pay it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3817)|
| 1:03:41| No, the motion was to take the $8,000 in the remaining of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3821)|
| 1:03:47| And what was the result of that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3827)|
| 1:03:49| The vote failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3829)|
| 1:03:50| But it had nothing to do with, you know, I'm not a lawyer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3830)|
| 1:03:54| and I'm not a public prosecutor or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3834)|
| 1:03:59| But what I am for is good government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3839)|
| 1:04:02| And though we all make mistakes, and I'm probably at the head of the list for making mistakes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3842)|
| 1:04:12| but you guys are supposed to set an example for the rest of the 1,300,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3852)|
| 1:04:19| 1,600 county employees that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3859)|
| 1:04:22| And if I'll just use somebody from engineering and say they got to drive home a pickup truck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3862)|
| 1:04:30| and it was somehow that they finagled their way into the budget, a $20,000 car allowance, what would this administration be saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3870)|
| 1:04:41| I mean, my goodness, we've let people go for taking scrap metal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3881)|
| 1:04:47| We've had office holders fire people for less than five gallons of gasoline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3887)|
| 1:04:53| And this mayor is getting almost $800 every two weeks in his paycheck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3893)|
| 1:04:59| And I would say that there's not many county employees that bring home $800 every two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3899)|
| 1:05:09| Now, Commissioner Moore, you need to wrap it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3909)|
| 1:05:11| Now, that's all I need to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3911)|
| 1:05:12| I mean, if it was any other county employee, they would never have got by with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3912)|
| 1:05:17| Commissioner DeFreeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3917)|
| 1:05:19| Okay, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3919)|
| 1:05:23| In row one, when it talks about the salary, the Knox County Charter is supposed to be set, and it has Ragsdale written there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3923)|
| 1:05:34| And then it says an arbitrary salary increase of $8,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3934)|
| 1:05:38| Who approved that increase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3938)|
| 1:05:41| First of all, I don't think it's an arbitrary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3941)|
| 1:05:46| Who approved it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3946)|
| 1:05:47| Now, let's help me out with where you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3947)|
| 1:05:50| Okay, I'm on just the flow chart for the auto travel allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3950)|
| 1:05:57| Number one, row one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3957)|
| 1:06:01| Yeah, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3961)|
| 1:06:04| Make a motion to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3964)|
| 1:06:09| So your question is who approved that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3969)|
| 1:06:12| Who approved an $8,000 arbitrary salary increase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3972)|
| 1:06:17| For?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3977)|
| 1:06:18| Mayor Mike Ragsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3978)|
| 1:06:21| I don't think it was a salary increase at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3981)|
| 1:06:23| I think what we have is we have a bad label for an expense allowance that the mayor has had for four years in a row,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3983)|
| 1:06:32| the same amount, and previous two county executives had in differing amounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3992)|
| 1:06:37| And so I don't think it's arbitrary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3997)|
| 1:06:39| And I think it was all approved by the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=3999)|
| 1:06:42| All right, what about the compensation plan for Arms, Warner, Vanderveet, and Cook?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4002)|
| 1:06:47| I understand where your question is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4007)|
| 1:06:50| And I agree that in most every situation that we would want to abide by the pay and compensation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4010)|
| 1:06:58| I am very much a strong proponent of the pay and compensation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4018)|
| 1:07:03| But the pay and compensation plan does not prevent the mayor or other elected officials from doing something in addition to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4023)|
| 1:07:14| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4034)|
| 1:07:15| And that's exactly what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4035)|
| 1:07:16| Who does something in addition to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4036)|
| 1:07:18| Who selected to give Arms, Warner, and Vanderveet $12,000 more and Cook $4,290 more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4038)|
| 1:07:26| Mr. Cook has been there for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4046)|
| 1:07:29| And Mr. Arms, Warner, and Vanderveet, that was, I understand, I don't want to speak for the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4049)|
| 1:07:35| but I understand that that was the mayor's decision to compensate these three people that were important to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4055)|
| 1:07:42| Is there, is it outlined in our charter how much the county mayor should make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4062)|
| 1:07:48| I think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4068)|
| 1:07:50| So how did an $8,000 increase come about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4070)|
| 1:07:54| I don't think there was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4074)|
| 1:07:55| Isn't that in addition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4075)|
| 1:07:56| Or you're just saying it was a labeling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4076)|
| 1:07:59| I believe that's in the labeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4079)|
| 1:08:01| It's a labeling issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4081)|
| 1:08:03| And what we have is an expense allowance that is consistent with County Executive Kessel, County Executive Schumpert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4083)|
| 1:08:10| And this was the fourth year in a row for this same mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4090)|
| 1:08:12| And so if commissioners say they didn't know, they should have known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4092)|
| 1:08:15| And that's just been a part of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4095)|
| 1:08:20| You know, the $20,000 account that they said that was absorbed into the mayor's personal account, I find that very interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4100)|
| 1:08:28| It's not very transparent, I don't believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4108)|
| 1:08:31| And then the comparison was made, well, nothing is sought from our personal accounts as to what we give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4111)|
| 1:08:37| and what charities we give to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4117)|
| 1:08:39| However, I do believe that that was, if that was truly county money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4119)|
| 1:08:43| and I understand Mr. Mayor's point about certain people not being, their charities not being acknowledged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4123)|
| 1:08:50| or he was giving, selecting ones over the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4130)|
| 1:08:53| But I still find that very questionable that he would have $20,000 of county money that he would slip into his personal account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4133)|
| 1:08:59| and then pay for charities out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4139)|
| 1:09:01| First, there's no slipping into anybody's account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4141)|
| 1:09:04| And second, if the commission were to choose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4144)|
| 1:09:06| each commissioner has $6,000 that's approved in this year's budget, it's also proposed in next year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4146)|
| 1:09:12| The commission has $6,000 apiece to give in their discretionary monies and that we could change the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4152)|
| 1:09:18| But I thought that was very, I thought that was compatible to the $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4158)|
| 1:09:23| Right, I know, but you ask a different question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4163)|
| 1:09:25| We could change the accounting to the IRS, make those non-accountable dollars included on your income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4165)|
| 1:09:32| and then you would have no requirement to make that public reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4172)|
| 1:09:37| You can just make your donations as you see fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4177)|
| 1:09:39| I don't, you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4179)|
| 1:09:40| I really don't even think that would be a good idea for each of us to have $6,000 to slip into our account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4180)|
| 1:09:44| and have unaccountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4184)|
| 1:09:45| I think that would make Knox County, the folks out there, very upset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4185)|
| 1:09:49| I think that's why everybody has questions right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4189)|
| 1:09:52| And, you know, this is like who's, you know, who got something out of the cookie jar right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4192)|
| 1:09:56| And we're all relabeling it and calling it something else besides what everybody suspicions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4196)|
| 1:10:06| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4206)|
| 1:10:11| Yeah, I understand that the, what was labeled as a car allowance, you're saying that was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4211)|
| 1:10:19| that yours was not a salary supplement, that it was expense money, is that what you're saying, Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4219)|
| 1:10:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4226)|
| 1:10:29| When it comes to Cynthia Finch, this $461.54 per pay period, was that an auto allowance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4229)|
| 1:10:38| or was that a salary supplement or was that an expense account?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4238)|
| 1:10:47| And I guess this is for John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4247)|
| 1:10:48| I think if you go back to Mr. Vandervate's memo from May the 24th of 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4248)|
| 1:10:53| I think he describes this as a salary supplement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4253)|
| 1:10:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4257)|
| 1:10:59| All right, so these, so you're saying that her $461.54 was equivalent to John Werner's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4259)|
| 1:11:07| Dwight Vandervate's and Mike Arm's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4267)|
| 1:11:10| It's in the same amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4270)|
| 1:11:11| That's what they were all receiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4271)|
| 1:11:13| That's what I found very confusing when we went through this before because Cynthia did not have a car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4273)|
| 1:11:21| And so I felt like it was appropriate for her to have an auto allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4281)|
| 1:11:25| And it was labeled as an auto allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4285)|
| 1:11:28| But the other three employees were getting the exact same amount, yet they had company vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4288)|
| 1:11:37| Yeah, I think what it comes back to, though, is that once the county commission approves the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4297)|
| 1:11:41| it's under the mayor's discretion to pay his people what he wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4301)|
| 1:11:44| I think that's the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4304)|
| 1:11:45| I think the law director will agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4305)|
| 1:11:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4308)|
| 1:11:49| Well, that's what makes this so confusing is here we have it said auto allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4309)|
| 1:11:55| We have an employee that didn't receive a car that was probably entitled to an auto allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4315)|
| 1:12:00| Then we have three that did have cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4320)|
| 1:12:03| And if the mayor's salary enhancement or whatever, expense money, whatever we want to call it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4323)|
| 1:12:12| if those had just been labeled differently, it wouldn't have been so confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4332)|
| 1:12:16| I agree 100 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4336)|
| 1:12:18| When I looked at this the first time and looking at it now still,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4338)|
| 1:12:23| I looked at it as we've got one person that's entitled to an auto allowance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4343)|
| 1:12:27| and four people that are calling something an auto allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4347)|
| 1:12:30| And that's what made this confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4350)|
| 1:12:33| And it's also what, I mean, it's, I mean, I'm honestly sitting here thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4353)|
| 1:12:41| is this what these accounts really were or were these simple salary enhancements for everyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4361)|
| 1:12:47| And then we just went back after the fact and plugged in numbers to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4367)|
| 1:12:51| plugged in different names to make everything sound good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4371)|
| 1:12:54| And that's what's made this so confusing and that's what's got us where we're here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4374)|
| 1:13:04| So I agree that it has been confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4384)|
| 1:13:06| The labels were confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4386)|
| 1:13:08| The change in software was confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4388)|
| 1:13:10| I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4390)|
| 1:13:11| I mean, the software that, did the software not allow the ability to have multiple lines for different things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4391)|
| 1:13:22| I guess what I'm saying is why, when you change the software,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4402)|
| 1:13:26| did we start lumping what was probably an auto allowance for one person, a salary supplement for three people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4406)|
| 1:13:34| and expense money reimbursement for the mayor, how did that all get lumped together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4414)|
| 1:13:42| Were we using very simple software that didn't allow the different categories or how did this happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4422)|
| 1:13:50| Our intent was to, it was not to confuse but to simplify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4430)|
| 1:13:54| and our intent was to have fewer broader categories to give the office holders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4434)|
| 1:14:00| and that would be all the elected officials, more latitude to be able to use their budget as they chose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4440)|
| 1:14:08| And these should have been pulled out individually and they weren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4448)|
| 1:14:13| So I agree with you, Mr. Commissioner, that was confusing and that made it hard for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4453)|
| 1:14:19| Well, I'll tell you what, like I said, I'm still confused about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4459)|
| 1:14:24| So what my proposal is, and can I make a motion at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4464)|
| 1:14:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4468)|
| 1:14:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4469)|
| 1:14:30| I'm going to propose that we just send this to the law director and let him hash it out using the rule of law to weigh it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4470)|
| 1:14:38| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4478)|
| 1:14:41| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4481)|
| 1:14:42| Yeah, this is going to be a very short question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4482)|
| 1:14:44| I'm sorry I have to come back on these because I was not provided any of these documents until just a few minutes before this started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4484)|
| 1:14:50| So I don't have my questions in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4490)|
| 1:14:55| But it gets back to column B on line five on the very first page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4495)|
| 1:15:01| If these things on the general ledger were the account number was 9250,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4501)|
| 1:15:07| why did some of those kick out of W-2 that was reported and some of them weren't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4507)|
| 1:15:12| It seems like if it were the same accounting number that both of those should happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4512)|
| 1:15:15| I mean, what was the computer or software problem that didn't allow that to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4515)|
| 1:15:20| It seems to me that put the mayor in an embarrassing position that probably shouldn't have happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4520)|
| 1:15:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4525)|
| 1:15:26| And what we've got is we've got different deductions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4526)|
| 1:15:29| And they happen through the payroll system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4529)|
| 1:15:31| It's not necessarily driven by the general ledger system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4531)|
| 1:15:33| The accounting system is driven by the payroll system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4533)|
| 1:15:35| And there's two different deductions, one that is pre-tax and one that is taxable, one that's tax exempt and one that's taxable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4535)|
| 1:15:47| And they weren't consistent between the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4547)|
| 1:15:50| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4550)|
| 1:15:56| Commissioner Pinkston, three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4556)|
| 1:16:01| John, since that 20,000 was discretionary fund for the mayor, what about the one to arms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4561)|
| 1:16:09| the 12,000 to arms and Warner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4569)|
| 1:16:13| And then was that discretionary funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4573)|
| 1:16:15| That's my opinion, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4575)|
| 1:16:17| In other words, they had the discretionary funds, what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4577)|
| 1:16:22| Expense allowance, discretionary funds, probably the best description is an expense allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4582)|
| 1:16:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4588)|
| 1:16:30| Now, on June the 29th, you rolled this over, this fund over into a salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4590)|
| 1:16:40| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4600)|
| 1:16:41| Yeah, I don't remember the date, but, yes, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4601)|
| 1:16:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4604)|
| 1:16:45| We didn't vote on that salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4605)|
| 1:16:47| The budget sets forth the salary of each employee and that wasn't given to us when we voted on this prior budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4607)|
| 1:16:54| So how did you line out and transfer this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4614)|
| 1:16:59| And this is something that we have talked about in previous commission meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4619)|
| 1:17:04| What we have is we have a budgetary proposal and in the budgetary, initial budgetary proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4624)|
| 1:17:09| the amounts were listed in the 200 series or the 9250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4629)|
| 1:17:14| I can't be sure about the detail on that, but I know that they were in the 9200 series.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4634)|
| 1:17:19| Mr. Vandervate since added supplemental information and said, hey, wait a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4639)|
| 1:17:23| this needs to be in the 9100 series because that's what it is, is income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4643)|
| 1:17:27| And that's the way that we reported it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4647)|
| 1:17:29| And so we did change our reporting, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4649)|
| 1:17:32| And that was properly reported to the full commission at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4652)|
| 1:17:35| And it was reported in Mr. Wall's packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4655)|
| 1:17:39| There's another memo from me to the county commission in August talking about exactly the same thing, dated August 18, 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4659)|
| 1:17:50| Well, in other words, what you're saying, you rolled that into their salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4670)|
| 1:17:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4674)|
| 1:17:55| And just like it was disclosed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4675)|
| 1:17:57| Well, the county commission didn't vote on that to be in their salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4677)|
| 1:18:01| Their salary was budget, was set in the budget for us in 06 and 07 and that's what we voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4681)|
| 1:18:08| How did you get this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4688)|
| 1:18:09| How did they get this raised without it being budgeted in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4689)|
| 1:18:13| Now, let's just talk about it and let's just keep this to just because what we've got is just the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4693)|
| 1:18:19| because that's all we have is it's the only one that we're talking about is just the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4699)|
| 1:18:24| And all the other ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4704)|
| 1:18:27| We're talking about the travel allowance, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4707)|
| 1:18:29| The travel allowance applied to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4709)|
| 1:18:31| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4711)|
| 1:18:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4712)|
| 1:18:33| How did these people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4713)|
| 1:18:34| Let's talk about who's getting that now because the expense allowances for many of these people were stopped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4714)|
| 1:18:46| Through this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4726)|
| 1:18:47| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4727)|
| 1:18:48| Through this whole discussion last year, the mayor's was continued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4728)|
| 1:18:52| The mayor's was part of the conversation in June, the adoption of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4732)|
| 1:18:59| The mayor's was part of the conversation in the July commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4739)|
| 1:19:02| The mayor's was part of my August 18th memo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4742)|
| 1:19:05| The mayor's was a part of a commission vote in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4745)|
| 1:19:11| But you're talking about the 07-08 budget in July and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4751)|
| 1:19:16| What I'm saying is in July of 06 the budget set forth the salary of each and one of these employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4756)|
| 1:19:24| And we voted on a figure that we were given that they were making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4764)|
| 1:19:28| They got this $12,000 a year, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4768)|
| 1:19:31| And you rolled it over into their salary June the 29th after it was called that they were getting a travel allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4771)|
| 1:19:38| You said, well, that should have been salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4778)|
| 1:19:40| We didn't vote to give them that $12,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4780)|
| 1:19:46| The county commission, in their budget resolution, adopts the budget on the 100 level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4786)|
| 1:19:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4791)|
| 1:19:52| The 100 level is salaries, benefits, contracted services, supplies and materials, other charges, debt, capital outlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4792)|
| 1:20:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4801)|
| 1:20:02| The mayor has stayed within the allotment of the 100 level series for the salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4802)|
| 1:20:09| And, you know, once the budget is adopted, the commission speaks through their budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4809)|
| 1:20:13| Once the budget is adopted, it's up to the executive branch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4813)|
| 1:20:16| and each elected official to spend their budget as they see fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4816)|
| 1:20:20| The budget is adopted at the line item level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4820)|
| 1:20:26| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4826)|
| 1:20:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4829)|
| 1:20:30| I know that we're not accepting motions now, but I would like to make a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4830)|
| 1:20:35| and that motion would be to accept the travel audit from Mr. Walls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4835)|
| 1:20:40| accept the legal opinion from our law director, and based upon that legal opinion to take no further action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4840)|
| 1:20:47| So at the appropriate time, I'd like to make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4847)|
| 1:20:50| Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4850)|
| 1:20:54| Mr. Troyer, can you define what a salary supplement is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4854)|
| 1:21:01| Additional pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4861)|
| 1:21:06| Is it for something specific or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4866)|
| 1:21:10| I guess I'm just confused because I don't understand why you would have a supplement to your salary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4870)|
| 1:21:17| why you wouldn't just have an increase in your salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4877)|
| 1:21:21| and your salary would just increase while it would be a separate amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4881)|
| 1:21:25| That would have been a much more clear way to do that, but not the only way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4885)|
| 1:21:35| It doesn't make sense, sir, not to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4895)|
| 1:21:38| If you're going to increase someone's salary, you would just increase their salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4898)|
| 1:21:42| You wouldn't give them a salary supplement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4902)|
| 1:21:45| When you go in and get a raise from your boss, he gives you a raise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4905)|
| 1:21:49| and you get a bigger check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4909)|
| 1:21:52| You don't get separate line items for each additional thing in your check unless it is for specific things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4912)|
| 1:22:01| such as a travel allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4921)|
| 1:22:05| It just doesn't make sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4925)|
| 1:22:07| What I'm confused by as well is for it was called a vehicle allowance or called an auto allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4927)|
| 1:22:21| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4941)|
| 1:22:22| For all of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4942)|
| 1:22:23| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4943)|
| 1:22:25| When did that name change occur to a salary supplement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4945)|
| 1:22:31| Mr. Vandervate wrote a memo on May the 24th of 2007 and really called it what it is, a salary supplement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4951)|
| 1:22:39| And I think from that point forward, we referred to it as a salary supplement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4959)|
| 1:22:47| So when did they start receiving the salary supplement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4967)|
| 1:22:55| The best of my memory would be July of 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4975)|
| 1:23:00| And so when the budget was submitted, so...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4980)|
| 1:23:10| It would be July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4990)|
| 1:23:12| Uh-huh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4992)|
| 1:23:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4998)|
| 1:23:19| As I understand it, each of each, Mr. Arms, Mr. Vandervate, Mr. Warner, Miss Finch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=4999)|
| 1:23:24| they have different responsibilities and are paid different levels of salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5004)|
| 1:23:28| So why are they all paid the same dollar figure as a salary supplement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5008)|
| 1:23:35| The mayor thought it would be appropriate and they should get the same amount for an expense allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5015)|
| 1:23:41| So...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5021)|
| 1:23:42| Okay, but now you're calling it an expense allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5022)|
| 1:23:45| So do they all have the same dollar expenses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5025)|
| 1:23:50| Or would each department have different expenses or different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5030)|
| 1:23:53| I mean, as I understand an expense account, especially for different departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5033)|
| 1:24:00| I mean, Cynthia Finch had a whole host of departments that she was responsible for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5040)|
| 1:24:05| So I would think her expenses would be a lot different from Mr. Warner's or Mr. Vandervate's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5045)|
| 1:24:11| And so I guess I'm curious as to why they would have the exact same dollar amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5051)|
| 1:24:17| You know, I can't speak for the mayor on this issue other than...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5057)|
| 1:24:23| Can you answer that for me, Mr. Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5063)|
| 1:24:29| Commissioner, at the beginning of our second term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5069)|
| 1:24:33| we had some people who I wanted to keep as a part of this administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5073)|
| 1:24:37| When I looked at their salaries compared to their counterparts at the cities and other counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5077)|
| 1:24:42| I felt like they were far underpaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5082)|
| 1:24:44| So we discussed what's the best way of doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5084)|
| 1:24:46| And I thought this was the best way at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5086)|
| 1:24:48| Was it probably the most appropriate way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5088)|
| 1:24:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5090)|
| 1:24:51| Again, I would have done something differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5091)|
| 1:24:53| But it's the way we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5093)|
| 1:24:54| I was hoping they would claim expenses about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5094)|
| 1:24:56| When it got to be an issue, then we were, I think, actually requested by county commission to move it over into salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5096)|
| 1:25:03| And we did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5103)|
| 1:25:04| It was a one-year thing for those individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5104)|
| 1:25:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5113)|
| 1:25:14| Can I ask one more question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5114)|
| 1:25:15| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5115)|
| 1:25:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5116)|
| 1:25:17| Now, as I understand it, Mr. Arms, Mr. Vandervate, Mr. Warner, Mr. Cook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5117)|
| 1:25:21| they drive home cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5121)|
| 1:25:23| Ms. Finch did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5123)|
| 1:25:25| So where was her actual auto allowance then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5125)|
| 1:25:30| Wouldn't her dollar figure be different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5130)|
| 1:25:32| Because she would be claiming an auto allowance because she did not have a county vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5132)|
| 1:25:37| So I would just assume that her dollar figure would be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5137)|
| 1:25:41| Except this wasn't for an auto allowance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5141)|
| 1:25:44| Then where did her auto allowance reimbursements come in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5144)|
| 1:25:47| Where was the line item for that or where was that paid back to her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5147)|
| 1:25:52| I understand that Ms. Finch was offered a county car and she declined the offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5152)|
| 1:25:56| That's not my question, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5156)|
| 1:25:57| My question, sir, is how was that paid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5157)|
| 1:26:00| If it wasn't paid through this auto allowance account, where was it shown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5160)|
| 1:26:05| Where was it paid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5165)|
| 1:26:07| To reimburse her for her actual auto allowance expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5167)|
| 1:26:11| There were occasions when Ms. Finch claimed miles and claimed expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5171)|
| 1:26:19| So wouldn't that monthly dollar figure of 461.54, wouldn't that be different then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5179)|
| 1:26:25| Wouldn't that fluctuate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5185)|
| 1:26:26| It wouldn't be a constant figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5186)|
| 1:26:33| You know, she would have to turn in individual expense reports for different trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5193)|
| 1:26:38| And I think the intent of this really was give an expense allowance slash salary supplement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5198)|
| 1:26:45| It's been called a lot of different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5205)|
| 1:26:47| And the mayor felt that it was important to give these people the same amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5207)|
| 1:26:52| And that's within his discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5212)|
| 1:26:54| This is a decision the mayor makes to pay his people the appropriate amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5214)|
| 1:27:01| Commissioner Lutho, three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5221)|
| 1:27:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5225)|
| 1:27:08| The resolution before us asks for the legal opinion of the Knox County Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5228)|
| 1:27:14| pursuant to recommendations of the county auditor on whether unlawful acts have occurred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5234)|
| 1:27:20| and if any restitution should be made to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5240)|
| 1:27:27| I believe the law director has already answered that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5247)|
| 1:27:33| I believe he answered that quite a time back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5253)|
| 1:27:37| And I can either go along with Commissioner Hammonds that he's been asked and answered this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5257)|
| 1:27:46| or go ahead and make a motion to approve this knowing that he's already answered it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5266)|
| 1:27:53| So it's a pleasure, as far as I'm concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5273)|
| 1:27:56| with this commission as to whether we want to continue with this line of questioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5276)|
| 1:28:02| But the resolution we have before us has already been answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5282)|
| 1:28:05| So I'm not trying to cut off any further debate, but this is where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5285)|
| 1:28:14| And, you know, Mr. Chairman, I would like to go ahead and make a motion to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5294)|
| 1:28:21| and approve this resolution, if I could get a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5301)|
| 1:28:27| We still have some lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5307)|
| 1:28:28| Well, it's, you know, normally you have to have a motion before you're supposed to debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5308)|
| 1:28:35| Before you cut off debate, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5315)|
| 1:28:37| So by making this the motion and then if it's properly seconded, we can continue on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5317)|
| 1:28:46| But this is the end result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5326)|
| 1:28:49| Any advice from our law director on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5329)|
| 1:28:52| I mean, the motion is proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5332)|
| 1:28:54| He's not moving to cut off debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5334)|
| 1:28:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5338)|
| 1:29:02| So I'm going to make a motion that we approve the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5342)|
| 1:29:08| If he's already answered the resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5348)|
| 1:29:11| Well, he has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5351)|
| 1:29:13| We have already asked him earlier if he felt like there's been any unlawful acts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5353)|
| 1:29:19| And he's already said in his opinion, no, there have not been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5359)|
| 1:29:26| And, well, I guess we could ask you if you believe there's any restitution that should happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5366)|
| 1:29:34| No, based upon what I said earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5374)|
| 1:29:36| I really don't have anything else to add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5376)|
| 1:29:39| I could repeat what I said earlier, but nothing that's been said here today has changed my opinion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5379)|
| 1:29:47| You know, again, you have to look back at the history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5387)|
| 1:29:50| You have to look at what this commission has done over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5390)|
| 1:29:53| I've been here almost 18 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5393)|
| 1:29:56| Some of you may have been here that long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5396)|
| 1:30:00| You have to look at what this body did, absent the new members, in January of this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5400)|
| 1:30:08| So, no, not related to this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5408)|
| 1:30:13| So I'll second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5413)|
| 1:30:15| Motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5415)|
| 1:30:16| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5416)|
| 1:30:19| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5419)|
| 1:30:20| With that said, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5420)|
| 1:30:21| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5421)|
| 1:30:22| I'd like to make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5422)|
| 1:30:25| My substitute motion would be that we accept Mr. Wall's report, that we accept the legal opinion from our law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5425)|
| 1:30:31| I'll add that, too, that we accepted the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5431)|
| 1:30:37| And that we take no further action on the travel audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5437)|
| 1:30:40| In other words, it's put to bed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5440)|
| 1:30:42| Well, I mean, I'd second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5442)|
| 1:30:46| What we've done is he's already answered it, but, you know, I mean, however we want to put this, I mean, he's already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5446)|
| 1:30:53| he's been asked and answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5453)|
| 1:30:56| I think our people want us to dispose of this one way or the other, and that's my motion is that we dispose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5456)|
| 1:31:00| I mean, we can continue with discussion, but that would be my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5460)|
| 1:31:04| Well, you're not going to put that with Mr. Lutho's motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5464)|
| 1:31:09| I'm willing to do it if we say no further action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5469)|
| 1:31:11| Well, and that no further action occur because he's already been asked and answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5471)|
| 1:31:17| Are you just adding to his motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5477)|
| 1:31:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5479)|
| 1:31:20| I've accepted his friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5480)|
| 1:31:21| Do you accept that as a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5481)|
| 1:31:24| I'll accept it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5484)|
| 1:31:25| I understand what our law director said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5485)|
| 1:31:27| We're beating a dead horse here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5487)|
| 1:31:29| I mean, I know a lot of us are not satisfied with what's happened, and maybe they will be satisfied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5489)|
| 1:31:33| But evidently until someone can convince our law department that there's been a misdoing here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5493)|
| 1:31:38| and somebody needs to pay it back, we're through as far as I'm concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5498)|
| 1:31:42| So you accept?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5502)|
| 1:31:44| We still have some lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5504)|
| 1:31:46| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5506)|
| 1:31:48| Yes, I know this isn't going to change anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5508)|
| 1:31:50| We're going to go on and do whatever we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5510)|
| 1:31:52| But I guess this is a question to John Troyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5512)|
| 1:31:56| How many other employees under the mayor's control receives a supplement to their pay in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5516)|
| 1:32:03| Right now or at any time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5523)|
| 1:32:12| I guess at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5532)|
| 1:32:14| Did a hundred other employees receive some kind of supplement paid to their regular pay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5534)|
| 1:32:20| Just the ones that you see that were addressed here in today's discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5540)|
| 1:32:24| Do you feel, I guess, the next question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5544)|
| 1:32:30| I won't ask the next question, but I'll get on to my next question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5550)|
| 1:32:32| I just want to correct myself because one of the things that I was corrected by Mr. VandeVate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5552)|
| 1:32:40| this past year and it's been a practice for many years, several years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5560)|
| 1:32:45| employees with 15 years of service in Christmas time, they get $400 as a supplement bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5565)|
| 1:32:52| Employees with 20 years of service, they get $500 at Christmas time as a supplement or a bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5572)|
| 1:32:59| This past year there were two different occasions where employees, some of them under a certain dollar amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5579)|
| 1:33:05| got a bonus of $500 and some of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5585)|
| 1:33:08| That was because the commission didn't want to give a percentage raise because the top of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5588)|
| 1:33:13| who make more money would have made all the funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5593)|
| 1:33:17| And somebody making $20,000 would have got four or five hundred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5597)|
| 1:33:21| So that's why we did those two different for $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5601)|
| 1:33:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5604)|
| 1:33:25| And that's, in my opinion, that's a salary supplement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5605)|
| 1:33:27| I believe it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5607)|
| 1:33:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5608)|
| 1:33:29| Let me, Mrs. Finch, you said received mileage reimbursement from time to time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5609)|
| 1:33:35| Was any of her reimbursement from in-town travel in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5615)|
| 1:33:42| Or was it out of, like out of county going to Nashville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5622)|
| 1:33:45| I'm not prepared to speak to her expense reports and they've been available for some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5625)|
| 1:33:51| but we can get some of that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5631)|
| 1:33:53| Well, I didn't see none that were from in-town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5633)|
| 1:33:58| I guess the next question is for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5638)|
| 1:34:01| You know, maybe there's no fraud or no crime being violated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5641)|
| 1:34:09| but do you see that any charter violations or Knox County policies have been in violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5649)|
| 1:34:15| because I believe the mayor's salary is supposed to be set by a resolution only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5655)|
| 1:34:19| So the resolution, how do you go back and add a supplement if there's no resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5659)|
| 1:34:26| Or do we just do a resolution for his base pay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5666)|
| 1:34:30| The budget that was approved for the mayor and within that budget was also the rest of these monies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5670)|
| 1:34:41| And so that was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5681)|
| 1:34:42| You know, and approved by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5682)|
| 1:34:46| The mayor is the top compensated elected official of the county by the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5686)|
| 1:34:56| Virtually, that's the floor, that's the basement that he has to be the top elected official of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5696)|
| 1:35:06| But the base pay would be like $140,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5706)|
| 1:35:09| Whatever this body approves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5709)|
| 1:35:11| And the charter says it's to be done by resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5711)|
| 1:35:14| Now, was his salary done by resolution or just done in a budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5714)|
| 1:35:18| Done by budget resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5718)|
| 1:35:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5720)|
| 1:35:21| I'm ready to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5721)|
| 1:35:22| I'm sure everybody else is ready to move in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5722)|
| 1:35:23| We're not going to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5723)|
| 1:35:23| So citizens of Knox County, just pay attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5723)|
| 1:35:27| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5727)|
| 1:35:30| I think it's time that we put this to rest, just like everyone else has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5730)|
| 1:35:34| But I think for the future what we need to do is to make very clear in the budget what's salary, what's not salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5734)|
| 1:35:41| What's happened is it's raised questions not only in this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5741)|
| 1:35:45| who has followed this very closely and voted for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5745)|
| 1:35:48| I think there's people here that voted for something that they didn't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5748)|
| 1:35:52| And even more important, the taxpayers, the voters, and the citizens of this county get the impression that there's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5752)|
| 1:35:59| transparency and clarity in their government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5759)|
| 1:36:02| Even if the intentions are absolutely pure and there was no malice, no attempt to obtain funds by subterfuge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5762)|
| 1:36:13| I think it's extremely important that we make it absolutely clear so the citizens know what people are being paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5773)|
| 1:36:19| and the commissioners know what they're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5779)|
| 1:36:21| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5781)|
| 1:36:22| I agree, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5782)|
| 1:36:26| I'm sure it won't be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5786)|
| 1:36:28| Commissioner DeFreeze, you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5788)|
| 1:36:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5791)|
| 1:36:32| I was looking at page six back following the allowance report, that tab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5792)|
| 1:36:39| And it says here that it appears that all the employees are subject to the pay setting scale except Mike Ragsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5799)|
| 1:36:47| And that that salary is set at $140,000 according to section 3.04 of the Knox County Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5807)|
| 1:36:54| And I understand that we've gone around and around and around about this and that now it's been set by the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5814)|
| 1:37:00| And he actually now receives $160,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5820)|
| 1:37:04| It also states here that unilaterally increasing salaries through a salary supplement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5824)|
| 1:37:08| the uniform pay setting system was not followed in section 3.04 of the Knox County Charter has been violated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5828)|
| 1:37:14| So we really have two differing opinions from our inspector, our internal auditor, and our law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5834)|
| 1:37:21| So either, you know, we have an internal auditor who says that it is being violated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5841)|
| 1:37:26| Our law department is saying it's not being violated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5846)|
| 1:37:29| I wonder what the next inspector general, if that is approved in our budget, would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5849)|
| 1:37:35| It also says that the supplement paid to Mike Ragsdale could also have the effect of violating section 824102,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5855)|
| 1:37:43| Tennessee Code annotated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5863)|
| 1:37:44| This statute establishes the county mayor's minimum salary, which must be approved by the county legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5864)|
| 1:37:50| The additional compensation, salary supplements, results in a total salary amount that is greater than $140,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5870)|
| 1:37:58| and $1 approved by a county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5878)|
| 1:38:01| I think that all of this has been very foggy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5881)|
| 1:38:04| I think that when you look here, I know that the law director says that, you know, we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5884)|
| 1:38:09| Knox County Commission has approved it because it was budgeted for Ragsdale and Cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5889)|
| 1:38:13| Our internal auditor says that Arms Warner and Vandivate, that that was not budgeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5893)|
| 1:38:18| We have payroll procedures that were not following the proper format.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5898)|
| 1:38:25| I see just so many questions here, a lot of irregularities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5905)|
| 1:38:28| And, you know, we wonder why Knox County citizens have had a loss of confidence in the executive branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5908)|
| 1:38:36| We wonder why they've had a loss of confidence in county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5916)|
| 1:38:40| And I believe to pass this would only further the loss of confidence in the general public for not calling this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5920)|
| 1:38:49| what it actually is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5929)|
| 1:38:50| And, you know, I am not going to, I just think this is shameful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5930)|
| 1:38:54| So I just wanted to share that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5934)|
| 1:38:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5935)|
| 1:38:57| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5937)|
| 1:38:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5939)|
| 1:39:01| I call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5941)|
| 1:39:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5943)|
| 1:39:05| We've got a call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5945)|
| 1:39:06| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5946)|
| 1:39:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5947)|
| 1:39:08| Mr. Chairman, I'd like to make a motion, or not a motion, just ask you to do it by roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=5948)|

| 1:40:13| Seventeen yes, one no, and one person is out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6013)|
| 1:40:19| So we will go back to the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6019)|
| 1:40:22| Oh, the motion because he added on to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6022)|
| 1:40:25| Just a brief comment, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6025)|
| 1:40:28| I've had people that are watching this on television that are interested in how their commissioners are voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6028)|
| 1:40:34| and how people are voting, and when people don't speak into the microphone, they can't hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6034)|
| 1:40:38| And could I request that the clerk, when it's not spoken into the microphone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6038)|
| 1:40:42| repeat Commissioner so and so yes or Commissioner so and so no if it can't be heard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6042)|
| 1:40:48| If everyone would just speak into the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6048)|
| 1:40:50| I mentioned that in a governmental finance that we couldn't hear when I reviewed the tapes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6050)|
| 1:40:57| what people were actually saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6057)|
| 1:40:59| So if everyone would pull the microphone down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6059)|
| 1:41:03| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6063)|
| 1:41:06| All in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6066)|
| 1:41:07| Well, we have to take a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6067)|
| 1:41:09| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6069)|
| 1:41:10| Could you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6070)|
| 1:41:11| I'd like to do it by roll call, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6071)|
| 1:41:12| I would like one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6072)|
| 1:41:13| Could you also restate the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6073)|
| 1:41:15| Greg, if you would restate your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6075)|
| 1:41:18| We're accepting the auditor's report, and we're approving the resolution asking for the law director to give his opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6078)|
| 1:41:30| on whether or not any lawful acts or any restitution should be made back to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6090)|
| 1:41:36| But we're also adding in there, which is the resolution that was before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6096)|
| 1:41:40| but we're also acknowledging that the law director just gave us the answer to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6100)|
| 1:41:47| which was that he said he doesn't believe that and that no further action needs to be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6107)|
| 1:41:55| since he's already given his opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6115)|
| 1:41:57| He's been asked and he's been answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6117)|
| 1:42:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6120)|
| 1:42:01| With regard to the travel allowance, that's all we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6121)|
| 1:42:06| With that, roll call vote starting in the ninth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6126)|
| 1:42:16| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6136)|

| 1:43:27| Now we're moving on to the purchasing, P cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6207)|
| 1:43:33| Mr. Wiles, would you give us your summary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6213)|
| 1:43:40| Okay, if you go ahead and turn to the P card summary tab, you'll find a similar flow chart, and as we did previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6220)|
| 1:43:49| we'll proceed down Column A, what should exist, and then move to Column B, and what did exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6229)|
| 1:43:59| Okay, Row 1, Column A, application approval, agreement, training, and card issuance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6239)|
| 1:44:07| The purchasing card is issued after training and the signing of an agreement by an employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6247)|
| 1:44:13| Examples of these agreements are seen at Exhibit 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6253)|
| 1:44:18| Okay, Row 2, Column A, card use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6258)|
| 1:44:22| Card use is controlled through blocking vendor types and spending limits, and a profile form that does this is shown in Exhibit 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6262)|
| 1:44:33| Okay, Row 3, Column A, documentation review of purchases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6273)|
| 1:44:39| The cardholder obtains the original receipt and maintains them until the statement is received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6279)|
| 1:44:45| The department head, supervisor, and purchasing card rep are responsible for reviewing each purchase to make sure personal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6285)|
| 1:44:51| purchases are not made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6291)|
| 1:44:55| Okay, Row 4, Column A, accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6295)|
| 1:44:59| The cardholder maintains the original receipt and compares them to the statement when it's received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6299)|
| 1:45:05| The department head, supervisor, and purchasing card rep review the cardholder statement, compare the receipts to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6305)|
| 1:45:12| statement, and then verify the distribution as shown on Exhibit 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6312)|
| 1:45:20| Okay, Row 5, Column A, expense reimbursements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6320)|
| 1:45:24| Now this, what I'm getting ready to say is an important concept that will help you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6324)|
| 1:45:29| The purchasing card is simply a method of payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6329)|
| 1:45:33| The P-card policy does not determine if an expense is proper or improper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6333)|
| 1:45:39| It's a method of payment just like cash or a check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6339)|
| 1:45:45| Knox County has always had reimbursement policies that determine what is acceptable and not acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6345)|
| 1:45:52| The policy requires completion of a form for reimbursement, covers transportation, mileage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6352)|
| 1:45:58| meals in the form of a per diem, and is very clear about non-reimbursable items such as alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6358)|
| 1:46:05| If you go to Exhibit 6, you will see these policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6365)|
| 1:46:11| Okay, let's move to Column B, what actually happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6371)|
| 1:46:17| Okay, Row 1, Column B, application approval agreement, training, and card issuance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6377)|
| 1:46:25| Agreements were signed by all cardholders as you see in Exhibit 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6385)|
| 1:46:30| The cardholders agreed the card is for business purposes, not personal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6390)|
| 1:46:35| and improper use is considered misappropriation, which will result in discipline, including termination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6395)|
| 1:46:42| And as you know, four of the persons examined in this report are no longer employed by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6402)|
| 1:46:49| Okay, Row 2, Column B, card use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6409)|
| 1:46:53| Restrictions that control card use were waived for some cardholders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6413)|
| 1:46:58| allowing the ability to charge travel and meals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6418)|
| 1:47:01| You can see this at Exhibit 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6421)|
| 1:47:05| Okay, Row 3, Column B, documentation and review of purchases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6425)|
| 1:47:10| Okay, receipts are required for each transaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6430)|
| 1:47:14| When we initiated this review, over 700 or around 36 percent of the receipts were missing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6434)|
| 1:47:21| for the transactions examined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6441)|
| 1:47:24| This is illustrated at Exhibit 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6444)|
| 1:47:27| Okay, even though personal charges are not permitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6447)|
| 1:47:30| $11,080 in charges have already been reimbursed to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6450)|
| 1:47:37| These amounts that were reimbursed are detailed in Exhibit 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6457)|
| 1:47:41| Okay, around $39,000 in charges remain to be dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6461)|
| 1:47:46| Some of these have receipts, however, most do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6466)|
| 1:47:50| These amounts have been explained but are not backed up with receipts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6470)|
| 1:47:55| In my opinion, based on Knox County policy, there needs to be a determination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6475)|
| 1:47:59| whether or not any of these amounts need to be repaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6479)|
| 1:48:02| Because without a valid receipt, there is still uncertainty to what these charges were really for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6482)|
| 1:48:11| On page 17 of the actual report, we point out that 12 forged invoices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6491)|
| 1:48:17| were discovered during the examination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6497)|
| 1:48:20| In my opinion, this is one of the more serious issues that we need to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6500)|
| 1:48:27| Row 4, Column B, Accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6507)|
| 1:48:32| Each month, the department head and the purchasing card rep and cardholder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6512)|
| 1:48:36| account for the charges by reviewing the statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6516)|
| 1:48:39| matching the receipts, and preparing the distribution statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6519)|
| 1:48:44| These statements were signed off on over and over despite 700 or more missing receipts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6524)|
| 1:48:50| An example of this can be found in Exhibit 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6530)|
| 1:48:55| When we performed our work, there was no evidence that these receipts were even pursued timely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6535)|
| 1:49:02| Row 5, Column B, Expense Reimbursements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6542)|
| 1:49:07| Reimbursement policies and procedures were not followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6547)|
| 1:49:11| Reimbursement forms were rarely used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6551)|
| 1:49:14| Actual charges were used for meals instead of the required per diem amounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6554)|
| 1:49:18| Local meals were charged in violation of the reimbursement policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6558)|
| 1:49:23| Gas was charged for personal vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6563)|
| 1:49:26| Alcohol was charged to the purchasing cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6566)|
| 1:49:29| The policies were simply not followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6569)|
| 1:49:33| You can look at Exhibit 6 and it gives you the excerpts from the reimbursement policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6573)|
| 1:49:43| In this area, definitely policies and procedures were not followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6583)|
| 1:49:49| In my opinion, a determination needs to be made if these amounts should be paid back to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6589)|
| 1:49:56| whether any laws were broken or any ethics violated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6596)|
| 1:50:01| That concludes my remarks and I'll be happy to entertain questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6601)|
| 1:50:06| Are there any questions for Mr. Walsh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6606)|
| 1:50:13| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6613)|
| 1:50:15| Richard, you mentioned in your report that there are 80 people that are able to charge travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6615)|
| 1:50:21| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6621)|
| 1:50:23| Not anymore, but at the time, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6623)|
| 1:50:25| At the time this was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6625)|
| 1:50:27| Did those people, were they all across Knox County government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6627)|
| 1:50:30| They varied, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6630)|
| 1:50:32| Now, how would that work at that time if you had 80 people that were eligible to charge travel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6632)|
| 1:50:39| I mean, would they charge it on their P-Card?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6639)|
| 1:50:43| In other words, how would the travel work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6643)|
| 1:50:46| Okay, those restrictions were lifted on their P-Card, so they would be able to charge travel on their P-Card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6646)|
| 1:50:53| And what they should do is file the reimbursement form to account for those expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6653)|
| 1:51:01| So let's say, for example, I'm going to, and where I'm getting at here is we have a lot of employees who really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6661)|
| 1:51:09| are not able to put on their own credit card $1,000 for a plane trip or put on their own card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6669)|
| 1:51:16| So the county card is provided as a means for them to travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6676)|
| 1:51:21| Now, if I do that, then you're saying we need to have the proper documentation for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6681)|
| 1:51:30| So if we put it on a county card, for example, and we get an airline ticket or we get a hotel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6690)|
| 1:51:35| we should come back and bring those receipts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6695)|
| 1:51:37| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6697)|
| 1:51:39| The P-Card was only the method of payment they should have been accounted for on a reimbursement form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6699)|
| 1:51:46| But there was no problem with them using the card to book the travel and book the hotel rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6706)|
| 1:51:51| It was just a matter of showing the proper documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6711)|
| 1:51:54| Yes, the receipts and as long as they account for the expenses on their trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6714)|
| 1:51:59| Now, what we found was meals were charged on the P-Card and the reimbursement form was not completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6719)|
| 1:52:07| to account for the proper per diem amounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6727)|
| 1:52:11| On the meals, you've taken the position that, and I don't want to put words in your mouth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6731)|
| 1:52:16| so let me just ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6736)|
| 1:52:17| If you take someone to lunch, let's say, for example, I'm the mayor or I'm the sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6737)|
| 1:52:24| and Governor Bredesen comes to town and I take the governor to lunch and I ask for reimbursement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6744)|
| 1:52:32| Is that proper if we go to a restaurant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6752)|
| 1:52:35| According to the reimbursement policy, the only meals we reimburse are for out-of-town travel overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6755)|
| 1:52:42| But if you have a budget in your department and that budget says food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6762)|
| 1:52:48| and you take the governor to lunch and you turn that in, is that still not acceptable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6768)|
| 1:52:54| I'm asking for your opinion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6774)|
| 1:52:57| Well, I have a $300 food line item in my budget and I do not use that for lunch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6777)|
| 1:53:05| or taking other people to lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6785)|
| 1:53:07| That's more designed for meetings, supplies, utensils, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6787)|
| 1:53:13| I don't see that as proper reporting as far as, you know, meals at lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6793)|
| 1:53:21| Food is, as the chart of accounts in the general ledger has described,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6801)|
| 1:53:25| is not for eating out at restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6805)|
| 1:53:28| But if I take the governor to lunch and it's a business meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6808)|
| 1:53:31| what would be the difference if the governor came to my office, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6811)|
| 1:53:34| and I ordered lunchbox and brought in the lunchbox?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6814)|
| 1:53:38| I mean, in other words, in your opinion, is it ever proper to take the governor or Senator Alexander| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6818)|
| 1:53:45| or if the CEO of a company comes in and they're taking to lunch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6825)|
| 1:53:50| In your view, that's never acceptable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6830)|
| 1:53:52| Not in my opinion, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6832)|
| 1:53:55| Or even bringing in a box lunch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6835)|
| 1:53:57| Unless we revise the reimbursement policies, it's not allowable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6837)|
| 1:54:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6842)|
| 1:54:05| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6845)|
| 1:54:08| Yes, Mr. Wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6848)|
| 1:54:10| A couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6850)|
| 1:54:11| You have, as of the first exhibit, the signing of the agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6851)|
| 1:54:17| but you also talked about training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6857)|
| 1:54:19| Did you investigate the training at all and what the training consisted of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6859)|
| 1:54:25| I participated in it myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6865)|
| 1:54:28| And from what we were told, everyone that received a P-card were trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6868)|
| 1:54:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6874)|
| 1:54:35| So now, in my digging, it looked like it seemed that they revamped the training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6875)|
| 1:54:42| made it a little more rigorous or robust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6882)|
| 1:54:44| Is that a true statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6884)|
| 1:54:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6886)|
| 1:54:47| I attended the second version also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6887)|
| 1:54:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6889)|
| 1:54:50| So you attended the one in 2002 where this first group of people signed the P-cards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6890)|
| 1:54:56| and you attended the more robust or the more complete?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6896)|
| 1:55:00| Yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6900)|
| 1:55:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6901)|
| 1:55:02| So in this first one, because as I look at the agreement, and if you have those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6902)|
| 1:55:10| I would love to get those just to kind of the PowerPoint or whatever the process was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6910)|
| 1:55:16| Because in terms of what the agreement, the P-card agreement, just picking liquor out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6916)|
| 1:55:23| I don't see anything on here that says you shall not purchase liquor by the drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6923)|
| 1:55:28| P-card policy does not cover allowable expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6928)|
| 1:55:32| So that will come from another policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6932)|
| 1:55:34| P-card is only a method of payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6934)|
| 1:55:37| It does not tell you what's proper or improper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6937)|
| 1:55:41| Well, but then I turn to the Exhibit 2, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6941)|
| 1:55:44| It says purchasing card profile information form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6944)|
| 1:55:47| And in that form, it tells you, it allows you to open up some things for the P-card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6947)|
| 1:55:52| So there are some things that aren't allowable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6952)|
| 1:55:55| I understand that it's a vehicle to get the payment and then you'll dole out the account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6955)|
| 1:56:00| But it seems, you know, just from an uninformed eye, that there are restrictions placed on the P-card purchases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6960)|
| 1:56:07| And in these cases, for the mayor and Margie Lloyd and whoever else is on this list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6967)|
| 1:56:12| there are some things that open up, be it air travel, hotel, restaurants, and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6972)|
| 1:56:18| So do you understand my question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6978)|
| 1:56:20| Yeah, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6980)|
| 1:56:21| Those are just controls on the P-card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6981)|
| 1:56:25| Are they policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6985)|
| 1:56:26| No, those are just controls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6986)|
| 1:56:29| I'm not an auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6989)|
| 1:56:31| Policies, we have a reimbursement policy that covers what's allowed and what's not allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6991)|
| 1:56:38| P-card policy does not cover that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=6998)|
| 1:56:42| P-card, just like I said earlier, it's a method of payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7002)|
| 1:56:46| You have certain controls on those payments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7006)|
| 1:56:49| For instance, I have a P-card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7009)|
| 1:56:53| Let's turn to, I mean, in this, in Exhibit 2, it says purchasing card profile information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7013)|
| 1:57:04| It gives the department name and the person's name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7024)|
| 1:57:09| And it says you can block any or all of the travel and entertainment merchants group by checking the appropriate boxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7029)|
| 1:57:17| So a person, if I'm an accountant employee and you deem it worthy for me to have a P-card,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7037)|
| 1:57:25| but you don't want me to do any of these, so I come in and I take the training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7045)|
| 1:57:29| and my department head puts an X by each of these boxes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7049)|
| 1:57:33| Is that the way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7053)|
| 1:57:34| Go ahead and turn to Exhibit 2, 5 of 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7054)|
| 1:57:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7060)|
| 1:57:41| Okay, that's an example of how the sheriff's department would handle a P-card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7061)|
| 1:57:47| You basically just buy supplies and things for your office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7067)|
| 1:57:53| So it's not a policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7073)|
| 1:57:55| It's not a policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7075)|
| 1:57:56| It's just a control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7076)|
| 1:57:57| It's a control that each person is individually screened by his or her department head and okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7077)|
| 1:58:04| And that's what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7084)|
| 1:58:06| You had 80 plus people that these restrictions were lifted on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7086)|
| 1:58:11| or they were able to charge travel, meals, gas, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7091)|
| 1:58:17| But this form is not part of the P-card training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7097)|
| 1:58:20| It's not part of the P-card policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7100)|
| 1:58:25| Yes, this is part of the P-card system here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7105)|
| 1:58:28| And I guess what I'm saying is that there's a separate reimbursement policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7108)|
| 1:58:34| that covers what's acceptable and what's not acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7114)|
| 1:58:38| Could this be part of the P-card policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7118)|
| 1:58:40| Because where I work, it's crystal clear things that you can't buy, like a chemical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7120)|
| 1:58:47| or we can't buy caulk or things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7127)|
| 1:58:50| But it's part of the policy and it's clearly explained in the training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7130)|
| 1:58:54| It's saying you can't do these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7134)|
| 1:58:56| Don't think about doing these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7136)|
| 1:58:58| This is a condition of your employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7138)|
| 1:59:00| If you do these things, bad things are going to happen to you and your future worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7140)|
| 1:59:05| So did you look at any of that as far as the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7145)|
| 1:59:11| or did we just look at the numbers in terms of who did what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7151)|
| 1:59:16| No, we did look at whether we thought the P-card purchases were acceptable or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7156)|
| 1:59:22| Based on the reimbursement policy, not the P-card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7162)|
| 1:59:26| On whether the people understood the processes, I guess is what I'm trying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7166)|
| 1:59:30| And believe me, I'm not trying to defend anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7170)|
| 1:59:33| But I do want to understand, for all these people getting all these P-cards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7173)|
| 1:59:39| do they clearly understand what the do's and don'ts are of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7179)|
| 1:59:44| Did they in 2002 and do they now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7184)|
| 1:59:48| I can tell you when I took the training, I was afraid to use my P-card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7188)|
| 1:59:52| That's the way it should be, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7192)|
| 1:59:53| And I agree wholeheartedly with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7193)|
| 1:59:55| But how about in 2002?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7195)|
| 1:59:57| Even more so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7197)|
| 2:00:00| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7200)|
| 2:00:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7202)|
| 2:00:04| I'm going to refer to Exhibit 6 here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7204)|
| 2:00:07| It's excerpts from the Travel Policy Handbook dated October 1, 2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7207)|
| 2:00:13| And it's at the very back of this section, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7213)|
| 2:00:16| And this may address some of the questions that Commissioner McKenzie had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7216)|
| 2:00:22| First of all, are meals not associated with overnight travel allowed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7222)|
| 2:00:30| Not under this policy, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7230)|
| 2:00:34| When people go on overnight travel, what is the process for being reimbursed for the travel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7234)|
| 2:00:43| as far as their hotels and meals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7243)|
| 2:00:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7247)|
| 2:00:48| Each year, there's reimbursement rates based on location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7248)|
| 2:00:54| You know, in fact, larger cities, you would receive more per diem for your meals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7254)|
| 2:01:01| than you would, say, in Knoxville if you were traveling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7261)|
| 2:01:05| The same thing holds true with hotel rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7265)|
| 2:01:08| There's a maximum amount that you can charge for a hotel room based on where you travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7268)|
| 2:01:14| And these rates are changed annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7274)|
| 2:01:17| To get back to my first question, were there meals charged on these cards that were not associated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7277)|
| 2:01:22| with overnight travel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7282)|
| 2:01:24| Yes, there were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7284)|
| 2:01:25| How many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7285)|
| 2:01:26| If you go to the allowance, I'm sorry, the PCARD report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7286)|
| 2:01:44| it's Exhibit 10 in the actual report itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7304)|
| 2:01:50| The answer to my question is many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7310)|
| 2:01:52| Yes, many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7312)|
| 2:01:54| Were there hotels charged on that PCARD for overnight travel that there was no TER submitted when they returned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7314)|
| 2:02:03| Yes, there were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7323)|
| 2:02:04| Were there many or just an occasional?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7324)|
| 2:02:06| Quite a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7326)|
| 2:02:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7327)|
| 2:02:08| I don't have an exact number, but quite a few, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7328)|
| 2:02:11| And that is contrary to policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7331)|
| 2:02:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7333)|
| 2:02:14| And the meals that were charged are contrary to policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7334)|
| 2:02:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7336)|
| 2:02:17| Were alcoholic beverages charged to the purchasing card?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7337)|
| 2:02:24| If you go to Exhibit 12 in the actual report, there's what we know of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7344)|
| 2:02:32| So the answer is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7352)|
| 2:02:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7353)|
| 2:02:34| And that's contrary to policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7354)|
| 2:02:36| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7356)|
| 2:02:38| Were there personal items ever charged to the PCARD?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7358)|
| 2:02:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7363)|
| 2:02:44| If you go to page 16 of the actual report and look at the table, column C,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7364)|
| 2:03:00| reimbursed by employee, some of those amounts would be personal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7380)|
| 2:03:04| And that's contrary to policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7384)|
| 2:03:06| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7386)|
| 2:03:12| When you reviewed these records, did you ever see a TER from this office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7392)|
| 2:03:18| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7398)|
| 2:03:19| If you look at that same table on page 16, the top section of that table is PCARD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7399)|
| 2:03:28| charges and the bottom section is expense reimbursement forms that were filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7408)|
| 2:03:37| On county employees that have county vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7417)|
| 2:03:40| what is the policy for charging gasoline to those vehicles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7420)|
| 2:03:47| In some cases, people would have a pilot charge card or if they're in a location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7427)|
| 2:03:53| where there's not a pilot, they would use another, you know, brand of gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7433)|
| 2:04:00| And then they can also get gas at the vehicle service center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7440)|
| 2:04:06| Now, for employees that do not have a county vehicle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7446)|
| 2:04:10| what is the policy for them to be reimbursed for their travel mileage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7450)|
| 2:04:15| There, they actually charge a point-to-point mileage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7455)|
| 2:04:18| and are reimbursed at the IRS mileage rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7458)|
| 2:04:21| Were there instances where county employees that had private vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7461)|
| 2:04:25| bought gas for those vehicles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7465)|
| 2:04:27| Yes, there were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7467)|
| 2:04:28| And is that contrary to policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7468)|
| 2:04:31| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7471)|
| 2:04:33| As far as the responsibility of the supervisors, the departmental heads, the offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7473)|
| 2:04:41| when we went through the way the system was supposed to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7481)|
| 2:04:45| I recall that each individual is supposed to submit the receipt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7485)|
| 2:04:51| They're supposed to validate the charges that were on the statement from the purchasing card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7491)|
| 2:04:57| Those are given to the departmental head to review and validate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7497)|
| 2:05:01| and then they're given to the departmental purchasing officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7501)|
| 2:05:04| to put on the distribution sheet that goes to finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7504)|
| 2:05:07| That's under the old system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7507)|
| 2:05:10| Well, that would still be the current system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7510)|
| 2:05:13| But it's just where the receipts are held now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7513)|
| 2:05:15| Now the receipts are held in the finance department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7515)|
| 2:05:17| And now the only difference is, right, the receipts are the actual receipts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7517)|
| 2:05:22| were actually sent to the finance department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7522)|
| 2:05:24| And that was dictated by policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7524)|
| 2:05:29| A change in policy, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7529)|
| 2:05:32| Now, did you find instances where departmental heads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7532)|
| 2:05:35| or even individuals did not validate those receipts and not turn receipts in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7535)|
| 2:05:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7543)|
| 2:05:45| And roughly what percentage of time were the statements validating the authenticity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7545)|
| 2:05:51| and the validity of those charges not signed by the departmental head?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7551)|
| 2:05:56| How often did that occur?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7556)|
| 2:05:57| Was it a rare instance or was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7557)|
| 2:05:59| You're saying now when the statement was not charged?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7559)|
| 2:06:04| If you go to page seven of the actual report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7564)|
| 2:06:20| at the bottom of the page we give instances of when statements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7580)|
| 2:06:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7586)|
| 2:06:31| And that was based on our sample of 217.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7591)|
| 2:06:34| So more than half the time this was not followed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7594)|
| 2:06:38| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7598)|
| 2:06:39| I guess I'm out of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7599)|
| 2:06:42| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7602)|
| 2:06:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7604)|
| 2:06:46| Were there cases of split tickets where they went over the amount limit they were being spent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7606)|
| 2:06:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7612)|
| 2:06:53| I'm aware of some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7613)|
| 2:06:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7614)|
| 2:06:59| Let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7619)|
| 2:07:03| The Palm Restaurant there where Ragsdale, Welch, and Wagley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7623)|
| 2:07:07| were they the only people at that meal where that was split?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7627)|
| 2:07:12| Are you referring to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7632)|
| 2:07:14| Exhibit three, page three, 8177.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7634)|
| 2:07:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7641)|
| 2:07:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7651)|
| 2:07:32| This is in the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7652)|
| 2:07:35| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7655)|
| 2:07:36| And what page number was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7656)|
| 2:07:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7658)|
| 2:07:39| I think I found 3-177.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7659)|
| 2:07:42| That particular receipt was split between Mike Ragsdale and John Werner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7662)|
| 2:07:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7670)|
| 2:07:51| Looking at a couple of these P-card charges here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7671)|
| 2:07:55| I noticed that the-what's the limit you're allowed to tip of a lay or a waiter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7675)|
| 2:08:04| or something on these P-cards on a meal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7684)|
| 2:08:08| I'm not aware of an exact percentage, but I would think 20 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7688)|
| 2:08:14| 20 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7694)|
| 2:08:15| I noticed that on one of these things I was looking at the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7695)|
| 2:08:20| 17 people including the mayor, Wagley, Arms, Joe Armstrong, Benny Ashley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7700)|
| 2:08:28| Senator Burchett, Commissioner Gelsen, and Nashville down there, 17 of them eat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7708)|
| 2:08:35| and the meal was $1,163.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7715)|
| 2:08:40| There was a $50 tip in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7720)|
| 2:08:44| The thing about it is per diem in Nashville is only $54 a meal per day, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7724)|
| 2:08:51| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7731)|
| 2:08:53| That's about right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7733)|
| 2:08:54| $54 a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7734)|
| 2:08:56| And they spent $68 a person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7736)|
| 2:08:58| You know, what really troubles me in this is in some of these people that we fed down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7738)|
| 2:09:04| were already on per diem from the state, most of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7744)|
| 2:09:08| But that seems to me like they didn't follow per diem or anything on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7748)|
| 2:09:14| On these bogus cards that Cynthia Finch turned in, you realize there was 12 bogus, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7754)|
| 2:09:22| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7762)|
| 2:09:23| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7763)|
| 2:09:25| I'd like to ask Mr. Arms some questions about that a little later on those bogus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7765)|
| 2:09:30| since he was the one that terminated her apparently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7770)|
| 2:09:35| You know, I don't know what this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7775)|
| 2:09:37| You know, even after these people were, I would say, caught,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7777)|
| 2:09:42| they still went over per diem on some of these things using their own personal card| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7782)|
| 2:09:46| in exchange for reimbursement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7786)|
| 2:09:48| But, you know, we have an agreement here, and in this agreement it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7788)|
| 2:09:57| improper use of this card can be considered misappropriation of county funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7797)|
| 2:10:01| which may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7801)|
| 2:10:06| The card is for business-related purposes only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7806)|
| 2:10:09| Personal charges are not to be made to the card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7809)|
| 2:10:11| And you said there were a lot of personal charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7811)|
| 2:10:13| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7813)|
| 2:10:14| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7814)|
| 2:10:17| All charges are billed directly to and paid directly by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7817)|
| 2:10:21| Any personal charges on this card will be considered misappropriation of county funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7821)|
| 2:10:27| since the cardholder cannot pay the bank directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7827)|
| 2:10:30| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7830)|
| 2:10:31| Is that our policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7831)|
| 2:10:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7832)|
| 2:10:35| Each cardholder is responsible for reconciling their monthly statements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7835)|
| 2:10:39| and resolving discrepancies by contacting the vendor or the bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7839)|
| 2:10:45| That's true, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7845)|
| 2:10:46| So, you know, these things were really misused by everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7846)|
| 2:10:49| And every one of these people that had these P cards, sir, they signed this agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7849)|
| 2:10:54| This one I'm holding in my hand here happens to be a sign by Mayor Mike Ragsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7854)|
| 2:10:59| Did everyone sign one of these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7859)|
| 2:11:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7861)|
| 2:11:03| In your opinion, would you not say, and on the front here it's got you cannot buy liquor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7863)|
| 2:11:08| it's checked and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7868)|
| 2:11:10| In your opinion, would you not say that this thing is pretty clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7870)|
| 2:11:15| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7875)|
| 2:11:18| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7878)|
| 2:11:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7881)|
| 2:11:22| I've got some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7882)|
| 2:11:23| I guess it would be for Hugh Holt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7883)|
| 2:11:26| Well, let's get through with Mr. Wells first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7886)|
| 2:11:31| Well, then will you come back to me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7891)|
| 2:11:34| Commissioner Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7894)|
| 2:11:37| Richard, going back to the purchasing card profile information form, who developed that form?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7897)|
| 2:11:46| I can't say exactly who, but that's when they came out with the purchasing card policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7906)|
| 2:11:55| I'm not sure if that was designed by the purchasing department or whether that was, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7915)|
| 2:12:00| a form they picked up from a service or where.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7920)|
| 2:12:04| You just acknowledge it came from the purchasing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7924)|
| 2:12:07| Yes, myself and Visa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7927)|
| 2:12:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7930)|
| 2:12:13| Richard, if I understand correctly, obviously I don't understand correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7933)|
| 2:12:19| you're saying that no meals can be purchased by a county employee even if they're out of town, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7939)|
| 2:12:27| Now, is that with the P card?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7947)|
| 2:12:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7949)|
| 2:12:30| What we're talking about is the reimbursement policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7950)|
| 2:12:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7952)|
| 2:12:33| So do they get a per diem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7953)|
| 2:12:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7956)|
| 2:12:37| And that per diem is to cover hotels, meals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7957)|
| 2:12:41| any expenditure that they have during the time that they leave Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7961)|
| 2:12:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7966)|
| 2:12:47| And then they have overnight travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7967)|
| 2:12:48| You have a meal per diem and then a limitation on the lodging charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7968)|
| 2:12:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7972)|
| 2:12:53| So they are paid for meals at a certain level with the per diem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7973)|
| 2:12:56| If they stay overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7976)|
| 2:13:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7982)|
| 2:13:03| Another note I've written to question, the dollars that were paid back by some of these employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7983)|
| 2:13:11| what were those dollars paid back to cover?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7991)|
| 2:13:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7994)|
| 2:13:15| If you go to Exhibit 4 of the P card summary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=7995)|
| 2:13:30| there's a listing on each individual of what amounts were paid back and for what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8010)|
| 2:13:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8039)|
| 2:14:02| Let me ask you this, Richard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8042)|
| 2:14:03| Based on what has been repaid versus what you found to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8043)|
| 2:14:09| you believe incorrectly documented or lack of documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8049)|
| 2:14:13| what's the result of the difference between the two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8053)|
| 2:14:18| Explain that to me again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8058)|
| 2:14:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8060)|
| 2:14:21| Obviously, there's what, 11,000 some odd dollars that's been paid back to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8061)|
| 2:14:27| Based on that, what's the difference monetarily between what's been paid back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8067)|
| 2:14:32| and what you believe that should be paid back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8072)|
| 2:14:35| I guess that would be the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8075)|
| 2:14:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8076)|
| 2:14:37| If you go to the actual report and go to page 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8077)|
| 2:15:01| And you look at the table, the last two columns are questionable amounts remaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8101)|
| 2:15:10| Column F is simply no receipt or documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8110)|
| 2:15:16| Column E is where there would have been a receipt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8116)|
| 2:15:19| but we felt there was insufficient documentation or business purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8119)|
| 2:15:26| So the total of column E and F is what's left to be dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8126)|
| 2:15:48| Thank you, Richard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8148)|
| 2:15:50| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8150)|
| 2:15:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8152)|
| 2:15:53| Sticking with page 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8153)|
| 2:15:59| So, for instance, the top column or the top graph there, you've got Mayor Ragsdale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8159)|
| 2:16:11| and you come all the way across and in your estimation, missing receipts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8171)|
| 2:16:17| or undocumented expenses, you've got $4,832, which is line F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8177)|
| 2:16:27| But you've got on line in column D, you've got reimbursed by the hospitality account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8187)|
| 2:16:36| And it looks as if you have subtracted that from or at least used that as part of paying back expenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8196)|
| 2:16:49| that maybe should not have been reimbursed or paid for on behalf of the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8209)|
| 2:16:56| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8216)|
| 2:17:01| That's the exact amounts that we show in the records that have been paid by the hospitality account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8221)|
| 2:17:07| And, you know, those particular items, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8227)|
| 2:17:10| we'll be dealing with when we issue the hospitality report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8230)|
| 2:17:16| I just have questions as to how you can use the hospitality account to pay back an individual's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8236)|
| 2:17:29| reimbursement for funds that need to be reimbursed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8249)|
| 2:17:35| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8255)|
| 2:17:36| Now, this particular table doesn't say it's okay or not okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8256)|
| 2:17:39| It just simply, you know, reports the fact that those amounts were repaid by the hospitality account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8259)|
| 2:17:50| Mr. Law Director, I guess we get back to the food budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8270)|
| 2:17:57| and what's allowable to use money for and what's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8277)|
| 2:18:01| I mean, the example of the governor or a CEO coming into town and the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8281)|
| 2:18:13| or someone, you know, takes them out for lunch or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8293)|
| 2:18:19| And I think most of us would think that that should be a legitimate expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8299)|
| 2:18:25| And if it's not part of, I guess, using a P-card| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8305)|
| 2:18:30| or some other way of being reimbursed for that expense, in your opinion, the food budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8310)|
| 2:18:39| I mean, should it come out of the food budget or not out of the food budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8319)|
| 2:18:43| Is that an allowable, in your opinion, is that an allowable expense or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8323)|
| 2:18:49| Let me just say I was shocked to learn that we had food budgets for all of these various departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8329)|
| 2:18:59| when that came out a month or so ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8339)|
| 2:19:03| I mean, I don't know what else it would be used for if it's not for if the governor comes in to town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8343)|
| 2:19:11| you want to treat the governor for lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8351)|
| 2:19:13| I mean, the commission passed a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8353)|
| 2:19:16| And apparently within that budget are food accounts for just about every major office of Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8356)|
| 2:19:27| I don't understand what that's for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8367)|
| 2:19:29| My office has never had a food budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8369)|
| 2:19:35| The sheriff's department is legally obligated to provide food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8375)|
| 2:19:38| The Knox County school board and Knox County schools are legally obligated to provide food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8378)|
| 2:19:45| I don't know who else in Knox County government has a legal obligation to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8385)|
| 2:19:51| But what would have been the commission's intent by passing a food item like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8391)|
| 2:19:58| You know, if you just looked at the strict letter of our policy, travel policy, then Mr. Walls has a really good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8398)|
| 2:20:06| But my question is, it becomes real fuzzy if we're passing food budgets for all of these offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8406)|
| 2:20:14| I mean, what else are they going to be used for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8414)|
| 2:20:17| Well, you know, in my thinking, and I agree with you, Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8417)|
| 2:20:23| when I look at a budget and I see a food item, and no disrespect to you, Mr. Walls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8423)|
| 2:20:29| I don't think of utilities or, I mean, utensils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8429)|
| 2:20:32| I don't think of dog food and some of the other items that you said would be allowable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8432)|
| 2:20:38| I'm not saying you're wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8438)|
| 2:20:40| I'm just, I guess I'm trying to reconcile what the budget and what maybe the intent of the budget line item is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8440)|
| 2:20:51| versus maybe the real strict interpretation of what that money is to be used for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8451)|
| 2:20:58| That's not my description.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8458)|
| 2:21:00| That is the actual finance department's account description.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8460)|
| 2:21:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8465)|
| 2:21:06| So the way it reads, it's food supplies, utensils, you know, plates, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8466)|
| 2:21:15| But it does not make any reference to eating meals at restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8475)|
| 2:21:22| I guess my question would be to John Troyer if he could answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8482)|
| 2:21:26| I don't know if we can get into that yet, Mr. Chairman, or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8486)|
| 2:21:29| I'd like to add just while we're on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8489)|
| 2:21:32| if you go back to Mr. Walls' December 2006 PCARD audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8492)|
| 2:21:36| local meals were acknowledged in his 2006 audit as prevalent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8496)|
| 2:21:42| And so, I mean, I don't have it in front of me to read, but I think we've got one here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8502)|
| 2:21:49| Item number three, when the PCARD was initially established,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8509)|
| 2:21:52| travel, entertainment, lodging, and meal purchases were not permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8512)|
| 2:21:56| Since that time, certain employees have been granted permission to use the purchasing card for these transactions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8516)|
| 2:22:02| While there does not appear to be any material abuse of these privileges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8522)|
| 2:22:06| the risk of misuse or lax record keeping does exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8526)|
| 2:22:09| So in Mr. Walls' own report of December 22, 2006, he acknowledges local meals back then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8529)|
| 2:22:16| Mr. Walls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8536)|
| 2:22:17| But I also acknowledge that there's a risk of misuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8537)|
| 2:22:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8541)|
| 2:22:23| So I guess it's sort of left us in a quandary as commissioners as to if a local meal that was charged to a PCARD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8543)|
| 2:22:37| does it fall within the food budget that was approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8557)|
| 2:22:43| or do we have to do we adhere to the very strict interpretation of what you're saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8563)|
| 2:22:49| and then trying to use maybe some common sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8569)|
| 2:22:55| And I guess, John Troyer, the food budget that was passed by county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8575)|
| 2:23:04| and you got the line item for food, what was the intent of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8584)|
| 2:23:11| I think we all know what food is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8591)|
| 2:23:13| I think, you know, county commissioners are drinking coffee today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8593)|
| 2:23:16| and I understand there's been, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8596)|
| 2:23:18| usually there's some food items up there for county commissioners to share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8598)|
| 2:23:21| And that's charged to food, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8601)|
| 2:23:24| And I believe it's being charged to the sheriffs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8604)|
| 2:23:27| And so I think we all understand what food is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8607)|
| 2:23:30| and I don't think we need a definition of food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8610)|
| 2:23:35| When Mr. Walls says that it's like things like utensils| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8615)|
| 2:23:40| and that is within the description of that line, is that an accurate portrayal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8620)|
| 2:23:45| Is that an accurate portrayal of what that line item says?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8625)|
| 2:23:48| I think we all know what food is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8628)|
| 2:23:50| Well, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8630)|
| 2:23:52| What I'm asking you is Richard Walls is saying that that line item describes what it's for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8632)|
| 2:24:01| Is that an accurate description?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8641)|
| 2:24:05| I think it is an accurate description| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8645)|
| 2:24:07| and I think I'm just reminded of our response to the audit on page 25 where, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8647)|
| 2:24:13| again, the county commission establishes its intent through the official minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8653)|
| 2:24:17| and through the adoption of the budget document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8657)|
| 2:24:19| And there are numerous, as the law director has indicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8659)|
| 2:24:23| numerous food and line items for numerous departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8663)|
| 2:24:29| And I guess going back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8669)|
| 2:24:30| I need to wrap it up too, Greg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8670)|
| 2:24:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8671)|
| 2:24:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8672)|
| 2:24:33| Just real quick, Richard, your response to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8673)|
| 2:24:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8679)|
| 2:24:40| The food account actually falls under supplies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8680)|
| 2:24:44| And, you know, as we described it, you know, it doesn't include meals at restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8684)|
| 2:24:49| and that's what was being charged there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8689)|
| 2:24:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8692)|
| 2:24:53| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8693)|
| 2:24:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8695)|
| 2:24:57| Richard, as mentioned, I'm drinking a cup of coffee that was provided by the Knox County Sheriff's Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8697)|
| 2:25:01| that was purchased on a P card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8701)|
| 2:25:03| Am I violating the policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8703)|
| 2:25:07| That's not at all what I'm referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8707)|
| 2:25:08| No, but I mean, if we can't have food locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8708)|
| 2:25:12| I'm talking about at Regus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8712)|
| 2:25:16| But if you go out and have it brought in, I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8716)|
| 2:25:19| And I think there would be a difference there if you were having a meeting and have food brought in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8719)|
| 2:25:24| I can see that being part of your budget, but not going out to lunch often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8724)|
| 2:25:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8731)|
| 2:25:32| I'm only speaking as one commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8732)|
| 2:25:34| When I approve the budget and there's a line item there for food, it's my feeling that that office holder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8734)|
| 2:25:41| whether it's the trustee or the property assessor, the sheriff, whomever it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8741)|
| 2:25:45| that that budget is there for them to use appropriately for business purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8745)|
| 2:25:51| And so I want our chief executive to have lunch with a CEO of a major company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8751)|
| 2:25:57| that is considering this area to locate a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8757)|
| 2:26:00| I want the sheriff to meet with the head of the FBI and perhaps buy them lunch if they need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8760)|
| 2:26:05| I want the trustee to take a local banker to lunch if it's appropriate and if it's business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8765)|
| 2:26:10| I don't have problems with that, and it would seem to me that when you have that food budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8770)|
| 2:26:15| that's what that's for as long as it's appropriate and as long as it's documented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8775)|
| 2:26:19| And so it would seem to me, Mr. Law Director, that if we at $77,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8779)|
| 2:26:26| I dare say that if you audit every office holder in this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8786)|
| 2:26:30| you're going to find that they have all done the same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8790)|
| 2:26:34| that they have taken people to lunch at local restaurants and for business purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8794)|
| 2:26:38| Maybe they have bought pizza for some people at a senior citizen center, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8798)|
| 2:26:44| But, Mr. Law Director, I just got to ask you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8804)|
| 2:26:46| You'll find one that hasn't, and that's the one sitting here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8806)|
| 2:26:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8810)|
| 2:26:51| And we need to give you five dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8811)|
| 2:26:53| I don't have a food budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8813)|
| 2:26:55| But in passing the food budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8815)|
| 2:26:57| would it not be reasonable to assume that the intent of the county commission was to allow these office holders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8817)|
| 2:27:02| to have this budget for business purposes at local restaurants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8822)|
| 2:27:06| That can be easily assumed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8826)|
| 2:27:08| And, you know, when we're looking at matters like this, we and they're important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8828)|
| 2:27:15| And you can't assume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8835)|
| 2:27:18| I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8838)|
| 2:27:22| I can't go to court based on an assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8842)|
| 2:27:29| That's not what I wish to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8849)|
| 2:27:33| You know, just like you say, you're drinking a cup of coffee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8853)|
| 2:27:40| Under Mr. Wall, under a strict interpretation of our travel policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8860)|
| 2:27:47| then you would be violating our code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8867)|
| 2:27:53| You would be violating our code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8873)|
| 2:27:57| And the commission passes a budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8877)|
| 2:28:00| The one thing that you have, the 19 members of this commission has, is power over the purse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8880)|
| 2:28:06| And in my conversations with the comptroller, basically a lot of what is said boils down to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8886)|
| 2:28:14| well, you may need to address that in this coming year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8894)|
| 2:28:19| And I certainly hope you address the food budgets in the next year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8899)|
| 2:28:25| And that's just me personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8905)|
| 2:28:27| But you have a legal obligation with at least two departments of county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8907)|
| 2:28:33| or two aspects of county government to provide food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8913)|
| 2:28:37| I don't know what the other is used for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8917)|
| 2:28:39| You have passed a budget before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8919)|
| 2:28:41| If you've seen a budget item, if it's your understanding, Commissioner Hammond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8921)|
| 2:28:45| that the mayor is certainly within his authority to spend those monies to treat the governor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8925)|
| 2:28:52| to treat someone else or some CEO of a corporation who wishes to come into Knox County to do business in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8932)|
| 2:28:59| And it's seen as a way to do that and to engage in discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8939)|
| 2:29:02| If you see that as a proper method and that's the way you see that line item, who am I to argue with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8942)|
| 2:29:10| And who is Mr. Walls to argue with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8950)|
| 2:29:12| And I don't know that anyone else can argue with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8952)|
| 2:29:15| He's laid out the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8955)|
| 2:29:17| And, you know, legally, we don't want to just make assumptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8957)|
| 2:29:24| We need strictly defined policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8964)|
| 2:29:29| And this one is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8969)|
| 2:29:31| It's just not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8971)|
| 2:29:33| There was a budget that was passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8973)|
| 2:29:35| You have one view of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8975)|
| 2:29:38| Other commissioners who passed the budget, I don't know, you may have other views.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8978)|
| 2:29:45| But that's not something I wish to go to chance to record it with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080519specialpart1?start=8985)|
