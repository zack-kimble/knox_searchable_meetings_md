| 2:07:47| counsel and proceed anyway which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7667)|
| 2:07:49| is all on the taxpayer dime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7669)|
| 2:07:51| and so to make it very very clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7671)|
| 2:07:53| going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7673)|
| 2:07:55| it is making it very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7675)|
| 2:07:57| very clear based upon, you know, sometimes rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7677)|
| 2:07:59| are made because there's a very specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7679)|
| 2:08:01| infraction of that rule so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7681)|
| 2:08:03| going forward it makes it very very clear that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7683)|
| 2:08:05| this is not something to ever be addressed again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7685)|
| 2:08:07| because the combination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7687)|
| 2:08:09| of that one case plus two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7689)|
| 2:08:11| other cases that in my opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7691)|
| 2:08:13| were very political| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7693)|
| 2:08:15| for a very distinct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7695)|
| 2:08:17| amount of time during an election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7697)|
| 2:08:19| and have all magically gone away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7699)|
| 2:08:21| in the last 30 days has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7701)|
| 2:08:23| cost to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7703)|
| 2:08:25| date $479,122| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7705)|
| 2:08:27| for taxpayer money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7707)|
| 2:08:29| and so yeah there is some language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7709)|
| 2:08:31| in here that says here is what a grievance is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7711)|
| 2:08:33| and here is what it isn't because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7713)|
| 2:08:35| I want to make sure going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7715)|
| 2:08:37| we don't leave any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7717)|
| 2:08:39| loopholes open so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7719)|
| 2:08:41| any merit counsel can say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7721)|
| 2:08:43| we are choosing to ignore our own rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7723)|
| 2:08:45| and choosing to ignore how we proceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7725)|
| 2:08:47| and making up stuff that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7727)|
| 2:08:49| going to cost the taxpayers more and more and more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7729)|
| 2:08:51| money so that yes there is some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7731)|
| 2:08:53| specific language that sort of kind of closes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7733)|
| 2:08:55| the gaps and says let us be very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7735)|
| 2:08:57| clear here's what you can file a grievance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7737)|
| 2:08:59| for and here's what you can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7739)|
| 2:09:01| and then if there's even language here that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7741)|
| 2:09:03| says if a grievance is filed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7743)|
| 2:09:05| and it checks box A through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7745)|
| 2:09:07| whatever then outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7747)|
| 2:09:09| merit counsel is automatically triggered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7749)|
| 2:09:11| and we have a mechanism for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7751)|
| 2:09:13| so that it's not just the taxpayer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7753)|
| 2:09:15| dollars flying out the door so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7755)|
| 2:09:17| I hope that helps kind of bring it back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7757)|
| 2:09:19| Senate. And I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7759)|
| 2:09:21| appreciate what you said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7761)|
| 2:09:23| although| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7763)|
| 2:09:25| going back even further I believe the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7765)|
| 2:09:27| whole thing did come down to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7767)|
| 2:09:29| political retribution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7769)|
| 2:09:31| issue that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7771)|
| 2:09:33| you know that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7773)|
| 2:09:35| the deal and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7775)|
| 2:09:39| like I said I don't have an answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7779)|
| 2:09:41| I'm not real sure we'd fix that one either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7781)|
| 2:09:43| and I'm not but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7783)|
| 2:09:45| I'm just frustrated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7785)|
| 2:09:47| There's some things that are human| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7787)|
| 2:09:49| nature that we're not going to be able to fix| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7789)|
| 2:09:51| but the goal and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7791)|
| 2:09:53| continue to work on reforms is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7793)|
| 2:09:55| make a better more fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7795)|
| 2:09:57| and very distinct system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7797)|
| 2:09:59| in which officers know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7799)|
| 2:10:01| what their protections are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7801)|
| 2:10:03| and have those protections in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7803)|
| 2:10:05| and those are not up for a whole lot of interpretation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7805)|
| 2:10:07| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7807)|
| 2:10:09| that you have a bigger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7809)|
| 2:10:11| broader board with more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7811)|
| 2:10:13| diversity and more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7813)|
| 2:10:15| less ability to sort of have small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7815)|
| 2:10:17| fiefdoms so to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7817)|
| 2:10:19| and you have a broader board that can look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7819)|
| 2:10:21| at it and interpret it with a legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7821)|
| 2:10:23| counsel that can go here's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7823)|
| 2:10:25| the process and here's not the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7825)|
| 2:10:27| I find it really concerning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7827)|
| 2:10:29| as I have said for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7829)|
| 2:10:31| two years now. I found| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7831)|
| 2:10:33| it very concerning that we've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7833)|
| 2:10:35| a mayor council that can essentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7835)|
| 2:10:37| make up their own rules, change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7837)|
| 2:10:39| their rules and operate how they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7839)|
| 2:10:41| want to without a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7841)|
| 2:10:43| of oversight. That we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7843)|
| 2:10:45| a staff that is essentially unsupervised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7845)|
| 2:10:47| that doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7847)|
| 2:10:49| have oversight and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7849)|
| 2:10:51| that we don't have a lot of checks and balances but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7851)|
| 2:10:53| at the end of the day the taxpayers are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7853)|
| 2:10:55| footing the bill and this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7855)|
| 2:10:57| is liable for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7857)|
| 2:10:59| the responsibility of it governing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7859)|
| 2:11:01| The goal in doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7861)|
| 2:11:03| this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7863)|
| 2:11:05| to make a better mousetrap going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7865)|
| 2:11:07| and I hope that it'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7867)|
| 2:11:09| address certain things. It may not address everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7869)|
| 2:11:11| we may have to continue to sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7871)|
| 2:11:13| tweak as we go but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7873)|
| 2:11:15| I hope that everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7875)|
| 2:11:17| sees that we put a lot of thought into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7877)|
| 2:11:19| trying to figure out how to honor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7879)|
| 2:11:21| the fact that we do have employees and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7881)|
| 2:11:23| that they do have an important role and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7883)|
| 2:11:25| that has oversight and structure now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7885)|
| 2:11:27| and that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7887)|
| 2:11:29| do have an entity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7889)|
| 2:11:31| that is important for the officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7891)|
| 2:11:33| This conversation started a long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7893)|
| 2:11:35| ago when I spoke directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7895)|
| 2:11:37| to officers in the field and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7897)|
| 2:11:39| many of them said I would never| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7899)|
| 2:11:41| file a grievance because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7901)|
| 2:11:43| there's not a chance I'd have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7903)|
| 2:11:45| fair shot and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7905)|
| 2:11:47| how this whole thing began. So I'd like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7907)|
| 2:11:49| to step back and say I hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7909)|
| 2:11:51| this in its current sense without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7911)|
| 2:11:53| any other cases says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7913)|
| 2:11:55| we can make a good fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7915)|
| 2:11:57| honest system that can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7917)|
| 2:11:59| be both beneficial to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7919)|
| 2:12:01| officers, our sheriffs and our commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7921)|
| 2:12:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7923)|
| 2:12:05| And I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7925)|
| 2:12:07| I appreciate everyone's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7927)|
| 2:12:09| efforts. This really is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7929)|
| 2:12:11| directed. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7931)|
| 2:12:13| just more frustration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7933)|
| 2:12:15| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7935)|
| 2:12:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7937)|
| 2:12:19| I appreciate your efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7939)|
| 2:12:21| too, Commissioner Jay and I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7941)|

| 2:12:25| to make this the best it can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7945)|
| 2:12:27| but I am somewhat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7947)|
| 2:12:29| concerned whenever we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7949)|
| 2:12:31| limit the pool to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7951)|
| 2:12:33| ten years outside employment with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7953)|
| 2:12:35| Knox County Sheriff's Office or KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7955)|
| 2:12:37| related to no one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7957)|
| 2:12:39| that is currently employed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7959)|
| 2:12:41| and is non-political.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7961)|
| 2:12:43| I'm not sure where we're going to find seven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7963)|
| 2:12:45| people. Are we going to have to go to the HR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7965)|
| 2:12:47| retirement home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7967)|
| 2:12:53| And it is the job of this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7973)|
| 2:12:55| to be that oversight, to appoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7975)|
| 2:12:57| those people to those positions and remove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7977)|
| 2:12:59| those people from those positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7979)|
| 2:13:01| if we don't like what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7981)|
| 2:13:05| And it's also our job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7985)|
| 2:13:07| to oversee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7987)|
| 2:13:09| internal audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7989)|
| 2:13:11| There's several functions we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7991)|
| 2:13:13| have that sometimes we don't fully take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7993)|
| 2:13:15| responsibility for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7995)|
| 2:13:17| And I would make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7997)|
| 2:13:19| this one suggestion. With seven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=7999)|
| 2:13:21| members, I think we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8001)|
| 2:13:23| to stagger these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8003)|
| 2:13:25| So I would suggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8005)|
| 2:13:27| amending it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8007)|
| 2:13:29| four appointed for four years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8009)|
| 2:13:31| and three appointed for two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8011)|
| 2:13:33| and those terms become| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8013)|
| 2:13:35| four years after that initial two year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8015)|
| 2:13:37| I think there is some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8017)|
| 2:13:39| language in here about staggering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8019)|
| 2:13:41| It doesn't say how to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8021)|
| 2:13:43| It doesn't say how to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8023)|
| 2:13:47| I'm starting to find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8027)|
| 2:13:49| If you can help me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8029)|
| 2:13:51| Page...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8031)|
| 2:13:53| Where is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8033)|
| 2:13:59| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8039)|
| 2:14:05| Why am I missing it? I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8045)|
| 2:14:07| Page two at the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8047)|
| 2:14:09| Part B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8049)|
| 2:14:11| Say that again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8051)|
| 2:14:13| Page two, part B at the very top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8053)|
| 2:14:15| Got it. Here we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8055)|
| 2:14:17| May be appointed for shorter term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8057)|
| 2:14:19| in order to create staggered term system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8059)|
| 2:14:21| That's written| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8061)|
| 2:14:23| in less specificity because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8063)|
| 2:14:27| the idea would be to pass the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8067)|
| 2:14:29| and then essentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8069)|
| 2:14:31| this body would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8071)|
| 2:14:33| create a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8073)|
| 2:14:35| outlining those board terms because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8075)|
| 2:14:37| there are current board members that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8077)|
| 2:14:39| serving in there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8079)|
| 2:14:41| It's not specified exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8081)|
| 2:14:43| in this. It just says to stagger them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8083)|
| 2:14:45| And then I think as we do a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8085)|
| 2:14:47| appointing the new board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8087)|
| 2:14:49| and you would look at the current board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8089)|
| 2:14:51| members and say, okay, these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8091)|
| 2:14:53| three are on this term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8093)|
| 2:14:55| I think that's to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8095)|
| 2:14:57| is what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8097)|
| 2:14:59| Does this say how long the terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8099)|
| 2:15:01| are currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8101)|
| 2:15:03| Currently the terms are three years with one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8103)|
| 2:15:05| renewable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8105)|
| 2:15:11| I have hope that we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8111)|
| 2:15:13| find people that will...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8113)|
| 2:15:15| We've had several applications for the last couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8115)|
| 2:15:17| of rounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8117)|
| 2:15:19| There are currently people on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8119)|
| 2:15:21| board that are looking at this and will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8121)|
| 2:15:23| have to say, yeah, I want to be an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8123)|
| 2:15:25| apolitical person and continue to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8125)|
| 2:15:27| They may decide not to but we've also had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8127)|
| 2:15:29| several other applicants come to us in the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8129)|
| 2:15:31| little bit without much advertising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8131)|
| 2:15:33| or discussion amongst us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8133)|
| 2:15:35| seeking them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8135)|
| 2:15:37| I have faith in the people of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8137)|
| 2:15:39| County that will come up and say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8139)|
| 2:15:41| this is important and it's an important part of civic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8141)|
| 2:15:43| duty and I'm willing to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8143)|

| 2:15:55| I too am very tired of this coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8155)|
| 2:15:57| before us. I also have been working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8157)|
| 2:15:59| on this since November of 2020| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8159)|
| 2:16:01| when the first special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8161)|
| 2:16:03| committee meeting was called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8163)|
| 2:16:05| but at the same time it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8165)|
| 2:16:07| incredibly important that we get this right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8167)|
| 2:16:09| and I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8169)|
| 2:16:11| like to extend a professional courtesy to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8171)|

| 2:16:15| acquiring this whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8175)|
| 2:16:17| package that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8177)|
| 2:16:19| postpone this for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8179)|
| 2:16:21| I make a substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8181)|
| 2:16:23| to postpone this for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8183)|
| 2:16:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8185)|
| 2:16:27| We have a substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8187)|
| 2:16:29| by Commissioner Dart with a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8189)|

| 2:16:33| still open for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8193)|
| 2:16:35| Commissioner Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8195)|
| 2:16:37| We're in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8197)|
| 2:16:39| we've got to give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8199)|
| 2:16:41| both sides have got to give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8201)|
| 2:16:43| to where we can get a document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8203)|
| 2:16:45| that hopefully works for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8205)|
| 2:16:47| Maybe we can change it later on if we have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8207)|
| 2:16:49| I'm not for postponing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8209)|
| 2:16:51| for this reason. We need to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8211)|
| 2:16:53| We need to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8213)|
| 2:16:55| for next Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8215)|
| 2:16:57| follow up on these questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8217)|
| 2:16:59| so come next Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8219)|
| 2:17:01| we need the budget to postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8221)|
| 2:17:03| Maybe I'll be open for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8223)|
| 2:17:05| Maybe I'll be open for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8225)|
| 2:17:07| Right now we can still keep on discussing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8227)|
| 2:17:09| keep an open mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8229)|
| 2:17:11| and keep on discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8231)|
| 2:17:13| I don't think postponing 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8233)|
| 2:17:15| would really help us in the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8235)|
| 2:17:17| of where do we get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8237)|
| 2:17:23| Commissioner Busley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8243)|
| 2:17:25| Thank you. So as of right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8245)|
| 2:17:27| we have no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220621?start=8247)|
